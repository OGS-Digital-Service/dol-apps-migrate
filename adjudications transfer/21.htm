<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant Gruber graduated from
Mount Sinai Medical&nbsp;school&nbsp;in May 1983 and received a medical degree.
He was employed as a research assistant for the New York City Department of
Health from July 15, 1983 through June 13, 1984. He resigned from the City post
to accept a position in a medical residency program at St. Luke's, which is a
teaching hospital accredited by the AMA.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Gruber's contract with St. Luke's
was executed on March 22, 1984 and covered a one-year term to commence on July
1, 1984. However, claimant received permission to begin rendering his services
for the hospital at an earlier date, and began making rounds on June 18, 1984.
After only several days at the hospital, claimant became emotionally ill and
was hospitalized. He never returned to the residency program.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>{1}&nbsp;For&nbsp;clarification of
the statutory definition of &quot;employment&quot; refer to the
&quot;COMMENTS&quot; section of this release.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Gruber filed a claim for unemployment
insurance benefits. By initial determination, the local unemployment office
concluded that Gruber's &quot;last employment&quot; within the meaning of Labor
Law Sec. 593(1) was with St. Luke's, that he lost such employment because of
illness --a non-disqualifying condition -- and thus that he was eligible to
receive unemployment insurance. The office determined that claimant's
employment with St. Luke's was not &quot;covered&quot; employment, and thus
charged the City of&nbsp;New York&nbsp;for claimant's benefits under Labor Law
Sec. 581(1)(e) as claimant's &quot;last employer.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Respondent City of New York
objected to the ruling, contending that...if claimant's employment with St.
Luke's is deemed to be &quot;student services&quot; excluded from the
definition of covered employment, then the City Department of Health should be
deemed claimant's &quot;last employer,&quot; but claimant should be deemed
ineligible to receive benefits because he left that employment with the City to
pursue his education -- a disqualifying condition.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>A hearing was then held before an
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the New York State Department of Labor. The
ALJ concluded that claimant was eligible for benefits and that claimant's
employment with St. Luke's did not fall under the exception created by Labor
Law Sec. 511(15) because claimant's service as a medical resident did not
constitute &quot;services rendered for an educational institution by a person
who is enrolled and is in regular attendance as a student in such an
institution.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On appeal taken by the Commissioner
of Labor and St. Luke's, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board determined
that claimant's services at St. Luke's did fall within the section 511(15)
exception to the definition of employment, and St. Luke's was not liable for
claimant's benefits. However, The Appeal Board determined that for purposes of
Labor Law Sec. 593(1), &quot;claimant's last employment was with St. Luke's and
he left this employment with good cause and under&nbsp;nondisqualifying&nbsp;conditions.&quot;
The board reasoned that the term &quot;employment&quot; as used in section
593(1) meant&nbsp;<u>any</u>&nbsp;employment, not only covered employment as
defined in Labor Law Sec. 511. Thus, the Board concluded that the City
Department of Health was primarily chargeable for claimant's benefits because
that employment was &quot;covered.&quot; The Appellate Division affirmed. We
granted the City's motion for leave to Appeal, and now reverse.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In this case, the question of law
is whether the words &quot;last employment&quot; contained in Labor Law Sec.
593(1) refer to the last covered &quot;employment&quot; as that term is defined
in Labor Law Sec. 511, or whether in this context the phrase refers to any
employment, including those not covered by the article. The Legislature has
defined with precision both the underlying scheme (Labor Law Sec. 501) and the
term &quot;employment&quot; in the Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor Law Sec.
511), and has directed that statutory definitions are to be applied to
interpret the article unless the context shows otherwise (Labor Law Sec.
510)....Thus, the statutory definition of &quot;employment&quot; and its
exceptions will govern our interpretation of the words &quot;last employment&quot;
in section 593(1) unless the context shows a different meaning was intended.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Neither the language nor the
context of section 593(1) shows that the Legislature intended to depart from
the statutory definition of the term &quot;employment&quot; in that context.
The absence of any such indication is especially significant because the
Legislature has revealed its intention to include in the term
&quot;employment&quot; work not covered by the article by expressly so
providing in the text of the particular statutory sections (<u>see e.g.</u>&nbsp;Labor
Law&nbsp;Secs. 518; 522; 593{2}). For example, in Labor Law Sec. 522, the
Legislature defined the eligibility requirement of &quot;total
unemployment,&quot; as &quot;the total lack of any employment on any day&quot;
and expressly provided within the context of that section that &quot;the term
'employment' as used in this section means&nbsp;<u>any employment including
that not defined in this title</u>&quot; (emphasis supplied). Similarly,
subdivision 2 of section 593, the provision that concerns disqualifications for
refusal to accept employment without good cause and that immediately follows
the provision at issue here, expressly provides that disqualification of an
otherwise eligible claimant would result where the claimant &quot;refuses to
accept an offer of employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and
experience,&nbsp;<u>including employments not subject to this article</u>&quot;
(Labor Law Sec. 593{2} {emphasis supplied}). Given that the legislature used
distinct language in subdivision 2 when it intended to include employments
other than those included in the statutory definition of the term
&quot;employment&quot; (Labor Law Sec. 510), the absence of similar language in
the text of the immediately preceding subdivision of the same section indicates
that no departure from the statutory definition of that term was intended or implied.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Accordingly, the order of the
Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the matter remitted
to the Appellate Division, Third Department, with directions to remand to the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board for further proceedings in accordance with
the opinion herein.</span></p>

employed by the City of New York Department of Health and by
the&nbsp;College&nbsp;of&nbsp;Staten Island&nbsp;as a teacher while enrolled in
a Master's Degree program at the latter institution. He voluntarily terminated
his employment with the City Department of Health on May 24, 1991 to pursue his
education. Greene's last day of teaching was May 30, 1991, although he remained

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Greene filed an application for
benefits, and the local office ruled that he was eligible. The City of&nbsp;New
York&nbsp;objected and a hearing was held before a State Department of Labor
ALJ. The ALJ found that claimant was eligible for benefits, concluding that
&quot;although claimant's last employment was not covered employment pursuant
to section 511.15, it is nevertheless employment which should be considered to
adjust the issue of who the last employ(er) (sic) was and under which
circumstances the last employment came to an end * * *.&quot; The ALJ concluded
that claimant's employment with the college was his last employment &quot;and
although that was not covered employment it is not self-employment and it may
be counted to break the disqualification that is apparent for voluntary(ily)
(sic) leaving the municipal employment.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The City appealed. The Appeal Board
adopted the findings of fact and opinion of the ALJ and confirmed the ALJ's
determination. The Appeal Board concluded that Greene's work as a teacher was
not covered employment and should not be considered in computing his benefit
rate or experience rating charges. Nonetheless, the Appeal Board concluded that
claimant was eligible for benefits because his &quot;last employment was at
school and * * * it ended under&nbsp;nondisqualifying&nbsp;conditions.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Appellate Division affirmed.
The court reasoned that &quot;although claimant's employment with the College
was not 'covered' employment it was nevertheless sufficient to break claimant's
prior disqualification which resulted when he left his job with the City.&quot;
The court noted that &quot;Labor Law Sec. 593(1)(a) does not specify that a
claimant's 'last' employment must be 'covered' employment for purposes of
disqualification.&quot; The court concluded that since claimant left his actual
last employment with the College under&nbsp;nondisqualifying&nbsp;conditions,
the Appeal Board's decision that claimant was eligible for benefits was
supported by &quot;substantial evidence.&quot; This Court granted the City's

in the statutory definition of the term &quot;employment&quot; (Labor Law Sec. 510),
the absence of similar language in the text of the immediately preceding
subdivision of the same section indicates that no departure from the statutory
definition of that term was intended or implied.</span></p>

three days in each of five weeks and earn(s) remuneration at least equal to
five times his weekly benefit rate&quot; (Labor Law Sec. 593{1-4} {emphasis

underscored term &quot;employment&quot; should be given any other meaning than
that defined by the Legislature. Thus, for example, a claimant's eligibility
for unemployment benefits may be revived after loss of earlier covered
employment without good cause when the claimant is involuntarily removed from

receiving benefits upon his voluntary departure from covered employment, and

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant was employed by a&nbsp;New York&nbsp;employer from April 10, 1988,
through January 21, 1996. He filed a claim for benefits in&nbsp;New
York&nbsp;State. His benefit rate was calculated to be $300. By initial determination
issued February 23, 1996, the claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits
effective January 25, 1996, because of a voluntary leaving of employment
without good cause. The claimant accepted employment as an insurance auditor
with the employer herein and moved to&nbsp;South Carolina. The parties agreed
that the claimant would be paid at the rate of $21 per hour for each audit
hour. The claimant earned $1,776.25.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On January 31, 1996, the claimant
met with the employer and received numerous assignments, forms and information
on how to complete the assignments. He spent February 1, and 2, 1996,
familiarizing himself with the procedures to use and the computer system, and
scheduling appointments. The claimant audited the assigned cases on these
dated: February 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, and
March 7, 1996. On March 4, and 5, 1996, the claimant performed services for the
employer for which he submitted vouchers for expense reimbursement. The
claimant thereafter left this employment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The employer does no business
in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;and is not registered here. The employer is a registered
employer in&nbsp;North Carolina&nbsp;and pays assessed sums into the North
and&nbsp;South Carolina&nbsp;systems for possible unemployment insurance
claims. The employer does business in North and&nbsp;South Carolina.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

1996.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that for the week ending February 4, 1996, the
claimant worked the three days of January 31, February 1, and 2, 1996. For the
week ending February 11, 1996, the claimant did not work at least three days.
For the week ending February 18, 1996, the claimant worked in excess of three
days on February 12,13,14,15, and 16, 1996. For the week ending February 25,
1996, the claimant worked in excess of three days on February 19, 20, 21, 22,
and 23, 1996. For the week ending March 3, 1996, the claimant worked in excess
of three days on February 26, 27, 28, and 29, 1996. For the week ending March
10, 1996, the claimant worked on the three days of March 4, 5, and 7, 1996. We
hold that the claimant worked at least three days in five weeks during the
period of January 31, 1996, and March 7, 1996.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The question becomes whether the
claimant earned five times his benefit rate or at least $1,500. The credible
evidence establishes that the claimant earned $1,776.25 during this period. We
have considered the fact that the W-2 submitted by the employer shows that the
claimant only earned $919.96. We are persuaded by the claimant’s contention
that he was really paid $21 an hour for 84 audit hours in light of the
employer’s concession that the claimant was paid at the rate of $21 an hour,
the claimant had to pay his own expenses out of this and it was broken down
into expenses and income for withholding purposes. We hold that the claimant worked
at least three days in five weeks during the period of January 31, 1996, and
March 7, 1996 and earned $1,776.25 which is in excess of the required sum of
$1,500.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The question now becomes whether
the claimant’s employment is covered employment, which may be used to terminate
his outstanding disqualification. Labor Law Section 593(1)(a) states that no
days of total unemployment shall be deemed to occur after a claimant has
voluntarily separated without good cause from his last employment prior to the
filing of a claim until he has &quot;subsequently worked in&nbsp;<u>employment</u>&nbsp;on
not less than three days in each of five weeks and earned remuneration at least
equal to five times his weekly benefit rate.&quot; (emphasis supplied) If this
claimant’s out-of-state work is covered employment within the meaning of
Section 593, then he has accumulated enough weeks and wages to terminate the
outstanding disqualification.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The general definition of
&quot;employment&quot; is found in Labor Law Section 511(1) which provides that
&quot;Employment means any service under any contract of employment for hire,
express or implied, written, or oral and any service by a person for an
employer.&quot; Such employment has been construed to mean &quot;covered
employment.&quot; See&nbsp;<u>Matter of Gruber</u>, 89 NY 2d 225 at 233 (1996).
Labor Law Section 510 states that &quot;whenever used in this article, the
terms defined in this title have the respective meaning set forth herein except
where the context show otherwise.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>At various places in the Labor Law,
the Legislature has specified when it wanted the term employment to include
non-covered employment. For example, Labor Law Section 522 defines total
unemployment to mean, &quot;The total lack of any employment on any day. The
term ‘employment’ as used in this section means any employment including that
not defined in this title.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The question arises because of the
aforementioned&nbsp;<u>Gruber</u>&nbsp;case. Therein, the Court of appeals
concluded that a claimant, who separated from covered employment from a
disqualifying reason, who later worked at non covered employment and who
subsequently separated from the non-covered employment under non-disqualifying
circumstances, may not revive his eligibility for benefits because he never
obtained subsequent &quot;employment.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although this is a case of first
impression, a guidepost may be found in the Interstate Benefit Payment Plan of
1938, to which&nbsp;New York&nbsp;has long been a party pursuant to the
authorization in Labor Law Section 536(2). This interstate compact prescribes
that states act as each other’s agents in order to provide access to
unemployment insurance to claimants who have moved to a different state. Under
this, and similar compacts, the states are to work together to effectuate a
method of payment for claimants who might otherwise be deprived of benefits
because of their absence from a state in which their benefit credits had been
accumulated.</span></p>

unemployment system but inhibit among workers a very desirable mobility which
is important to our economy.&quot; (H.R. No. 612, 91<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Congress

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant worked many years
in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;before losing that employment under disqualifying
circumstances and moving out of state to find new employment. The question of
the claimant’s separation from his out-of-state employment is not before us. It
was concluded that the claimant voluntarily separated from this out-of-state
employment with good cause in Administrative Law Judge decision dated August
15, 1996, in case number 096-16941. When the claimant filed a&nbsp;South
Carolina&nbsp;claim effective March 4, 1996, this established a base period
from March 6, 1995, to March 3, 1996. Both his&nbsp;New York&nbsp;employment
and out-of-state employment were during his base period.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We are not unmindful that the
aforementioned Law Section 511 also defines certain classes of employment which
have a sufficient nexus to&nbsp;New York&nbsp;State&nbsp;to be considered
covered employment so that they may be the basis of a valid original claim
filed in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;State. These subsections are inapplicable here
since this case does not involve the question of whether the
claimant’s&nbsp;South Carolina&nbsp;employment could have been the basis of a
valid original claim filed in&nbsp;New York. On the contrary, the question
before us is whether the claimant’s&nbsp;South Carolina&nbsp;employment may be
used to terminate a disqualification.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We have considered the policies
inherent in the interstate compacts and believe that their spirit of providing
redress throughout the country to individuals who are unemployed through no
fault of their own is best effectuated by recognizing this out-of-state
employment as covered employment for the purposes of terminating a
disqualification. In this light, we decline to extend the Court of Appeals
interpretation of &quot;employment&quot; in the&nbsp;<u>Gruber</u>&nbsp;case to
this context.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We hold that the claimant’s
employment in&nbsp;south Carolina&nbsp;for a registered employer in that State
is covered employment in this context. To hold otherwise could have the effect
of freezing a claimant’s free exercise of his right to travel and live anywhere
in the&nbsp;United States. Since the claimant worked at least three days a week
in five weeks, in covered employment, earning in excess of his weekly benefit
rate, we conclude that the claimant terminated his outstanding
disqualification.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant was employed as a driver by a business machine dealership for more
than three years, until March 10, 1997. He worked a full-time schedule and
earned $9.50 per hour. On March 7, 1997, the employer was notified that its
liability insurance carrier would no longer extend coverage to the claimant
because he was regarded as an unacceptable risk. At that time, the employer was
informed that during his employment, the claimant had recorded against his
driver's license seven moving violations, a registration and an inspection
violation, and a two-month suspension in late 1996, for failure to promptly
respond to numerous parking tickets. The employer was not previously aware of
this suspension, because the claimant continued reporting to work and operating
the vehicle assigned to him, despite the lack of a valid license. Although his
license was reinstated prior to March 7, 1997, the employer discharged him
rather than seek coverage for him from another insurer.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the claimant was discharged after his
employer’s insurance carrier announced that it would no longer assume the risk
of insuring him, due to his past driving record. While the employer may have
felt itself justified in dismissing the claimant, in the belief that he
culpably failed to maintain an acceptable driving record, that issue is not now
before the Board. The initial determination under review was issued by the
local office in the mistaken belief that the claimant’s license had been
revoked, thereby compelling the employer to discharge him. In fact, it is
uncontested that the claimant’s license was not subject to any revocation,
suspension or other restriction at the time of his discharge. Accordingly, the
initial determination was properly overruled.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On appeal to the Board, the
Commissioner of Labor now seeks to alter the basis for disqualification by
proposing that the claimant’s conduct in acquiring his driving record, and the
resulting refusal of the employer’s insurer to extend coverage to him, so
provoked the employer to discharge the claimant as to be tantamount to a
voluntary quit under the Unemployment Insurance Law. We do not think that the
record and the law support such a conclusion.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The doctrine of &quot;provoked
discharge&quot; is a very limited one. It provides that where a worker, by his
culpable actions or omissions, leaves his employer no other choice but to
discharge him, the worker may thereby be deemed effectively to have quit his
job under disqualifying conditions. In such instances, an employer must be
without any range of discretion and must be compelled to dispense with the
worker’s services; as where a worker fails to join or maintain membership in a
union, as a condition of his employment (<u>Matter of&nbsp;Malaspina</u>, 309
NY 413) or loses a license which is an essential prerequisite of his job (<u>Matter
of Lenoir</u>, 176 AD 2d 428).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Board has long held that there
can be no benefit disqualification under the theory of &quot;provoked
discharge&quot; where a validly licensed employee is fired solely because his
employer’s insurance carrier has declined to continue covering that employee,
due to his poor driving record (Appeal Board 245,749). Clearly, such an
employer is not without any option but to discharge the employee, since it can
seek the threatened insurance coverage elsewhere. We are aware that a later
Board decision pronounced a contrary conclusion (Appeal Board 423,145;
Interpretation Service Index 1610.11). We now reject the latter ruling, and its
unwarranted conclusion that a worker who is denied coverage by one insurer is
thereby rendered uninsurable. In an insurance market that includes assigned
risk pools and apportioned liability, no licensed driver is uninsurable.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>At the same time, we do not seek to
minimize the inconvenience to the instant employer in having to find an
alternate insurer and incur the likely expense of increased premiums. We note
the contention of the employer, on appeal by the Commissioner, that it
reprimanded the claimant, nearly a year prior to his discharge, about his record
of driving citations and parking violations, and their negative affect on his
license and the employer’s insurance premiums. For this reason, we conclude
that the matter should be referred to the local office for consideration and
determination of the alternate issue of whether the claimant’s behavior,
following the employer’s alleged warning, rose to the level of misconduct under
the law.</span></p>

a meat counterman, was employed three days of each week at a salary of $30 per
week. He was laid off because of a lack of work and filed an original claim for
benefits, effective May 21, 1956. He was held to be eligible to receive
benefits at the rate of $36 per week, based upon information from his former
employer that he worked at least 26 weeks and earned at least $3640 during his
base period.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

claimant with 47 weeks of employment and earnings of $1410 during his base
period, resulting in a revised benefit rate of $19 per week. When claimant
began to receive weekly benefit checks in the sum of $36 he thought it strange,
in view of the fact that he had only earned $30 per week while he was employed.
He discussed the matter with his former employer who felt likewise. Claimant
did not bring the matter to the attention of the local office or make any
inquiry thereafter with respect to the amount of his benefit checks. At the
time he filed his claim for benefits, claimant received an information booklet

determination, there is a decrease or denial of benefits, which decrease or
denial is based upon a retroactive payment of remuneration, any excess benefits
paid under the original initial determination is a recoverable overpayment. The
question of good faith or lack thereof is not controlling therein. In view of
claimant's own testimony that she received holiday pay subsequent to her return
to work, it follows that the money received by claimant was retroactive
remuneration. Any benefits paid to her for such period are therefore
recoverable.</span></p>

aged 23, worked as a telephone operator at a university from July, 1974 through
February 26, 1975 and again from June 23, 1975 through November 14, 1975, when
he lost his job under non-disqualifying conditions. He filed an original claim
for benefits effective May 24, 1976, establishing a base period of May 26, 1975
through May 23, 1976. He was requested by the local office to furnish
information concerning his earnings during the base period. Claimant reported that
he earned $2,694.83 during the period. Claimant had earned only $1,641.40.
Based on his reported earnings of $2,694.83, claimant's benefit rate was
established at $64 per week. He collected benefits at this rate through April
24, 1977. Based on his true earnings of $1,641.40, his benefit rate should have
been $41. Because he received benefits at a higher rate than that to which he
was entitled, claimant was overpaid $983.25 in benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;The
evidence establishes that claimant earned $1,641.40 during his base period, but
that he reported earnings of $2,694.83 and, as a result, was overpaid $983.25
in benefits. Benefits which are overpaid as a result of a false statement are
recoverable pursuant to Section 597.4 of the Law. The false statement need not
have been deliberately or&nbsp;wilfully&nbsp;made (Appeal Board #228,122). It
is, therefore, not material that claimant believed he was furnishing the
correct information and received the benefits in good faith. Accordingly, we
conclude that the overpayment of $983.25 in benefits is recoverable.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimant
filed an original claim for benefits effective July 4, 1983. By initial
determination effective April 25, 1983 she was disqualified because of
voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. That determination was
issued prior to the claimant's having received any benefit payments. She
requested a hearing and as a result of said hearing received a decision
overruling the initial determination issued by an administrative law judge on
September 7, 1983. By virtue of the judge's decision, the claimant was
thereafter paid $602 in benefits. The judge's decision was eventually reversed
and the initial determination sustained on March 15, 1984 in Appeal Board
#349,892. In regard to the benefits which claimant received, $448 were for
statutory weeks ending July 17 through September 4, 1983 and the remaining $154
were for statutory weeks ending September 11 through September 25, 1983.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: There is
no dispute that claimant received all of the benefit payment in question.
Further, all of these benefits represent an overpayment in view of the fact
that the initial determination disqualifying claimant was sustained by the
Appeal Board in Appeal Board #349,892. However, we disagree with the judge's
conclusion that since the actual payment of benefits was made to the claimant
on or after September 5, 1983 that&nbsp;<u>all</u>&nbsp;the benefits are
recoverable. We conclude that the effective date of September 5, 1983,
established by Chapter 415 of the Laws of 1983, Sections 9 and 26 pertain to
the statutory weeks of entitlement and not to the check release or payment
date. To construe that all payments are recoverable based merely on the
fortuity of a check release date fails to recognize the fact that many
determinations, decisions and benefit payments are substantially delayed
because of protracted litigation and clerical or administrative inefficiency
when the original periods of entitlement in issue may have far predated
September 5. We see no legislative intent to reach back and upset such cases,
or to reach such an inequitable result. The Board concludes that there is no
statutory authority for the recoverability of those benefits paid for the
statutory weeks ending prior to September 5, 1983. We have so held in the past
(Appeal Board #351,675).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant, a union member, was employed as a probationary police officer for
this municipal employer from June 30, 1995 through July 21, 1997. On May 8,
1997, the claimant (along with other probationary officers) was called to
provide hair samples for his end-of-probation drug test. On this date, the
claimant completed the Medical History End-of-Probation questionnaire, in which
he identified various medications he took during the past three months. Also, a
police officer took three samples of claimant’s head hair, approximately 60
strands per sample. The first and the second (safety net) samples were sent to
the laboratory, used by the employer, for drug testing. The third (reserve)
sample was kept by the employer. Another police officer, a sergeant, verified
and otherwise supervised the collection of the hair samples and their shipment
to a private outside laboratory that specializes in drug testing.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Initially, the laboratory places
hair samples on the internal chain of custody form. Thereafter, a portion (or
an&nbsp;alloquat) of a sample to be tested undergoes a washing procedure.
The&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;is first washed with isopropyl alcohol in an isolating
water bath, which moves the hair back and forth 100 times per minute for 15
minutes. After removing the alcohol-water solution, the&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;of
hair undergoes three separate phosphate buffer washes, each buffer wash at 100
cycles per minute lasting for 30 minutes. The wash cycles are performed to
eliminate contamination from external sources.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The laboratory utilizes&nbsp;Radiommunoassay&nbsp;(RIA)
and Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to detect ingested illegal drug
(drugs of abuse) in fair samples. The RIA and the GC/MS have been developed
since the 1960’s and the 1950’s, respectively, and it has been long accepted by
the scientific community as sound techniques. The RIA is used as a preliminary
(screening) test and the GC/MS is considered the standard confirmatory (main)
test to detect drugs of abuse. A negative RIA test result is reported negative
and no confirmatory GC/MS test is performed. If the test result is positive
under RIA, then the GC/MS test is used to confirm the positive result. All the
laboratory technicians have Bachelor of Science degrees, and a number of them
working with GC/MS have Ph.D. degrees.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The laboratory received the two
hair samples from the employer on May 9, 1997. After completing the internal
chain of custody form, an&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;of the first sample under went the
wash routine. Then the&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;was tested for the detection of five
drugs of abuse, which resulted in a positive finding of cocaine use. The
laboratory repeated its washes and tests using another&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;from
the first sample and conformed its positive result. The laboratory performed a
third set of washes and tests using an&nbsp;alloquat&nbsp;from the safety net
sample which reconfirmed the positive finding for cocaine use.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Throughout the testing process from
May 9 through May 24, 1999, the laboratory staff followed all internal chain of
custody and other security measures. On June 10, 1997, the positive test
results were reviewed and confirmed by the laboratory’s safety net committee,
which included the quality assurance director. Based on the positive drug test,
the employer suspended the claimant from employment on June 10, 1997 and later
terminated his employment on June 21, 1997.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The employer’s expert witness,
having a Ph.D. and who was the vice president of laboratory operations at the
laboratory, testified that both he and the laboratory were certified by the New
York State Department of Health to perform tests to detect drugs of abuse on
various body hair samples, including head and underarm hair. The witness has
been a member of various societies, including the Society of Forensic
Toxicology (SOFT). He had testified in numerous civilian and military cases
regarding hair testing for drug use. In the professional opinion of the
employer’s expert witness, RIA and GC/MS techniques to detect drug abuse are
sound; his laboratory staff carefully following the established testing
procedures and techniques; and the claimant’s hair samples tested positive for
cocaine use a direct result of cocaine ingestion.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On August 8, 1997, the claimant, on
his own initiative, had a sample of his underarm hair taken for cocaine testing
at a different laboratory. By report dated August 19, 1997, this laboratory
detected no cocaine use. At any given time, approximately 50 percent of
underarm hair and approximately 10 percent of head hair is dormant. During the
non-growth period, the dormant hair does not accumulate any drugs of abuse
ingested by the individual. The director of laboratory operations at this
laboratory testified that there may not have been &quot;enough drug use to
cause the underarm hair to be positive&quot;, but that there could have been &quot;enough
drug use to cause the head hair to be positive.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant’s expert witness, the
Chief Toxicologist for the Nassau County Medical Examiner’s office, is also a
member of SOFT. He has performed various drug tests, but has not performed any
drug tests using body hair. He testified, in his professional opinion, that RIA
hair testing, without proper control and ensuring no external contamination, is
not reliable.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
evidence establishes that the hair testing utilized by the outside laboratory
utilized by the employer to detect drug use is reliable. In United States v.
Medina, 749 F Supp 59 (ED New York 1990), the Court laid out three criteria
under which hair analysis test results should be accepted: (1) the hair sample
was properly obtained; (2) the laboratory technique used was sound; and (3) the
laboratory was careful and accurate in its use of that technique.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Here, the claimant’s hair samples
were obtained under the supervision of a sergeant and then sent to the
laboratory. Regardless, the claimant does not dispute the chain of custody of
his hair sample. Also, the laboratory washed the hair samples three times to
remove any external contamination. Furthermore, the employer’s expert witness
produced sufficient evidence that the laboratory techniques used were sound and
that these techniques were carefully followed to obtain the claimant’s positive
test result for cocaine use. The laboratory not only performed a RIA, but it
also found a positive result using the established GC/MS technique.
Accordingly, we hold that the hair testing to detect drugs at the laboratory
utilized by the employer is reliable and hold valid the positive test results.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although the claimant contends, and
the Administrative Law Judge held, that hair testing is not reliable, we note
that the record fails to establish such finding. The claimant’s expert witness
did not testify that hair testing is not reliable. Rather, he merely stated
that hair testing may be reliable if certain precautions are taken, including
the removal of external contamination. Here, the record establishes that all
control precautions were taken and that any possible external contamination was
removed. We also note that the record does not support the Judge’s holding that
certain societies had rejected hair testing as unreliable.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Alternatively, the claimant wishes
the Board to rely on hair testing to prove that he did not ingest cocaine based
on the negative underarm test result. We do not find such subsequent test
result to be controlling. Here, the claimant’s witness provided evidence that a
negative cocaine test result on the claimant’s underarm hair is not inconsistent
with a positive cocaine test result on the claimant’s head hair because of the
different dormancy periods between the two types of hair.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We note that the Appellate
Division, First Department, has upheld hair testing in a similar case involving
a probationary police officer who was terminated after failing a similar hair
test for drug use. See, In re Brown, __AD2d__ (May 28, 1990). Under the entire
circumstances of this case, we conclude that the evidence establishes that the
claimant ingested cocaine during his probationary employment as a police
officer. Therefore, he was properly disqualified from receiving benefits
because he lost his employment due to misconduct.</span></p>

claimant earned a total of $5,601 following her last separation from employment
with the objecting employer. As the claimant earned remuneration well in excess
of $550, the amount she would need to break a disqualification, we conclude
that she has broken any potential disqualification which might have existed as
a result of her separation from employment with the objecting employer and is
now deemed eligible for benefits.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>As to the employer's contention
that its account should not be charged for benefits paid to the claimant, Labor
Law Section 581.1(e) provides that an employer's account shall not be charged
for benefits paid to a claimant &quot;after the expiration of a period of
disqualification from benefits following a final determination that the
claimant lost employment with the employer through misconduct or voluntary
separation of employment without good cause.&quot; However, the claimant never
filed a claim for benefits following her separation from employment with the
objecting employer, hence no such determination was ever made. Therefore, no
basis exists for relieving the objecting employer from being charged.
Accordingly, we conclude that the employer's objection was properly overruled.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant worked as a secretary for a communications firm for approximately
seven years, until October 25, 1996. In October of 1995, the claimant’s
husband, who had extensive work experience in management for a fast food chain,
was offered a job in that field in&nbsp;Nevada. He accepted the job offer in
December of 1995 and relocated to&nbsp;Nevada&nbsp;in February of 1996 to
commence working on a trial basis. The claimant retained her job and remained
in&nbsp;New York&nbsp;with their children, because she wanted to be sure that
her husband's new job would work out before relocating the family
to&nbsp;Nevada. In June of 1996 the claimant's husband and his new employer
expressed mutual satisfaction with his continued employment. At that point, the
claimant and her husband determined to relocate their family to&nbsp;Nevada, at
which time they put their house up for sale. A buyer was subsequently found and
the closing took place on October 31, 1996. The claimant thereupon separated
from her employment and, on November 2, 1996 moved to&nbsp;Nevada&nbsp;with her
children and reunited with her husband.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: In our
original decision, we concluded that the claimant had failed to demonstrate a
compelling reason for having waited four months after her husband had relocated
to&nbsp;Nevada&nbsp;and commenced employment before determining to move there
with her children. Upon reconsideration, we now disagree with that conclusion.
The credible evidence establishes that the claimant quit her job for a valid
reason namely, to join her husband in&nbsp;Nevada, where he had secured
employment. We further conclude that it was not unreasonable for her to have
waited until June of 1996, at which time it first became certain that her
husband’s continued employment in his new job was assured, before making the
final decision to sell their house and move the rest of the family to join him.
Accordingly and in view of all of these circumstances, we now conclude that the
claimant left her job for a compelling reason and with good cause under the
law.</span></p>

     started. The claimant’s spouse had accepted this job on a trial basis in
     February. It was not until June that the claimant’s spouse and the
     spouse’s employer expressed mutual satisfaction with the employment. At
     that point, the claimant’s preparation for relocation began: it was at
     that point that the family home was offered for sale.</span></li>

     finding regarding the reasons for any delay in relocation to follow a
     spouse must identify not only the reasons for the delay, but also the
     timing of the decisions and the steps taken in the process. If the
     spouse’s job is on a trial basis, or a probation must be completed, then a
     delay until the job is secure is reasonable. If, on the contrary, a
     contract of hire is unconditional, then no delay is needed to ascertain
     that the job is secure.</span></li>

claimant was employed by the employer herein, a security agency, as a security
guard on two occasions, the last of which ended on April 29, 2000, under
conditions not at issue here. In November 2000, the employer was notified by
the Department of Labor that the claimant had applied for unemployment
insurance benefits. On November 22, the employer mailed a letter to the
claimant offering him full time work as a security guard at the current prevailing
wage and advising the claimant to immediately report to the personnel
department for assignment. The claimant signed acknowledging receipt of the
letter on November 24. The claimant did not contact the employer concerning the
offer of employment. The employer had a full time position as a security guard
immediately available for the claimant at the prevailing wage of $7.84 per
hour.</span></p>

credible evidence establishes that the claimant failed to respond to an offer
of employment made by a former employer for the same type of position in which
the claimant had previously worked. Although the offer of employment may not
have included details such as to the specific hours and location of the
assignment or the specific wage, the offer clearly put the claimant on notice
that immediate, full time work was available as a security guard at the
prevailing wage. The claimant's failure to respond to the offer forestalled the
employer from providing further information concerning the proffered employment
and was tantamount to a refusal of employment under the Unemployment Insurance
Law. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant refused an offer of employment
without good cause and is, therefore, disqualified from receipt of benefits.</span></p>

     to obtain the precise prevailing rate, he simply stated in the letter that
     he would pay the claimant the prevailing rate. Therefore the job offer
     satisfied the statutory threshold in that it offered a wage which was not
     substantially below the prevailing wage. In similar cases additional fact
     finding regarding suitability, prevailing wage, or other factors might be

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant worked as a service desk clerk for the employer since December 28,
1994. The claimant worked an average of four to five days a week until January,
2001. At about this time, the claimant enrolled in a program to do student
teaching. The claimant spent at least 40 hours a week doing such student
teaching, preparing lesson plans and doing grading. The claimant and other
enrollees were advised by the administrator of this school program to quit all
employment. The claimant also enrolled in at least one additional college
course. Therefore, the claimant had the employer change her work schedule to
one day a week. Continuing work had been available four to five days a week. On
about March 12, 2001,the claimant filed a claim for unemployment insurance
benefits. The claimant resumed her four to five days a week work schedule
shortly before the date of the hearing held on June 7, 2001.</span></p>

before the Board is whether the claimant's decision to unilaterally reduce her
four to five days a week work schedule to one day a week constituted a
voluntary separation without good cause. Significantly, the claimant had
enrolled in a full time school program of at least forty hours a week and had
taken at least one additional college course, so that she no longer was
available to work her regular four to five days a week schedule. In effect, the
claimant had severed her preexisting employment relationship to create a
substantial reduction in the terms and conditions of her regular employment
relationship. Furthermore, continuing work, four to five days a week, was
available.</span></p>

had been allowed to continue working one day a week. Considering the totality

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On February 2, 2001, the claimant
was contacted by an employment agency from which he had previously obtained
work at certain financial institutions. He was offered a long-term position as
a turret telephone operator at a financial institution. The position involved
forwarding calls to the financial institution’s traders on the trading floor
and it paid $16.00 per hour. The claimant declined the offered position because
he was seeking a position which paid $20.00 per hour. The claimant had
previously accepted a similar position from the employment agency.</span></p>

maintains statistics on the prevailing wage for different job classifications,
includes the job offered to the claimant in the classification of Brokerage
Clerk. The prevailing wage for this classification is $16.78 per hour, and the
prevailing wage cut-off is $15.10 per hour.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Pursuant
to Paragraph 9 of the Consent Judgment entered into in MLC v&nbsp;Sitkin&nbsp;and
subsequent stipulations, the Department of Labor is obligated to promulgate and
enforce procedures which will ensure that claimants are made aware of the
requirements necessary to maintain their eligibility for benefits. This
includes providing information regarding what wages a claimant is required to
accept on offers of employment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Upon further consideration of the
facts in this case, we hold that our prior decision was in error and that the
claimant was provided with the necessary information. Our prior decision did
not distinguish between jobs which are referred to the claimant by the
Department of Labor and jobs which are offered directly to the claimant by an
employer. When the job is referred to the claimant by the Department, the
claimant must be advised of the prevailing wage if the claimant declines a
referral because of dissatisfaction with the wages before the claimant can be
disqualified by reason of the refusal. However, when the job is offered
directly to the claimant by an employer, the burden is on the claimant to
contact the Department to obtain prevailing wage information if the claimant
has been properly advised to do so. The evidence in this case establishes that
the claimant was advised, through the medium of the information handbook, that
he was required to accept jobs which paid the prevailing wage and that prevailing
wage information for a particular occupation could be obtained at
the&nbsp;Community&nbsp;Service&nbsp;Center. The claimant received the handbook
and is charged with constructive knowledge of its contents, regardless of
whether he actually read the entire handbook.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant was offered a suitable
job which paid more than the prevailing wage cut-off and his preference for a
higher wage does not provide him with good cause to refuse the offer. It was
the claimant’s responsibility to contact the Department of Labor to ascertain
whether the job met the prevailing wage standard and his failure to do so does
not excuse him from accepting the offer. As the claimant refused an offer
without good cause, he was properly disqualified from benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the benefits he received constitute an overpayment. As he certified that he had
not refused an offer of employment, the overpayment is recoverable. Further, as
his&nbsp;wilful&nbsp;misrepresentation, sustained in our prior decision,
resulted in the overpayment of benefits, the appropriate forfeit penalty is
eight effective days.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant last worked on June 30, 2000 for employer DR. After his employment
with DR ended, the claimant filed a claim for benefits effective July 31, 2000.
The claimant was held eligible to receive benefits, and thereafter received 26
weeks of unemployment benefits. Still without work and with medical bills to
pay, the claimant filed another claim for benefits effective August 6, 2001.
The claimant reported his employment with DR and that he last worked on June
30, 2000. The Department processed the claimant's claim. Through some error,
the claimant was credited with having worked for employer TSE during the second
quarter of 2001, earning $5,058.76 and with having worked for employer DR
during the first quarter of 2001, earning $2,917.82. Claimant did not work for
employer TSE and did not work for employer DR from June 30, 2000 through August
6, 2001. Based on the error crediting claimant with work he did not have, the
Department set claimant's weekly benefit rate at $194. A determination dated
August 22, 2001 was sent to the claimant notifying him of his benefit rate. The
determination indicated that the benefit was based on claimant's employment and
earnings with DR and TSE. The claimant received his determination and noted
that the employer TSE was listed on the determination, but he did not report to
the Department that he had not worked for employer TSE. The claimant was held
eligible to receive benefits, and received $1,552 in benefits before his claim
was&nbsp;redetermined.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the claimant did not have any employment
from the time he filed his claim on July 31, 2000 through the time he filed his
subsequent claim on August 6, 2001. Without employment during this period, the
claimant cannot file a valid original claim effective August 6, 2001 pursuant
to Section 527.6 of the Labor Law because to file a subsequent claim the
claimant must establish that he worked and received remuneration worth five
times his benefit rate during the period between the two claims. Accordingly,
we conclude that the claimant was not entitled to the $1,552 in benefits he
received. Further, we conclude that such overpayment is recoverable because the
claimant upon receiving the determination listing TSE as one of his employers
concealed from the department the fact that he had not worked for TSE. The
claimant had an obligation to bring such an obvious mistake to the attention of
the Department.</span></p>

November 2000 the claimant and his girlfriend purchased the domain name of

site, totaling $1,200. The web site displayed items for sale. Each day the claimant
would check his e-mail to see if there was an e-mail prompt to check the site.
This arose out of activity on the web site. If a customer purchased an item,
the claimant would contact the wholesaler and arrange to have the item shipped
to the customer. He would pay the wholesaler. In May 2002, the claimant closed
the site. During its operation, there were five sales totaling about $141.75.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant filed a claim for benefits effective April 21, 2003. She applied for
approval of training pursuant to Labor Law Section 599 in order to increase her
knowledge about computer applications. On June 12, 2003, she commenced
training. She reported to a facility approximately three hours a day, generally
five days per week. If she was unable to appear on a certain day, she would
make up the time. The training is self-paced. At the facility, she had a
textbook and a computer that plays a CD that has an instructor explaining a
certain lesson. There is no instructor at the facility to answer questions
about the material. If the claimant had any questions, she reviewed the material.
At the conclusion of the lesson, an administrative staff person at the facility
provides the claimant with a test that she takes to demonstrate her knowledge
of the material. The claimant also does her job search at the facility.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Section
482.2 of the Department of Labor’s regulations promulgated under Labor Law
Section 599 defines an approved training course, in part, as being one which
has a defined curriculum of appropriate duration to impact the intended skills
and knowledge, and is taught by competent instructors.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence establishes
that the training program in which the claimant was a participant did not meet
the criteria set forth in the regulations. Significantly, the program is
self-paced and the claimant could determine the hours of the program. Moreover,
no instructors were available at the facility to answer questions about the
material. She only received instructions contained in the CD. She also
performed her work search at the facility. The Board has held that time spent
in a computer center that was not scheduled, supervised, nor had a minimal time
requirement, did not meet the criteria of the Commissioner’s regulations (See
A.B. No. 447,576). Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant was properly
denied benefits pursuant to Labor Law Section 599.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant worked as a Technical Support Representative for the employer herein
for one year. She has been in a relationship with a domestic partner for four
and a half years, as of the date she filed for unemployment insurance benefits.
The claimant had previously moved with her partner in November 1999, when they
relocated to&nbsp;Rochester&nbsp;from&nbsp;California. The claimant and her
partner live a life of mutual emotional and financial interdependence, sharing
household chores and living expenses, and commingling finances. The claimant
and her partner have co-owned two homes. They share bank and money market accounts,
and an ATM/Visa card. They have registered as domestic partners with the
claimant’s partner’s employer and the claimant has been and continues to be
covered by her partner’s employer health insurance. The claimant and her
partner are beneficiaries on each other’s life insurance, they have prepared
wills naming each other as beneficiaries, and have executed documents granting
each other power of attorney and power to make health care decisions for the
other. The claimant and her partner hold themselves out to be a committed
monogamous couple.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant’s partner was offered
a job in the state of&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;and, in November 2000, she accepted
the definite offer of employment as an Information Technology Project Manager
with a large banking institution. At that time the claimant submitted her
resignation to her employer in order to move with her partner to&nbsp;Virginia.
Her last day of work was November 29, 2000. The claimant and her partner moved
to&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;on or about December 2, 2000. The claimant’s partner
started her new job on December 4, 2000.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Section
501 of the New York State Labor Law sets forth the legislative policy
underlying the state’s unemployment compensation system. It provides financial
support to workers who are unemployed &quot;through no fault of their
own&quot;, recognizing that involuntary unemployment is &quot;a subject of
general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the
legislature to . . . lighten its burden, which now so often falls with crushing
force upon the unemployed worker.&quot; The statute provides that persons who
voluntarily separate form employment without good cause shall not be eligible
for benefits (Section 593 (1)(a).) Since the inception of the&nbsp;New
York&nbsp;State&nbsp;unemployment law, there has been no statutory definition
of what constitutes &quot;good cause&quot;. The broad and indefinite language
of the statute indicates that the legislature sought to provide standards
flexible enough to insure effective application of legislative policy to
changing circumstances. Although, in the past, the Board has previously found
good cause to exist in similar cases only when the claimant was relocating with
a spouse who secured a definite offer of employment in another location, we now
hold that the presumption that attaches to marital status is not the exclusive
means of demonstrating &quot;good cause&quot; to leave one’s employment to move
to a new area. We now conclude that it is unfair to deny a&nbsp;nonmarital&nbsp;partner
the right to prove, without benefit of the marital presumption, that his or her
reasons for leaving employment were also with good cause.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence establishes
that the claimant quit her employment in order to move with her domestic
partner, who accepted and started a new job in the state of&nbsp;Virginia, with
the intention to preserve their partnership. The credible evidence further
establishes that the claimant and her partner demonstrably maintain an
emotionally and financially interdependent committed relationship. Though no
single factor is solely determinative, as it is the totality of the
relationship which should control, it is significant that the claimant has
established that she and her partner have an exclusive and long term
relationship, co-own property, maintain joint bank an credit accounts, share
household chores and duties, have named each other as beneficiaries on
insurance policies and wills, have registered as domestic partner, and hold
themselves out as a committed couple. Under these circumstances, it would be
good cause to quit one’s job to move with one’s partner in order to maintain
their relationship when it is shown that the partner had good cause to move in
the first instance. As the definite offer of a job in&nbsp;Virginia&nbsp;gave
the claimant’s partner good cause to move, the claimant had good cause to resign
from her own job to relocate with her partner. Accordingly, we conclude that
the claimant voluntarily left her employment with good cause. The claimant is,
therefore, not subject to the disqualification imposed.</span></p>

good work record.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to her husband’s escalating verbal
and mental abuse, claimant, who was pregnant and suffering from poor weight
gain and sleeplessness, resigned from her employment and relocated with her
five-year-old son to a domestic violence shelter, a decision supported by
claimant’s obstetrician. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board ruled that
claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits because
she voluntarily left her employment without good cause. Claimant appeals,
arguing that the proof shows that her resignation was for good

Board’s decision denying the claimant is not supported by substantial evidence

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The claimant was employed as an
administrative assistant at an accounting firm for just over two years, until
October 28, 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first week of October 2005 the claimant
saw her ex-husband standing by the train station near her place of
employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;When married to him for the period from 1987 to 1995,
the claimant was the victim of domestic violence, including his knocking out
her teeth, burning her, and throwing her down a flight of stairs. Her children
were also subjected to his abuse. The husband had also attempted to kidnap
their daughter. In 1995 the claimant divorced her husband and moved
to&nbsp;Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1995 to 2005, there were no incidents
involving her ex-husband, as he did not know where she lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
claimant moved back to&nbsp;New York&nbsp;in October 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;When her
ex-husband found out where she was living, she moved to&nbsp;Jersey City.
Shortly thereafter she discovered that the ex-husband was also living
in&nbsp;New Jersey, so in April 2004 the claimant moved to&nbsp;Brooklyn. The
claimant had not seen her ex-husband for some time until that first incident in
October 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 12, 2005 the claimant again observed him
near her place of employment, as well as outside her place of
residence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant asked for a week off from work and went
to&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;hoping that her ex-husband would think that she did not
live in&nbsp;New York. She returned to&nbsp;New York&nbsp;and again observed
him lingering near her place of employment, as well as outside of her place of
residence. The claimant called her local police station, but the police told
her that there was nothing that they could do until her ex-husband engaged in
an overt act.&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to alter her work schedule, coming in
earlier and leaving earlier, but she still observed her ex-husband in the
vicinity of her employment, watching her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She made the decision to
resign from her employment and relocate for her safety and that of her children.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
moved to&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;in November 2005.</span></p>

voluntarily resigned from her position because she was being stalked by her
ex-husband, by whose hand she had been the victim of domestic violence. The
claimant made every attempt to avoid contact with him, moving twice after her
return to&nbsp;New York, notifying the police of his malingering, and altering
her work schedule, to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her ex-husband was repeatedly found
to be lurking both at her place of residence and at her place of
employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In an effort to secure her safety as well as the safety
of her children, the claimant chose to resign and move out of state. Before
doing so, the claimant took action on several levels in an effort to preserve
her employment, to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aforementioned circumstances
clearly establish that the claimant had a compelling reason to resign from her
employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant was separated
from her employment under non-disqualifying conditions. The decision of the

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant worked as
a patient care technician at a large medical center in the&nbsp;Bronx, for
approximately six years until March 31, 2004. The clamant and her two children
lived in the&nbsp;Bronx&nbsp;with the claimant’s fiancé and his seventeen year
old son. The claimant’s fiancé had physically assaulted the claimant on at
least one occasion in 2002. On March 3, 2004, the claimant’s fiancé severely
beat his seventeen year old son, which caused the claimant to fear for her own
safety, and for that of her children.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant notified the
police, who arrived at the claimant’s residence, just as the claimant was about
to leave with her children.</span></p>

temporarily, with a friend. The claimant’s ex-fiancé thereafter repeatedly
telephoned the claimant at work, came, in person, at the claimant’s place of
work and issued threats against her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, the
ex–fiancé threatened, on more than one occasion to “choke” the claimant. The
claimant thereupon determined to relocate to the&nbsp;Albany&nbsp;area, in
order to remove herself from what she perceived to be a dangerous
situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;She left her employment as of March 31, 2004 and moved
upstate, with her children, on April 3, 2004.</span></p>

quit her job and moved from New York City to the Albany area, in order to get

occasion, physically assaulted the claimant and had engaged in an ongoing
pattern of harassment and threats against the claimant at the claimant’s place
of work, including specific threats to “choke” the claimant. Upon further
consideration, we now conclude that the claimant’s fear for her personal
safety, as well as for that of her children, was a legitimate one and provided
her with a compelling reason to leave her employment.</span></p>

ex-fiancé.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant’s decision to remove herself from the

information handbook, it was incumbent upon the claimant to read it, and he is

Labor Law does not imply a criminal intent to defraud, but simply means
“knowingly”, “intentionally”, “deliberately” (see&nbsp;<u>Matter of Vick</u>,
12 AD 2d 120).&nbsp; As the claimant knew or should have known from the handbook
that he was not available for employment, his certification on July 26 was
wilfully made.</span></p>

received overpaid benefits as a result of his wilful misrepresentation, the

Appeal from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed
December 1, 2006, which, among other things, ruled that claimant was ineligible
to receive unemployment insurance benefits because she was not totally
unemployed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Claimant filed an application for unemployment insurance benefits effective
December 5, 2005. On February 22, 2006, she formed a corporation for the
purpose of selling vending machines and, in the ensuing weeks, she performed
various tasks in preparation of actually operating the business.&nbsp; She
received benefits totaling $1, 320, with her last check covering the week
ending April 2, 2006. Her certifications for the weeks ending April 9, 2006,
April 16, 2006, April 23, 2006 and April 30, 2006 were held by the Department
of Labor. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board subsequently ruled that, due
to the activities that she performed on behalf of the corporation, claimant was
not totally unemployed and, therefore, was ineligible to receive benefits. The
Board also charged her with a recoverable overpayment pursuant to Labor Law §
597 (4) and reduced her right to receive future benefits by 48 days on the
basis that she made willful misrepresentations to obtain benefits.&nbsp;Claimant
appeals.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Initially, we note that activities performed in connection with starting a new
business have rendered claimants ineligible to receive unemployment insurance
benefits based upon a lack of total unemployment (<u>see e.g.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Donaghy [Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 264 AD2d 883 [1999];&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Murak [Sweeny]</u>, 244 AD2d 751 [1997]).&nbsp; Even where such activities were
minimal, the key factor was whether the claimant stood to benefit financially
from the existence of the business (<u>see</u>&nbsp;<u>Matter of Siegel
[Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 43 AD2d 1224, 1224-1225 [2007]). In the case at
hand, claimant filed a certificate of incorporation, obtained a federal tax
identification number, registered for unemployment insurance withholding,
loaned the corporation money, established a business Web site, placed an order
for business telephone lines and wrote checks from the business checking
account, all while she was receiving unemployment insurance benefits.&nbsp;
Inasmuch as she performed such tasks in furtherance of the business and in
anticipation of obtaining a financial benefit from its operation, substantial
evidence supports the Board’s finding that claimant was not totally unemployed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The record also supports the Board’s imposition of a recoverable overpayment
and forfeiture penalty. &nbsp;Although claimant acknowledged two days when she
was engaged in self-employment activities, she had pursued her new business
before obtaining her federal tax identification number on March 24, 2006 and
continued to certify for benefits for five weeks thereafter.&nbsp; This
evidence, together with proof that claimant was aware that she could have, but
admittedly failed to, read the unemployment insurance handbook available
on-line, where she applied for benefits, is sufficient to establish that she
willfully misrepresented her activities during the time that she was receiving
benefits (<u>see</u>&nbsp;<u>Matter of Bowlby [Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 31
AD2d 939, 940 [2006];&nbsp;<u>Matter of Raspallo [Commissioner of Labor]</u>,
10 AD2d 751, 751-752 [2004]).&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT</span></u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The claimant
worked during the 2007-2008 school year as a substitute teacher for the New
York City Department of Education. The claimant worked 72 days out of the 180
days in a school year. She was paid for 65 days as a per diem substitute, and
the balance as a session substitute. The claimant earned $154.97 a day as a per
diem substitute, and a lesser amount for partial days as a session substitute.
The New York City School Board utilizes a computerized Sub Central registry
system for contacting substitute teachers during the school year. The
claimant’s name is registered in the Sub Central system. The claimant’s
classification is common branch. A teacher or an administrator contacts the Sub
Central registry and indicates the need for a teacher for a certain class. The
registry notifies the listed substitute teacher by order of classification,
location, and whether the teacher is on a preferred or priority list for that
school. The registry may make several offers of employment to a substitute
teacher per day. The claimant was offered 126 days of work during the 2007-2008
school&nbsp;year. The claimant accepted five assignments from the registry and
was administratively assigned three additional assignments, totaling 65 days of
work.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The New York City Department of Education sent the claimant a letter, dated
June 13, 2008, which advised the claimant that her name would be included in
the Sub Central registry for the 2008-2009 school year and that it was expected
that the claimant would be contacted at least as often as in the prior year and
that the terms and conditions of employment would be substantially the same.
The Department of Education does not expect any changes which will affect the
need for substitutes in the 2008-2009 school&nbsp;year.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>:
Reasonable assurance, pursuant to Labor Law Section 590(10), exists when the
employer expresses a good faith willingness to place the claimant’s name on a
list from which substitutes are called to teach and the employer will, in good
faith, consider the possibility of offering per diem work to the claimant and
the economic terms and conditions in the new school year are not expected to be
substantially less favorable than in the prior school year.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is the responsibility of the employer to demonstrate with competent
testimony from knowledgeable witnesses concerning the employer’s personnel
practices in hiring procedures that these basic conditions have been met. In
the case at bar the employer’s witness, the operator for the Sub Central
Registry system, offered competent first-hand testimony as to the inclusion of
the claimant’s name on the registry list and how the registry is operated. The
witness produced the computerized printouts listing the claimant’s name and
classification preferences, as well as a list of calls and offers of work made
to the claimant in the 2007-2008 school&nbsp;year. She also competently
testified that the department expected to hire more per diem substitutes in the
2008-2009 school&nbsp;year&nbsp;because of an increase in enrollment of
children, and increase in the number of teachers employed, and an increased
number of school buildings. The employer has thus established that the claimant
would, in good faith, be considered for per diem work in the 2008-2009
school&nbsp;year.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We now need to examine whether the offer of employment for 2008-2009 will be
substantially the same as that of the 2007-2008 school year. Competent
testimony would need to establish that the terms and conditions for the
2008-2009 school&nbsp;year&nbsp;would be at least 90% of that earned in
2007-2008. The claimant worked 72 days of employment in the prior school year.
The claimant was called by the Sub Central registry to work 126 days during the
prior year. It is not controlling that the claimant did not accept all of her
employment form the registry. It is also not dispositive that the claimant
chose not to obtain the six credit hours needed to renew her certification
before the 2008-2009 school&nbsp;year. The burden is on the employer to
establish the offer of employment was made not that the offer was accepted, and
not that the claimant would choose to renew her certification in time for the
next school year. As the employer offered the claimant more than 90% of the
number of days worked, and as the employer through competent testimony has
established that it intends to offer the claimant employment for at least the
same number of days as in the prior year, there has been a good faith offer of
reasonable assurance. As reasonable assurance is established through the
registry there is no need to consider whether claimant received reasonable
assurance from the individual schools who hired her from their preferred lists.
Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant received reasonable assurance of
continuing, substantially similar employment for the 2008-2009 school&nbsp;year,
effective July 14, 2008.</span></p>

municipal firefighter from April 30, 1997 through January 26, 2005, with a
retirement date of January27, 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a member of a union in
contractual relations with the employer. During his employment, the employer
contributed at least 94 percent of payments to the claimant’s pension.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
earnings from the claimant’s last year of employment affected the value of his
pension.&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant received $4,965 a month from this pension,
which is 90 percent of his pension benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of contract
negotiations between the employer and the union, the claimant received a
$7,436.94 back pay award in four installments spread over the first and second
calendar quarters of 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;This award included money allotted to
2004-2005 and will impact the last year of his earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
claimant did not work for this employer in these quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;At some
point, the employer will finalize the claimant’s pension factoring in this
award. The claimant filed an original claim for benefits on April 18, 2007. His
base period is composed of the four quarters of 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;He

term base period employer is not defined in the Labor Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
the term “employer” is defined to include governmental entities (Labor Law
§512); and “base period” is defined as four completed calendar quarters (Labor
Law §520).&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the term “remuneration” is defined in Labor Law
§517 to include, “every form of compensation for employment paid by an employer
to his employees.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the term “employment” is generally defined
in Labor Law §511 to mean “(a) any service under any contract of employment for
hire, express or implied, written or oral.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we note that in
order to be able to file a valid original claim, a claimant is required, in
part to have “been paid remuneration by employers liable for contributions or
for payments in lieu of contributions under this article, other than employers
from whom the claimant lost employment under conditions which would be
disqualifying pursuant to subdivision three of section five hundred
ninety-three of this article, for&nbsp;<i>employment</i>&nbsp;during at least

made during the base period, it is a base period employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin
our analysis by noting that the employer, perhaps inadvertently, has misquoted
Labor Law §600(7)(a) to state, “the claimant’s employment with or remuneration
from such employer affected his eligibility . . . or increased the amount of
such pension . . .” (See statement p. 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;The statute, actually
states, “the claimant’s employment with, or remuneration from, such
employer&nbsp;<i>after the beginning of the base&nbsp;period&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;affected&nbsp;his
eligibility for, or increased the amount of, such

color:black'>As we read the aforesaid sections of the Labor Law, the thread
running through them is the requirement that a claimant actually render
services and this claimant rendered no services to this employer during the
base period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the term base period employer is undefined in the
Labor Law, we construe it to mean an employer for which the claimant rendered
services during the base period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other reading converts into a
“base period employer” any employer for which a claimant worked many years
ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we note that if the legislature had intended that a
relevant pension plan could be maintained by any employer, as opposed to a base
period employer, the legislature would have stated this.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did
not.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, we hold that this employer is not a base period
employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this, we note that on a fact pattern similar

base period employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See A.B. 538,367, aff’d A.B. 539,615A).</span></p>

insurance benefits on July 3, 2006, and a weekly benefit rate was established.
When claimant was interviewed by a Department of Labor representative in early
August 2006, she indicated that she had applied for her pension from the
employer. Claimant received her first pension check on August 25, 2006,
retroactive to July 1, 2006, and promptly notified the Department. Prior to
that time, claimant had received unemployment insurance benefits in the amount
of $2,430. Because the prorated weekly amount of claimant’s pension exceeded
her weekly benefit rate, the Unemployment insurance Appeal Board reduced
claimant’s weekly benefit rate to zero and charged her with a recoverable
overpayment.&nbsp; Upon reconsideration, the Board adhered to its prior
decision, prompting this appeal by claimant.</span></p>

receiving a pension that is fully funded by her former employer and that the
prorated weekly amount of her pension exceeds her weekly unemployment insurance
benefit rate. Under such circumstances, the Board properly reduced claimant’s
benefit rate to zero (<u>see</u>&nbsp;<u>Matter of Ziegler [Commissioner of

receipt of those benefits to the Department, the conditional payment of
unemployment insurance benefits prior to verification of the details of a
claimant’s pension is subject to review and recovery of an overpayment (see

overpayment even though she was not at fault (<u>see</u>&nbsp;Labor Law § 597

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>1. When the claimant in this case
filed an original claim on 7/03/06, she stated that she had neither applied for
nor was receiving a pension. On 8/06/06 however, she disclosed that she had
applied for a pension, but that she did not know when she would receive it, or
how much it would be. The claimant’s benefits were properly released and she
was advised to inform the Department when the first pension payment was
received. Claimant did so, and as the statute specifically addresses this
factual situation, the proper determinations were issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>2. Section 600.7 (c) states: “If,
at the time benefits are payable, it has not been established that the claimant
will be receiving such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity or other
payment, benefits due shall be paid without a reduction, subject to review
within the period and under the conditions as provided in subdivisions three
and four of section five hundred ninety-seven with respect to retroactive
payment of remuneration”. Sections 597.3 &amp; 597.4, taken together state in
effect that a claimant’s eligibility may be redetermined within six months of a
retroactive payment of remuneration and that any resulting overpayment is
recoverable, provided no decision has been rendered upon the merits of the
case.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>3. Thus, a retroactive pension
payment is handled in the same manner as a retroactive payment of remuneration.
A claimant’s rate may be reduced provided:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>a)&nbsp;there&nbsp;has been no
decision (hearing or appeal) rendered on the merits; and<br>
b) the conditions enumerated in Section 600.7 (a) and (b) have been met; and<br>

retroactive pension payment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

resulting overpayment is recoverable.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>4. Although not applicable to the
above case, it remains true that if a claimant falsely states that he or she
has not applied for or is not receiving a pension such statement is both
factually and willfully false. A wilful false statement gives the Commissioner
the right to review the matter and issue a redetermination with no time
limitation. Both the factually false statement and the wilfully false statement
constitute a basis for the recovery of any overpayment caused by the false
statement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal from a decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed May 23, 2007, which ruled, among
other things, that claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment
insurance benefits because his employment was terminated due to misconduct.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant worked as a residential
counselor in a foster care group home for troubled adolescents. He was placed
on administrative leave pending an investigation after residents expressed
concern over his use of profanity and complained that he drove at excessive
speeds when transporting them to school. Claimant subsequently admitted to
performing both activities in violation of employer’s policies and his
employment was terminated. On his application for unemployment insurance
benefits, however, claimant stated that he was discharged because he was unable
to meet his employer’s performance or production standards and he was initially
awarded benefits. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board subsequently
determined that claimant’s termination for misconduct rendered him ineligible
to receive benefits, charged him with a recoverable overpayment and imposed a
forfeiture penalty as a result of its finding that he made a willful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits.&nbsp;Claimant appeals.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We affirm. Although claimant admits
that he was terminated for misconduct, he asserts that the Board improperly
assessed a recoverable overpayment and maintains that he did not make a willful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits. Here, the on-line application for
unemployment insurance benefits offers five options in response to the question
regarding why an applicant is no longer working for his or her most recent
employer.&nbsp; One option is entitled “discharged/let go” and is applicable
when an employee fails to meet performance standards or does not possess
sufficient qualifications for employment. A second option is entitled “fired”
and is applicable when an employee is terminated for violating a company
policy. At a hearing, claimant acknowledged that he was terminated for
violating his employer’s policies and expressly denied ever being informed that
he was discharged for not meeting performance standards. Despite such an
awareness, he selected the “discharged/let go” option after admittedly
considering the “fired” option. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board’s
findings that claimant made a willful misrepresentation and that he should be
charged with a recoverable overpayment (<u>see</u>&nbsp;Labor Law § 597
[4]:&nbsp;<u>Matter of Strader [Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 49 AD3d 1120, 1121
[2008]). Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Board’s decision.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><u><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>COMMENTS</span></u></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>1. The central fact of this case is
claimant’s awareness of the true reason for his termination. As the Court
pointed out, he knew he was fired for several violations of company policy and
not because of any failure to meet performance or production standards. Thus,
in any case involving possible willful misrepresentation regarding the reason
for separation, the claimant’s knowledge of the reason for discharge must be
established. In those situations where an employer gives a claimant a vague
reason for discharge, or no reason at all, the claimant’s choice of
&nbsp;“discharged/let go” may, under such circumstances, be reasonable,
regardless of whether the claimant was actually fired for some kind of misconduct.
There is no willful misrepresentation unless the claimant knows his or her
statement is false.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>2. The two options referred to by
the Court appear as follows in the on-line application for benefits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<b>Discharged/Let Go:</b><br>
You were discharged because you were unable to meet employer performance or
production standards, or you were unable to meet employer’s qualifications for
the job.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Fired:</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'><br>
You were fired for a violation of company policy, such as absenteeism, theft,
insubordination, drug or alcohol use or a criminal act.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>If a claimant chooses
”Discharged/Let Go”, but had clearly been informed that he or she was
terminated due to a violation of company policy, a determination of willful
misrepresentation is proper. Such a determination would be supported by a copy
of the employer’s handbook, manual, or policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

as a direct support professional for an agency which provides housing for
developmentally disabled adults from September, 2007 until September, 2008. The
claimant lost her employment and filed an original claim for benefits. The
department issued the determination referenced above and mailed those
determinations to the claimant on November 26, 2008. The claimant received the
determinations approximately one week later. The determinations contained a
notice that the claimant could request a hearing no later than 30 days after
the mail date of the determination. The claimant wrote her request for a
hearing on December 31, 2008. The envelope containing the request was
postmarked January 8, 2009 and received by the Department on January 9, 2009.
There is no allegation that the claimant suffers from any mental or physical
disability.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION: Labor Law Section 620(1)
requires that a request for a hearing be made within thirty days of the date of
the determination. The statute provides for an extension of this thirty day
period only upon evidence that the claimant’s physical or mental incapacity
prevented the claimant from making a timely request. The Appeal Board through
its published rules and regulations, as amended, provides that a hearing
request be deemed to have been timely made if the request is postmarked within
thirty days of the receipt of the determination. Absent any proof to the
contrary a determination shall be held to have been mailed on the date recited
on the determination and received five business days after the mailing of the
determination. (see&nbsp;12 NYCRR § 461.1)</span></p>

The mailing date of this determination was November 26, 2008. As claimant has
no date certain for receipt, an additional five business days is added to
designate the date of receipt. The claimant thus is deemed to have received the
determination on December 4, 2008. Thirty days from this date was January 3,
2009. January 3rd was a Saturday. Thus the latest claimant’s request could have
been postmarked was Monday, January 5, 2009. The claimant’s request was
postmarked January 8, 2009. There is no allegation that the claimant has a
mental or physical incapacity that prevented her from making her request in a
timely manner. The claimant’s request was therefore late and we conclude that
her request was untimely. As the claimant’s request was untimely, the
determinations cannot be decided on the merits and must continue in effect.</span></p>

any possible disqualification for misconduct as a result of having earned five
times his or her benefit rate in subsequent employment.</span></p>

color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also observe that Labor Law § 593.4 provides, in pertinent part:&nbsp;&nbsp;“No
days of total unemployment shall be deemed to occur during a period of twelve
months after a claimant loses employment as a result of an act constituting a
felony in connection with such employment…In addition, remuneration paid to the
claimant by the affected employer prior to the claimant’s loss of employment
due to such criminal act may not be utilized for the purpose of establishing
entitlement to a subsequent valid original claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of
this subdivision shall apply even if the employment lost as a result of such
act is not the claimant’s last employment prior to the filing of his or her
claim.”&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the law pertaining to criminal acts reflects
a clear intent to prevent claimants from receiving benefits even if the loss of
employment was from an employer other than the last employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had
the legislature clearly intended such a penalty for misconduct other than acts
constituting a felony, it could have included such language in Labor Law §
593.3 rather than only providing for earning remuneration equal to or greater
than five times the benefit rate as the determinative
factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, there is no reason to interpret § 527 as
contemplating the same penalty that exists in § 593.4 in situations where a
claimant has earned the necessary subsequent remuneration.</span></p>

these principles to the facts of this case, the credible evidence establishes
that the claimant earned more than five times his benefit in subsequent
employment after he was discharged from the employer herein.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the
claimant earned sufficient remuneration to break any potential
disqualification, he may not be disqualified from benefits due to
misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner therefore is not required by statute to
exclude the remuneration earned from the employment in question and a final
determination of the issue of misconduct under these circumstances need not be
made.&nbsp;&nbsp;This interpretation is also rational and reasonable given the
public policy of the State to provide unemployment insurance benefits to
persons who are unemployed through no fault of their own (See Labor Law §
501).&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Commissioner’s position that no final determination on
the issue of misconduct had to be made in this case is not only rational but
also consistent with public policy, the employer’s account was properly charged
pursuant to § 581.1(e) (3).</span></p>

benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that, as of 2009, the claimant had obtained no new
photographic assignments, was not actively soliciting business, and, at best,
was simply making outstanding payments to vendors from a prior
assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;At best, her actions, in making outstanding payments in
2009, constituted de&nbsp;minimus&nbsp;activity on behalf of her former
photography business, which was insufficient to render the claimant employed
for the purposes of establishing eligibility for unemployment insurance
benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Appeal Board Case No. 537836).&nbsp;&nbsp;We further
find that while the claimant may have anticipated including deductions on her
2009 tax return for the costs of this business and/or depreciation on her
equipment, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a tax advantage, without
more, is insufficient to support a finding that the claimant is employed as
contemplated by statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Appeal Board Case No. 537836,
534263).&nbsp;&nbsp;And, we reject the Commissioner of Labor’s contention that
the mere existence of the website rendered the claimant
employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the claimant in the Appeal Board Case No. 518965,
cited by the Commissioner of Labor as dispositive, the claimant herein had not
entertained customer inquiries through the website as of October 2008, and more
significantly, did not employ any individuals to sell products through her
website, nor is there any evidence that the claimant’s website even allowed for
such a possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Appeal Board Case No. 518965).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus,
as the claimant had ceased all operations of her photography business when she
performed no substantial activities on behalf of the business after March 2009,
we conclude that the claimant was totally unemployed and therefore eligible for
unemployment insurance benefits.</span></p>

business. As is stated in FM 1-2003, “The mere existence of a web site that
obviously advertises or promotes the claimant for the purposes of work is not
sufficient evidence that a claimant is active in&nbsp;self-employment,&nbsp;or
even actively seeking self-employment”. Thus, in the absence of evidence of
customer inquiries or the purchase of products through the website, the Board
held the claimant to be totally unemployed.</span></p>

color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT: In November 2007, the claimant was elected to
public office as a municipal official and as of January 1, 2008, took office.
The claimant then lost his full-time employment and filed a claim for
unemployment insurance benefits on January 26, 2009. When the claimant filed
for unemployment insurance benefits, he also telephoned the Department of Labor
to find out how his elected position would affect his benefits. The Department
of Labor's representative advised the claimant that his work as an elected
official would not count as covered employment towards his unemployment and
would not affect his benefits. She also advised him, however, that he needed to
declare all full-time or part-time work when claiming for benefits. The
claimant then received and read the unemployment insurance handbook. The
handbook instructed the claimant to report all work that he performed. The
handbook also instructed him that &quot;any activity that brings in or may
bring in income at any time must be reported.&quot;As a councilman, the
claimant worked at least five days per week, and some Saturdays and Sundays,
two to as much as eight hours per day and was paid for his work. He certified
for unemployment insurance benefits from February 1, 2009, through September8,
2010. On or about February 2010, the claimant attempted to reopen a claim for
unemployment insurance benefits, after being so apprised by the Department of
Labor. In so doing, the Department of Labor ascertained that the claimant had
earnings from the municipality from the first quarter of 2009, through the
third quarter of 2009. The claimant was surprised that his wages as an elected
official had been included in the claimant's base period. The Department of
Labor subsequently notified the claimant, by letter of May 20, 2010, that
&quot;information has been received by the Department of Labor that raises a
question as to whether wages you earned with City of Troy can be used to
establish an unemployment insurance claim.&quot; The letter went on to state
that &quot;benefits may be withheld pending an investigation into this
matter.&quot; The claimant responded to an attached Department of Labor
questionnaire by indicating that he was currently serving as a councilman,
elected in November 2007, and reelected in November 2009.When the claimant
certified for unemployment insurance benefits during the entirety of the
relevant time period and even after his receipt of the Department of Labor's
letter in May 2010, he continued to indicate that he was totally unemployed. He
received regular unemployment insurance benefits from February 4, 2009, through
August 2, 2009, in the amount of $10,125.00 with an additional $550.00 in
Federal Additional Compensation (FAC) benefits. From August 9, 2009, through
August 8, 2010, the claimant then received$21,465.00 in Emergency Unemployment
Compensation (EUC08) benefits, with an additional $975.00 in Federal Additional
Compensation (FAC) benefits. And, he lastly received, from August 9, 2010,
through October 31, 2010, $1,518.75 in regular unemployment compensation
benefits, with an additional $100.00 in Federal Additional Compensation (FAC)
benefits.</span></p>

color:black'>OPINION: As there has been no appeal it is now the law of the case
that the claimant was not totally unemployed while working as a public official
and as a result, was not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits during
that time period. The credible evidence, upon which mutual and respective
cross-examination has been afforded the parties, establishes that the claimant
certified for unemployment insurance benefits from February 4, 2009, through
August 2, 2009, while working and receiving payment as a councilman and
received regular unemployment insurance benefits in the amount of $10,125.00
and an additional $550.00 in Federal Additional Compensation benefits. As the
claimant was not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits while working,
the benefits which he received constitute an overpayment. We note that the
question as to whether the claimant was working requires neither legal acumen
nor a legal conclusion. The question was straightforward as to whether the
claimant was doing work in employment or self-employment. The claimant replied
that he was not working, which was factually false and the overpayments are
recoverable. We find too, that the claimant's certifications to total
unemployment constituted willful misrepresentations. In so concluding, we find
the claimant, when confronted as to whether the Department of Labor's
representative, in January 2009, advised him to certify as to his work, and was
vague and evasive. We note that the claimant had little recall of the precise
conversation and never addressed that point, instead, relying upon the fact
that wages as a public officer were not useable in a claim for benefits. There
is also no evidence, that after January 27, 2009, the claimant sought further
guidance from the Department of Labor as to this matter. Instead, the claimant
preferred to rely upon his own interpretation to justify his failure to reveal
any work in employment or self-employment. (See Appeal Board Case No. 550478)
Thus, we conclude that the claimant made willful misrepresentations in order to
obtain benefits, and a forfeit penalty was properly imposed. The credible
evidence further establishes that the claimant then continued to certify, from
August 9, 2009, through August 8, 2010, to total unemployment while working,
and received Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits in the amount
of$21,465.00, with an additional $975.00 in Federal Additional Compensation
benefits. As per § 4005(b) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act 2008, Title
IV, however, each state must be required to seek repayment from any individual
who has received any overpayment of Emergency Unemployment Compensation
benefits and the Federal Additional Compensation benefits that rode along with
such benefits. Hence, as a matter of law, the overpayment received by the
claimant from August 9, 2009, through August 8,2010, is automatically repayable
and the claimant was therefore overpaid $21,645.00 in Emergency Unemployment
Compensation and $975.00 in Federal Additional Compensation benefits. We note
too that during this same time period, the claimant knew that he was doing work
in employment, and was, in fact, getting paid for this work. Thus, the
claimant, in certifying to the contrary, made willful misrepresentations to
obtain benefits, and we further conclude that the forfeit penalty was properly
imposed. The credible evidence lastly establishes that the claimant then
certified to total unemployment, from August 9, 2010, through October 3, 2010,
while working and receiving payment as a councilman and received $1518.75 in
regular benefits with an additional $100.00 in Federal Additional Compensation
Benefits. As the claimant was not eligible for benefits while working, the
unemployment insurance benefits which the claimant received constitute an
overpayment. The claimant's statements to the Department of Labor, that he was
not working, when, in fact, he was working, were factually false and render the
overpayments recoverable. We find it significant, that even when the claimant
attempted to open a new claim for unemployment insurance benefits in February
2010, there is no evidence that the claimant ever sought to clarify the
propriety of his certifications. We find it significant, too, that the claimant
never wavered from his certification of no work. Much like the claimant in
Matter of Small, a self-employed attorney who had told the Department of Labor
of her business but had failed to certify accurately, the claimant too, had
failed to certify to any work in his employment. In that case, the Appellate
Division had determined that regardless of the Department's knowledge of her
business, the claimant, in certifying to total unemployment while working, made
willful misrepresentations to obtain benefits. (Matter of Small, 23 Ad3d873 (3d
Dep't 2005), cf. Matter of&nbsp;Todino, 59 Ad2d 638 (3d Dep't 1977).
Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant's certifications to total
unemployment, while working as a paid public officer, constituted willful
misrepresentations and accordingly, the forfeit penalties were properly imposed.</span></p>

Monday through Thursday from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. and was paid $7.25 to $8 per
hour plus commission. The claimant received a W-2 from her part-time employer
for $2,608 for 2009. The claimant also had a full-time job as a bank teller
that was located four miles from her part-time job. The claimant commuted to

monthly living expenses greatly exceeded the part-time earnings. We further
note that her retention of the part-time job of four days per week, under

the sudden loss of employment due to no fault of the claimant.</span></p>

color:black'>The Legislature has made several changes in the statute relating
to good cause for voluntary leaving of employment demonstrating its recognition
of causes for leaving employment similar to that of the claimant in this case.
These amendments to the law have allowed for eligibility, without disqualifying
conditions, for those claimants who have separated from work due to any
compelling family reasons such as but not limited to domestic violence, illness
or disability of a member of the individual's immediate family, the need to
accompany such individual's spouse to a place from which it is impractical for
such individual to commute and due to a change in the location of the spouse's
employment. See Labor Law Sections 593.1b. Significantly, the United States
Congress has enacted provisions for states to receive additional funding for
administration of unemployment insurance programs conditioned upon enactment of
the amendments described above. See American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (Public Law 11-5).</span></p>

circumstances develop in the course of employment that would have justified the
claimant in refusing such employment in the first instance, such as an increase
in commuting distance, an unreasonable unreimbursed commuting expense, or a
decrease in wages to a level substantially less favorable than those prevailing
in the locality, there is good cause to voluntarily leave such employment. See
Labor Law Section 593.1a.</span></p>

Scranton</u>, 12 NY2d 983 the Court of Appeals held that there is good cause
for a claimant to refuse an offer of a part-time job because the earnings in
that position would be lower than that claimant's benefit rate. In Appeal Board
No. 409186, we held that a claimant had good cause to quit a part-time job when
retention of that employment would have required the claimant to dedicate an
unreasonable amount of her earnings to pay for travel expenses. In Appeal Board
No.355494, we recognized that reduction in earnings to a level such &quot;that
she could not maintain herself under accepted standards of decency&quot;
constituted good cause.</span></p>

common for workers to concurrently hold multiple jobs. We are also mindful of
the Court's decision 32 years ago in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Grandy</u>, 64 AD2d 796
in which it held that a claimant who left part-time employment after being
advised by Department of Labor staff that unemployment insurance benefits could
not be utilized to subsidize loss of earning capacity after loss of a full-time
job, was properly disqualified for voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause from the part-time job. In its opinion, the Court also stated that
unemployment insurance is not a minimum wage substitute and that any change in
the meaning of total unemployment must be accomplished by legislative means. We
find the facts of Grandy distinguishable from the facts of this case because
the claimant's decision to leave the part time employment, here, was caused by
financial hardship.</span></p>

of the claimant in the case at hand as a minimum wage substitute but rather as
an answer to her financial hardship. Also significantly, unlike Grandy, the
claimant in this case did not express a desire to collect unemployment
insurance. Having lost full-time employment through no fault of her own and in
the absence of eligibility for any partial benefits, the claimant's decision to
leave the part-time job and seek the unemployment insurance benefit rate of$305
was motivated by financial hardship. We find that her leaving the part-time job
under these circumstances was a reasonable response to her hardship and was
through no fault of her own. In view of all of the foregoing, we find that the
claimant had good cause under the law to voluntarily leave her part-time
employment.</span></p>

color:black'>DISSENT: In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Grandy</u>, 64 AD2d 796 (3d Dept
1978), the Appellate Division specifically held that leaving part-time
employment in order to qualify for benefits was a disqualifying act. The court
noted the unfairness of penalizing a claimant who had taken additional
employment, but concluded that &quot;unemployment insurance is not a minimum
wage substitute and one may not voluntarily leave employment to secure its
advantages&quot;. The Board, in deciding that the claimant had good cause to
quit because he was unable to meet his regular expenses on monies earned from
his part-time job has, in effect, overruled the Appellate Division, an act
beyond the Board's authority. In almost every case where a claimant loses a
full-time job and is left with only part-time income, it is likely to be the
case that the part-time income is insufficient to support the claimant and any
family members for which the claimant is responsible.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>In essence, the Board's objection to the decision in&nbsp;<u>Grandy</u>,
is an objection to the unfairness which can be created by the requirement that
a claimant must be totally unemployed on any given day to be eligible for
benefits. The court in&nbsp;<u>Grandy</u>&nbsp;recognized the unfairness, but
noted that &quot;any change in the meaning of total unemployment must be
accomplished by legislative means&quot;. The majority's attempt to distinguish
the facts in this case from the facts in Grandy is not persuasive. The fact
that this claimant did not explicitly state that she was quitting, as had
the&nbsp;<u>Grandy</u>&nbsp;claimant, ignores the reality that the reason that
the claimant quit her part-time job was so she could collect benefits.
Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the&nbsp;<u>Grandy</u>&nbsp;claimant
was not similarly suffering financial hardship. It is reasonable to conclude
that any individual who loses a full-time job, and is left with the income from
a part-time job only, will face some degree of financial hardship.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>The majority's reference to the amendments to Labor Law § 593 is similarly
unconvincing. None of the reasons added to the statute by the Legislature
relate in any way to a claimant's financial circumstances. Rather, the reasons
specified, which are characterized as &quot;compelling family reasons&quot;,
include domestic violence, the illness or disability of a family member, and
the claimant's need to accompany a spouse who has relocated. Had the
Legislature considered that financial necessity should constitute good cause to
resign, it could easily have included that reason in the amendment. It is
entirely irrelevant that the state was eligible to receive additional Federal
funding as a result of amending the statute.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>The majority has also referred to that section of the law which
refers to a change in circumstances which would have justified a refusal of an
offer of employment pursuant to Labor Law § 593 (2). The circumstances under
which a claimant may refuse training to which he is suited by training and
experience include the following: accepting the job would interfere with a claimant's
right to join or retain membership in a labor union; there is an industrial
controversy in the establishment where the employment is offered; the
employment is at an unreasonable distance or the commuting costs are
substantially greater than that required in the claimant's former employment;
the job does not offer the prevailing wage. There has been no contention that
the job does not offer the prevailing wage, nor any question of an industrial
controversy or other labor union issue. The approximate distance of twelve
miles between the claimant's home and her part-time job cannot under any
circumstances be considered an unreasonable distance; and there was no actual
change in the claimant's commuting costs. This section of the law does not
offer any support for the majority's decision.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>Unquestionably, the claimant will suffer financial difficulties as
a result of the loss of her full-time job, a condition which applies to all
individuals who lose their employment. But the court held in&nbsp;<u>Grandy</u>&nbsp;that
such difficulties are not good cause to voluntarily leave employment, and the
Legislature has not provided otherwise in the statute. For these reasons, I
dissent from the majority's decision.</span></p>

color:black'>2. The Appeal Board based its decision, in part, on the language
found in the Labor Law § 593.1.b, amended May 20, 2009, which states that a
“claimant shall not be disqualified from receiving benefits for separation from
employment due to any compelling family reason. For the purpose of this
paragraph, the term ‘compelling family reason’ shall include, but not be
limited to, separations related to any of the following: (i) domestic
violence…(ii) the illness or disability of a member of the individual’s
immediate family.” As the Appeal Board pointed out in its decision, while the
statute lists two examples of a compelling reason for leaving one’s employment,
the statute clearly states that good cause is not “limited” to those reasons.
It should further be noted that the 2009 amendments to subdivision 1 added
additional expansive language to Section 593.1 (“In addition to other
circumstances that may be found to constitute good cause, including a
compelling family reason as set forth in paragraph (b) of this
subdivision,...”) which suggests the possible bases are not limited to
compelling family reasons.</span></p>

claimant who leaves part-time employment after layoff from concurrent full-time
employment does so with good cause when compelling reasons exist and such
action is not based solely on the desire to collect unemployment insurance
benefits. (A.B. 355,494;&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.labor.state.ny.us/ui/aso/19.htm#1962">A-750-1962)</a>&nbsp;and
a claimant has good cause to quit a part-time job paying less than the benefit
rate when increased transportation costs, relating to that job, are caused by
the loss, under non-disqualifying conditions, of a concurrent full-time job
located nearby. (A.B. 409,186;&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.labor.state.ny.us/ui/aso/20.htm#2046">A-750-2046</a>). In A.B.
355,494, the compelling reasons were based on the claimant’s inability to
afford child care and travel expenses.</span></p>

normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>4. The Board’s holding focused on the fact that the claimant’s
monthly living expenses greatly exceeded her part-time employment earnings
which included travel expenses which were a substantial portion of such
earnings. The Board also noted that the claimant’s part-time job was four days
of week which would have eliminated her ability to receive partial benefits.</span></p>

the fact-finding should include obtaining information necessary to make an
analysis based on the holding of the Board. Attached is a questionnaire
containing questions relevant to the issues relied on in the three noted Board
decisions as well as other questions requesting financial information to
determine the expenses of the claimant to compare with the potential benefits.
Consideration should also be given to any other significant information
received which has a bearing on whether the retention of part-time employment
creates an untenable financial hardship for the claimant which rises to the
level of a compelling personal or family reason for leaving part-time
employment.</span></p>

color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT: The claimant worked for the employer, an
insurance company, as a service star representative from May 10, 2010 until
April 29, 2014. He worked full time and earned $14.34 per hour. The claimant
was entitled to two fifteen minute breaks and a half hour lunch period. On June
18, 2013, the claimant received a final written warning regarding the
claimant’s work avoidance. The warning indicated that the claimant had been
late returning from his scheduled breaks and lunches on numerous occasions. The
warning also noted that any further occurrences will result in further
discipline up to and including termination of employment. After receiving the
final warning, the claimant continued to return late from his lunch and breaks
on more than one occasion thereafter. On April 24, 24, {sic} 2014, the claimant
returned late from his scheduled break. Thereafter, the employer discharged the
claimant from returning late from his scheduled break after receiving a final
warning.</span></p>

color:black'>OPINION: The credible evidence establishes that the claimant was
discharged due to continually returning from breaks and lunches in a tardy
fashion after receiving a final written warning. In the case before us, the
claimant failed to provide a compelling reason that would excuse his failure to
report back to work as scheduled, as required by the employer. The fact that
the claimant continued tardy returns from breaks and lunches after receiving a
final warning does not negate the fact that he engaged in misconduct even
though the employer did not adhere to its own work policy. In Matter of Brown,
83 AD3d 1231, the Court reasoned that it was the employer's prerogative to
determine if a claimant’s actions rose to the level of misconduct warranting
discharge even though the employer had not enforced its last chance agreement
by allowing the claimant to commit other disciplinary infractions without
consequences prior to being discharged. In the instant case, the claimant was
issued a final warning which clearly stated that further occurrences of this
nature would result in discharge. The claimant’s late returns from breaks and
lunch caused the employer to suffer a detriment, as the claimant's absence
impaired the employer's ability to adequately service its clients. As a
consequence, the claimant's actions rose to the level of misconduct for
unemployment insurance purposes. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant was
separated from employment under disqualifying circumstances.</span></p>

color:black'>1. In A.B. 591,009 the Appeal Board stated, “we note that the
Court and the Board have revised their theory of condonation to excuse a
claimant’s misconduct holding that it is the employer’s prerogative whether or
not to overlook conduct that would otherwise be in violation of the employer’s
policy.” (See Matter of Brown, 83 AD3d 1231; A.B. 588,396; A.B. 582,970).</span></p>

color:black'>2. In A.B. 581,580, the Board concluded that condonation occurs
only when the “employer takes no action in response to an employee’s act.” In
A.B. 581,580, the employer advised the claimant immediately after he was found
guilty of driving while intoxicated that he would be discharged if he could not
obtain a conditional license within 45 days during which time he was given
interim non-driving duties. The employer did not condone the claimant’s act of
driving while intoxicated by providing interim non-driving duties. The act of
driving while intoxicated and failure to obtain a conditional license
constituted misconduct.</span></p>

color:black'>3. In A.B. 549,078, the Board ruled that the claimant’s continued
tardiness after receiving a final warning should not be excused on the grounds
of condonation. Less than two months passed between the final warning and the
separation and the claimant admitted that he was aware that his job was in
jeopardy. The last occurrence was the direct result of the claimant’s violation
of the vehicle and traffic laws. Therefore, the claimant was at fault for the
final instance of tardiness and his late arrival to work after receiving a
final warning constituted misconduct.</span></p>

840 [1989], lv denied 75 NY2d 711 [1990]). &quot;Pursuant to Labor Law § 590
(10), a claimant who is employed in an instructional capacity by an educational
institution is precluded from receiving unemployment insurance benefits during
'any week commencing during an established and customary vacation period or
holiday recess, not between such academic terms or years, provided the claimant
performed services for such institution immediately before such vacation period
or holiday recess and there is a reasonable assurance that the claimant will
perform any services . . . in the period immediately following such vacation
period or holiday recess'&quot; (Matter of Scott [Commissioner of Labor], 25
AD3d 939, 939-940 [2006]). Initially, this Court has repeatedly held that the
interpretation of plain language in Labor Law § 590 (10) is a matter for
resolution by the courts, not subject to deference in regard to the Board's
interpretation (see Matter of Scott [Commissioner of Labor], 25 AD3d at 940;
Matter of Abramowitz [City Univ. of N.Y.-Hartnett], 156 AD2d at 839; Matter of
Lintz [Roberts], 89 AD2d 1038, 1038 [1982]). This Court has well established
precedent interpreting the identical phrase in Labor Law § 590 (10),
&quot;reasonable assurance,&quot; regarding two successive academic years or
terms to require &quot;a representation by the employer&quot; as to future
employment (Matter of Rosenbaum [Borough of Manhattan Community Coll., City
Univ. of N.Y.-Commissioner of Labor], 125 AD3d 1019, 1020 [2015] [internal

Matter of Murphy [Copake-Taconic Cent. School Dist.-Commissioner of Labor], 17
AD3d 762, 763 [2005]). This representation often takes the form of a letter
from an employer assuring a per diem substitute teacher of future employment
opportunities (see e.g. Matter of Murphy [Commissioner of Labor], 85 AD3d 1478,
1479 [2011]; Matter of Schwartz [New York City Dept. of Educ.-Commissioner of

claimant or provided him with any other form of notice that made a

11, 2016, with an effective date of July 11, 2016, and a weekly benefit rate of
$295; indicated that his last employer was the Buffalo City School District.
The claimant worked for the Buffalo school district as a per diem substitute
teacher during the 2016-2017 school year, earning $121 a day. The claimant
obtained his work both through telephone calls and through accessing the
employer’s Automated Employees Substitute Operating System, known as AESOP, to
search for work.</span></p>

and ended on January 2, 2017. The seven-day period before the start of the
winter holiday recess was December 19-25, 2016. The claimant worked as a per
diem substitute teacher for the employer on December 19, 2016, December 21,
2016, December 22, 2016, and December 23, 2016, in the week before the holiday
recess. After the winter holiday recess, the claimant worked January 3, 2017,
January 4, 2017, January 5, 2017, and January 6, 2017. The employer also closed
schools for recesses in February and April 2017, but those specific recess
dates have not been established.</span></p>

statutory week ending January 1, 2017. When he certified for benefits on
January 2, 2017, the claimant indicated that he was not working due to “lack of
work”. The claimant received benefits for that week. The claimant certified for
benefits on February 27, 2017, for the week ending February 26, 2017. When he
certified for benefits on February 27, 2017, the claimant indicated that he was
not working due to “lack of work”. The claimant further certified for benefits
on April 17, 2017, for the statutory week ending April 16, 2017, and in so
doing, indicated that he was no longer working due to “lack of work”. In each
case the claimant indicated that he was not working due to “lack of work.” He
believed this accurately represented his situation since he had previously won
all of his reasonable assurance cases and had been held eligible to receive
benefits; the claimant thought that meant that he was eligible for benefits
during the 2016-2017 school year even if he was a school employee.</span></p>

color:black'>The employer utilizes the AESOP system, to find substitute
teachers to fill in for absent full-time teachers. Substitute teachers may
obtain work from the Buffalo City School District in four ways: they can log
into the AESOP website with their account number and PIN number and look for
available jobs themselves; they can call into AESOP at an 800 number and be
presented with job openings to accept or reject; the AESOP system calls
substitute teachers to offer them work; and school administrators or clerical
staff can offer positions to substitutes directly if the substitute is
registered with AESOP. AESOP notes the identification number of any
substitute(s) who works in the week before a regularly scheduled holiday recess
period, and programs a priority to call those substitutes for open positions in
the week after the regularly scheduled holiday recess period before calling those
who did not work during the week before the break for that position. That
programming priority lasts for one week. The claimant worked on January 3,
January 4, January 5, and January 6, 2017.</span></p>

has held that position for four years. Her job duties include working with all
the substitute teachers from their initial application, to the interview
process, to their onboarding as an employee, processing their paperwork,
conducting their orientation and training, inputting their information into the

color:black'>The Appeal Board has held reasonable assurance is not the same for
the week following a customary vacation or recess as it is between academic
years or terms. For an assurance of reemployment to be reasonable for a
significantly shorter period of time than the normal period between academic
years (namely for the week following a vacation or recess), there must be a
greater likelihood that the person will be considered and possibly called to
work during the specified week. Further, an employer must demonstrate, with
competent testimony from knowledgeable witnesses concerning the employer's
personnel practices and hiring procedures, that it had a &quot;priority
list&quot; which is used to call substitutes during the week after the
customary vacation or recess and that the employer would only include on this
&quot;priority list&quot; those substitutes who had worked in the week prior to
the vacation or recess. (See Appeal Board Nos. 553407, 550833, 360620.) Additionally,
the Court has held that the employer must make a representation, or provide
notice to the claimant, if he worked in the week immediately preceding a
customary vacation or recess that he will receive employment opportunities in
the week immediately following such customary vacation or recess. (See Matter
of Papapietro, ___ A. D. 3d ___, 2017 NY Slip Op 08596, decided December 7,
2017.)</span></p>

color:black'>The employer's witness qualified herself to testify as to the
operation of the employer’s systems and the claimant's work history and
placement on the programming preference list by testifying as to her training
and experience. The credible and undisputed evidence establishes that the
Buffalo City School District informed the claimant by letter dated June 13,
2016 that if he worked the week before any vacation and/or holiday recess
during the 2016-2017 school year, your name will be placed on a priority list
of substitutes for the week immediately following the vacation or holiday
recess; that the claimant worked for the Buffalo City School District in the
week immediately prior to the regularly scheduled winter holiday recess, that
he worked in the week immediately after the winter holiday recess and that the
claimant obtained his work both through telephone calls from the employer's
AESOP system and through his own efforts in seeking work through its website.
The credible evidence further establishes that, after the winter holiday
recess, the employer had put the claimant on a priority list within its AESOP
program, which identified those substitutes who had worked the week prior to
the winter holiday recess and was to make offers to those substitutes before
first calling any other substitutes in the week after the winter holiday recess
when classes resumed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>The employer's AESOP post-holiday priority system is equivalent to
the &quot;priority list&quot; traditionally used to call the substitutes who
had worked the week prior to a customary holiday recess to work in the week
immediately thereafter. It is not dispositive that the claimant had worked on a
given day pursuant to an offer he obtained from his own efforts, as it is the
action of the employer and not the action of the claimant that satisfies the
statutory requirements. (See Appeal Board Nos. 588123, 582762, 582465, 577620,
550581, 545142, and 543943.) It is also not relevant that the claimant did not
receive specific and personal notice immediately prior to the winter recess
that he would be employed in the week thereafter, as he had been informed in
June 2016 that if he worked the week before a customary vacation or holiday
recess period that his name would be placed on the employer’s post-holiday
priority list to be called for employment opportunities. Based upon the
foregoing, the Board concludes that the employer has established, through
competent testimony and evidence, that the claimant's name was placed on a
priority list through the AESOP system to be called for work in the week
immediately after the winter holiday recess and that the employer made a
good-faith effort to contact the claimant for work in that week. The Board
further concludes that the claimant had reasonable assurance of working in the
week following the winter holiday recess and, therefore, the exclusionary
provisions of Labor Law § 590 (10) apply. Consequently, the benefits the
claimant received for those weeks constitute an overpayment of benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>Nonetheless, the Board concludes that the employer has failed to
establish that the claimant had reasonable assurance that he would be called
for work in the weeks immediately after the February and April holiday recess
periods. We note that the employer’s witness was unable to definitively state
the beginning and ending dates of their February and April holiday recess
periods and that the employer’s witness did not produce a copy of the school
calendar for the 2016-2017 school year for the record. Thus, we are unable to
determine whether the claimant worked in the seven days immediately prior to
the regularly scheduled holiday recess periods in February and April. In
addition, we are unable to determine whether he was offered work in the seven
days immediately after the regularly scheduled holiday recess periods at issue.
Accordingly, the Board concludes that the claimant did not have reasonable
assurance of employment for the periods immediately following the holiday
recess periods in February and April and, therefore, there was no overpayment
of benefits for those weeks.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black'>Furthermore, the credible evidence establishes that the claimant
certified for benefits on January 2, 2017, February 27, 2017, and April 17,
2017 by indicating that he was not working due to a lack of work. We accept as
credible the claimant’s testimony that he was not working due to a lack of work
because it was the best choice offered to him to explain his situation as he
understood it to be. As a per diem employee, the claimant’s employment
relationship with the employer for the periods in question ended at the end of
each assignment. We note that prior to the beginning of each holiday recess
period, no one from the employer had offered the claimant work for any period
after the holiday recess. Also, the claimant’s certification that he was not
working due to a lack of work was technically accurate as there was no work for
him during the regularly scheduled holiday recess periods. We also note that
the claimant had prevailed in all his prior reasonable assurance cases.
Moreover, the Board has never required that a layman engage in legal reasoning
to maintain eligibility for benefits. (See Appeal Board No. 590044.) For all
these reasons, we are unable to conclude that the claimant had knowledge that
he would not be entitled to benefits herein. Accordingly, we conclude that the
claimant’s certification that he was not working due to a lack of work did not
constitute a factually or willfully false statement, and, therefore, that the
benefits he received are not recoverable, and no forfeiture or monetary penalty
should be imposed.</span></p>
