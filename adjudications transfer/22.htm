mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant applied for
unemployment insurance benefits on July 3, 2006, and a weekly benefit rate was
established. When claimant was interviewed by a Department of Labor
representative in early August 2006, she indicated that she had applied for her
pension from the employer. Claimant received her first pension check on August
25, 2006, retroactive to July 1, 2006, and promptly notified the Department.
Prior to that time, claimant had received unemployment insurance benefits in
the amount of $2,430. Because the prorated weekly amount of claimant’s pension
exceeded her weekly benefit rate, the Unemployment insurance Appeal Board
reduced claimant’s weekly benefit rate to zero and charged her with a
recoverable overpayment.&nbsp; Upon reconsideration, the Board adhered to its
prior decision, prompting this appeal by claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Substantial evidence
supports the Board’s decision reducing claimant’s benefit rate to zero and
charging her with a recoverable overpayment of benefits. The record reflects
that claimant is receiving a pension that is fully funded by her former
employer and that the prorated weekly amount of her pension exceeds her weekly
unemployment insurance benefit rate. Under such circumstances, the Board
properly reduced claimant’s benefit rate to zero (<u>see</u>&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Ziegler [Commissioner of Labor</u>], 28 AD3d 895, 895-896 [2006], lv denied 7
NY3 708 [2006];&nbsp;<u>Matter of Hosenfeld [Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 280
AD2d 738 [2001];&nbsp;<u>Matter of Hammer [Commissioner of Labor]</u>, 263 AD2d
608 [1999];&nbsp;<u>see also</u>&nbsp;Labor Law § 600 [7]). Similarly, although
claimant indeed disclosed her pension and receipt of those benefits to the
Department, the conditional payment of unemployment insurance benefits prior to
verification of the details of a claimant’s pension is subject to review and
recovery of an overpayment (see Labor Law § 597 [3], [4]). Thus, claimant was
properly charged with a recoverable overpayment even though she was not at
fault (<u>see</u>&nbsp;Labor Law § 597 [3], [4]; § 600 [7] [c];&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Hosenfeld [Commissioner of Labor]</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>;&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Hammer [Commissioner of Labor]</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>1. When the claimant in
this case filed an original claim on 7/03/06, she stated that she had neither
applied for nor was receiving a pension. On 8/06/06 however, she disclosed that
she had applied for a pension, but that she did not know when she would receive
it, or how much it would be. The claimant’s benefits were properly released and
she was advised to inform the Department when the first pension payment was
received. Claimant did so, and as the statute specifically addresses this
factual situation, the proper determinations were issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>2. Section 600.7 (c)
states: “If, at the time benefits are payable, it has not been established that
the claimant will be receiving such pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity
or other payment, benefits due shall be paid without a reduction, subject to
review within the period and under the conditions as provided in subdivisions
three and four of section five hundred ninety-seven with respect to retroactive
payment of remuneration”. Sections 597.3 &amp; 597.4, taken together state in
effect that a claimant’s eligibility may be redetermined within six months of a
retroactive payment of remuneration and that any resulting overpayment is
recoverable, provided no decision has been rendered upon the merits of the
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pension payment is handled in the same manner as a retroactive payment of
remuneration. A claimant’s rate may be reduced provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

decision (hearing or appeal) rendered on the merits; and<br>
b) the conditions enumerated in Section 600.7 (a) and (b) have been met; and<br>
c) the matter is reviewed and a redetermination issued within six months of the
retroactive pension payment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>4. Although not
applicable to the above case, it remains true that if a claimant falsely states
that he or she has not applied for or is not receiving a pension such statement
is both factually and willfully false. A willful false statement gives the Commissioner
the right to review the matter and issue a redetermination with no time
limitation. Both the factually false statement and the willfully false
statement constitute a basis for the recovery of any overpayment caused by the
false statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

2012 and April 20, 2012, the claimant performed volunteer services as a
clerical aide at Lincoln Hospital as a participant in its Volunteer /
Internship Program. He was issued an identification badge as a volunteer upon
successfully completing prerequisite tests. The claimant volunteered at Lincoln
Hospital on Tuesdays through Fridays for seven to eight hours a day on various
shifts from 6 am to 4:30 pm. He was not paid for his hours of service. He was
provided a daily $5 meal ticket. During his one hour lunch, the claimant went
every day to the Bronx Workforce office in an attempt to obtain paid
employment. He would submit his resume or apply on-line for positions. The
claimant told Lincoln Hospital that he would be leaving every day to go to the
Bronx Workforce office or to go to job interviews. The claimant continued
volunteering at Lincoln Hospital until June 12, 2012. On June 27, 2012, the
claimant began working as a paid employee of the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

found that the claimant was totally unemployed. Here, following the Court’s
lead in&nbsp;<i>Alexander</i>, we do not find that the claimant’s volunteer
activities constitute work. Significantly, the claimant was not paid for his
hours of service; he went every day to the Bronx Workforce office in an attempt
to obtain paid employment; and he submitted his resume or applied on-line for

that he was going to the Bronx Workforce office or to go to job interviews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the claimant ultimately obtained employment with Lincoln Hospital change our
analysis. In Appeal Board No. 554731,&nbsp;<i>aff’g</i>&nbsp;A.L.J. Case No.
010-18444, the claimant, an attorney, was hospitalized from April 23, 2010
through May 13, 2010. He derived his income from work as a cab driver. While in
the hospital, he did&nbsp;<i>pro bono</i>&nbsp;legal work on cases. We found
that the performance of&nbsp;<i>pro bono</i>&nbsp;work while he was
hospitalized did not affect his total unemployment because it was not in
“gainful employment”. We so held even though the activity might lead the
claimant to become employed at some future time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the claimant received a $5 for a meal ticket alter our analysis. In Appeal
Board No. 433248, the claimant, who was the president of his union, continued
to perform his union-related activities including speaking with members and
management about work issues. The claimant received a fixed quarterly sum of
$275 from the union as reimbursement for expenses. The Board found that his
union activities were in connection with the office he held with the union and
that he was totally unemployed, notwithstanding that he was paid a sum for
reimbursement of expenses. Similarly, in Appeal Board No. 488719, the claimant,
a deputy fire coordinator, provided assistance at various fires and hazardous
materials incidents. He received an annual yearly stipend of $2,566.20. The
Board found that the stipend was intended to reimburse expenses incurred,
rather than a wage. In the case at hand, we find that the $5 meal ticket was
not intended as a wage, but as a reimbursement for a meal expense while he
performed unpaid volunteer services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that engaging in unpaid volunteer services, when one is also actively seeking
work, does not mandate a finding of ineligibility. In fact, engaging in such
activity in this day and age is a way of obtaining employment. We find that it
was not the intention of the Legislature nor the public policy of this State
that unemployment benefits be denied to claimants who engage in such activity
in order to improve their chances of obtaining employment (<i>See e.g.</i>&nbsp;Appeal
Board No. 360187). To the extent that this decision conflicts with prior
decisions that&nbsp;<i>mandate</i>&nbsp;a finding of ineligibility when
engaging in volunteer services and subsequently obtaining employment with that
organization, the Board will no longer follow those decisions. Accordingly, we
conclude that the claimant was totally unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Appeal Board has overruled its prior decisions on this issue, holding that
volunteer activities that improve a claimant’s chances of employment are
consistent with the intent of the Labor Law to assist individuals who are
“unemployed through no fault of their own” (Section 501). It should be noted
that the Appeal Board’s decision extends this principle beyond volunteering for
charitable and civic purposes to work activities with for profit and
not-for-profit employers with, or without, highly structured environments.
However, if the volunteer activity includes a contract of hire by guaranteeing
employment upon completion of training, then the volunteer training program is
still considered employment. (See A-710-45, “Apprentice &amp; Employer
Training,” Section B).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

decision is also consistent with the principles set forth in Unemployment
Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 16-12, “Payment of Unemployment
Compensation to Individuals who are Volunteering” (April 19, 2012). The purpose
of this UIPL is “to strongly encourage states to both promote volunteerism in
their communities, and interpret state law to not disqualify individuals from
receipt of Unemployment Compensation (UC) as a result of volunteer activities.

engage in volunteer activities may now be, based on this Appeal Board decision,
totally unemployed, there is still the possibility that they may not be
available for work. “A claimant doing genuine volunteer work…who is willing to
reschedule or drop the work should it conflict with regular employment, and who
is free to make and is making a diligent effort to find employment, is eligible
for benefits” (Field Memo, 11-82 “Volunteer Work”). However, if the claimant
refuses suitable employment in favor of the volunteer activities, he/she is
subject to disqualification. If the claimant is not actively searching for
work, then he/she is subject to disqualification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant, a licensed attorney in the State of New York, worked as a municipal
executive from January 2008 until May 15, 2012 when she lost her employment in
September 2012 under circumstances not at issue. Since 2008 she ended her
activities for her private law practice which was based in her home. She did
not keep a legal calendar for that period. She did not deduct anything from the
law firm on her personal income taxes in 2010, 2011 or 2012. She was listed in
official publications as an attorney specializing in municipal planning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>On October 15, 2012, she
filed an original claim for benefits online. While receiving benefits, she
continued to provide free legal services for two churches she had dealt with in
her former city executive capacity. The first church, represented by its own
counsel, was scheduled for demolition. The claimant gave assistance on how to
use the media to try to halt this. She addressed the municipal zoning board of
appeals. She made telephone calls, created e-mails and produced some legal
documents for a dispute involving sale of the church’s property. The second
church was scheduled to be closed by its religious authority. The claimant assisted
members of the congregation to articulate and publicize their opposition to
this decision. She counseled a long-time, former real estate client, to reduce
the asking price to facilitate the sale of his business. She advised an energy
entrepreneur trying to open an energy company. Had he succeeded, the claimant
may have been hired as a corporate official, not as an attorney. She counseled
a long-time female friend who did not have the resources to hire an attorney
for her post-divorce, domestic abuse problems. This person was not yet ready to
take legal action. The claimant did not receive remuneration for these efforts.
On average, she spent an hour or less on these matters for two days a week. She
spent several hours on days when she was drawing up legal paperwork for the
churches. During the benefit period, she checked two e-mails addresses for her
law firm twice a week. She handed out business cards with her contact
information in order to generate the possibility for new business. She did not
advertise her legal services. Her pro bono efforts did not produce new business
for the law firm because of the impact of the circumstances of her separation
from her last employment. She continued to seek work as a municipal official
without success. During the benefit period the claimant had three illnesses
that reduced her activity level. As of January 2014, the legal matters she was
involved in were no longer active and remained incomplete. The claimant
acknowledged that on the following days she provided pro bono legal services to
the foregoing entities and individuals: October 27, November 7, November 19,

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>After she filed her
claim for benefits, the claimant accessed, printed and read the&nbsp;<i>Claimant
Information Handbook</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter&nbsp;<i>Handbook</i>). On page 9,
she read the section entitled,&nbsp;<i>“What is considered work”</i>&nbsp;which
stated, “You must report all the work that you perform whether it is for
yourself, a friend, a relative, an employer, or in connection with a public
office that you hold. Any activity that brings in or may bring in income at any
time must be reported. You are considered employed on any day when you perform
any services, even an hour or less, in self-employment, on a freelance basis,
or for someone else. It makes no difference whether this work is in covered
employment or whether you get paid for that day….” On page 10, she read the
section entitled,&nbsp;<i>“What if I do volunteer work?”</i>&nbsp;which stated,
“You may be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits while volunteering,
providing the volunteer work meets the following criteria: volunteer work is
for a charitable, or religious, or special organization and you do not receive
payment in any form for your volunteer work; if the volunteer work is not a
precondition to being hired or rehired into a paid position; and your volunteer
duties do not interfere with your ability to search for work and do not affect
or limit the number of days and hours you are going to work. You may be
considered employed on any day or any part of a day when you perform even minor
duties or favors for a friend or relative’s business whether you get paid or
not. You should call the TCC [Telephone Claims Center] and give all details
before claiming benefits.” In November 2012, the claimant spoke to a Department
of Labor representative in the Division of Employment Services office in Troy,
New York (hereinafter DOES) about her certification situation. She was
concerned about the effect of the advice she provided to her friend, the energy
entrepreneur on her eligibility. The claimant did not expect to be hired by him
until the fall of 2013. The claimant was advised that the possibility of work
for any company she may have formed was so remote that her services for him
would not be considered work for unemployment insurance purposes. She was not
verbally advised to call the TCC for information on certification for benefits.
She did not expect and was not paid for her pro bono work. For each week during
her benefit period, the claimant certified to having done no work in reliance
on the criteria articulated in the section entitled, “What if I do volunteer
work?” As a result of her weekly certifications, she received $9,315 in regular
unemployment insurance benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the claimant’s application to reopen A.L.J. Case Nos. 113-09973 and

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The credible evidence
establishes that during the claimant’s benefit period, starting on October 15,
2012 through April 29, 2013, the claimant provided occasional free legal
services to individuals and religious organizations. We disagree with the
Judge’s conclusion that the claimant should have known from the written advice
in the&nbsp;<i>Handbook</i>&nbsp;under the section&nbsp;<i>“What is considered
work?”</i>&nbsp;that her occasional pro bono activities constituted work for
unemployment insurance purposes simply because she had an extant though
inactive law firm. We find that the claimant’s activities fall squarely within
the guidelines described in the section&nbsp;<i>“What if I do volunteer work?”</i>&nbsp;Although
she handed out her business cards with contact information during these pro
bono activities and checked e-mails, neither the cards nor her free services
enhanced her ability to generate new business on behalf of her defunct law
firm. Significantly, she did not advertise on behalf of the law firm. She made
no court appearances. She earned no money. She also continued her search for
work in her chosen field of municipal service. This set of facts stands in
contrast with those in&nbsp;<i>Matter of Moreira-Brown</i>&nbsp;(36 AD3d 987).
That attorney was in the start-up phase of a law firm and expended substantial
efforts to acquire legal work. Notably, none of his activities involved
rendering free legal services. In the case now before us, we have an inactive
law firm which has not generated any income in years since 2008. The Court
in&nbsp;<i>Matter of Haseltine</i>, 30 AD3d 938, held that a claimant who
ceased operating her construction business, stopped performing services because
she was working for her employer and had only not terminated the certificate of
doing business was held not to stand to gain financially from her defunct
business. There was no evidence that she performed substantial activities on
behalf of that business while collecting benefits. The same applies to the instant
case where the claimant handed out her business card while performing pro bono
work but had no success getting any business for her defunct law firm while
looking for work as a municipal executive without success. The claimant’s free
legal activities did not resurrect her law firm as an active, functioning law
practice capable of growing and providing an income. As there was no ongoing
business, we further conclude that the claimant did not stand to gain
financially from her law firm (Compare&nbsp;<i>Matter of Restivo</i>, 24 AD3d
1007 wherein that claimant performed minimal activities for an ongoing business
and was held to lack total unemployment). Finally, we also note that as an
ethical matter, attorneys are now encouraged and may be required to perform
such free legal services for individuals and organizations with no means to pay
for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We recently reconsidered
our prior holdings on the matter of performing volunteer services in the
context of total unemployment while receiving unemployment benefits and looking
for work (See Appeal Board No. 577489). The claimant performed services as a
clerical aide for a hospital during his benefit period. As that claimant
searched for work, got reimbursed $5 for meal expenses and received no pay, the
Board found that his volunteer work did not interfere with his search for work.
The Board cited a case involving an attorney who usually drove cabs for his
living, performed pro bono immigration law work on his laptop while in the
hospital (See Appeal Board No. 554731). We concluded that the performance of
such pro bono work did not affect his total unemployment because it was not in
gainful employment, even if the activity might lead the claimant to become
employed at some future time. We also concluded that it was neither the
intention of the Legislature nor the public policy of this State that
unemployment benefits be denied to claimants who engage in such activity in
order to improve their chances of obtaining employment (See Appeal Board No.
360187). Therefore, under the facts of this case we conclude that the claimant
reasonably interpreted the&nbsp;<i>Handbook</i>&nbsp;to infer that her pro bono
legal services constituted volunteer work which fell within the stated
guidelines. Accordingly, we further conclude that the claimant was totally
unemployed and was eligible to receive the benefits she received. It follows
and we so conclude that there is no overpayment of benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The credible evidence
further establishes that, based upon the foregoing analysis, the claimant
accurately certified that she performed no work while searching for work,
performing pro bono services and receiving benefits during the period at issue.
We note that the claimant asked about the certification process when she
reported to the DOES office in Troy. Since the claimant read the pertinent
sections in the&nbsp;<i>Handbook</i>, asked for advice at the DOES office,
believed that she met the criteria under the section,&nbsp;<i>“What if I do
volunteer work?”</i>&nbsp;while diligently looking for work, her weekly
certifications that she did not work the previous week were accurate. There was
no reason why she should have doubted the advice she received when read in
conjunction with the&nbsp;<i>Handbook</i>. Thus, while the claimant could have
called the TCC for advice, there was no apparent reason under these facts to do
so. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant did not make willful
misrepresentations in order to receive benefits and that the 204 effective day
forfeiture penalty shall not be imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lack of total unemployment even when the volunteer services lead to employment
with the same organization or when the organization reimburses the volunteer
for expenses. It should be noted that the Appeal Board’s decision in AB 577,849
extends this principle beyond volunteering for charitable and civic purposes to
work activities with for profit and not-for-profit employers as well as for
individuals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is free to make and is making a diligent effort to find employment is eligible
for benefits” (Field Memo, 11-82 “Volunteer Work”). However, if the claimant
refuses suitable employment in favor of the volunteer activities he/she is
