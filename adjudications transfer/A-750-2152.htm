be effective February 29, 2012 through April 22, 2012, and, as so modified,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;text-autospace:none'>FINDINGS OF
FACT: The claimant filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits effective
August 22, 2011. He did not receive a claimant handbook.</p>

line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            Between
February 29, 2012 and April 20, 2012, the claimant performed volunteer services
as a clerical aide at Lincoln Hospital as a participant in its Volunteer /
Internship Program. He was issued an identification badge as a volunteer upon
successfully completing prerequisite tests. The claimant volunteered at Lincoln
Hospital on Tuesdays through Fridays for seven to eight hours a day on various
shifts from 6 am to 4:30 pm. He was not paid for his hours of service.  He was
provided a daily $5 meal ticket.  During his one hour lunch, the claimant went
every day to the Bronx Workforce office in an attempt to obtain paid
employment. He would submit his resume or apply on-line for positions. The
claimant told Lincoln Hospital that he would be leaving every day to go to the
Bronx Workforce office or to go to job interviews. The claimant continued
volunteering at Lincoln Hospital until June 12, 2012. On June 27, 2012, the
claimant began working as a paid employee of the hospital.</span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            During the
period at issue, the claimant did not report his activities as work when he
certified for benefits.  He received the benefits at issue.  </span></p>
<p class=DefaultText style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            OPINION:
The evidence establishes the claimant performed volunteer services at Lincoln
Hospital between February 29 and April 20, 2012.  We have reconsidered our
position concerning whether a claimant is totally unemployed while performing
volunteer work and concurrently seeking employment. </span></p>
<p class=DefaultText style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            In <i>Matter
of Alexander</i>, 45 AD3d 1143, the claimant assisted relatives at their
business by answering the telephone, taking messages, making copies and faxing
documents.  She was not paid for these activities.  She used the business
computer to aid her job search.  The Court, in reversing the Board, found that
the claimant was totally unemployed.  Here, following the Court s lead in <i>Alexander</i>,
we do not find that the claimant s volunteer activities constitute work. 
Significantly, the claimant was not paid for his hours of service; he went
every day to the Bronx Workforce office in an attempt to obtain paid
employment; and he submitted his resume or applied on-line for positions. We
accept the claimant s testimony that he informed Lincoln Hospital that he was
going to the Bronx Workforce office or to go to job interviews.  </span></p>
<p class=DefaultText style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            Nor does
the fact that the claimant ultimately obtained employment with Lincoln Hospital
change our analysis.  In Appeal Board No. 554731, <i>aff g</i> A.L.J. Case No.
010-18444, the claimant, an attorney, was hospitalized from April 23, 2010
through May 13, 2010.  He derived his income from work as a cab driver.  While
in the hospital, he did <i>pro bono</i> legal work on cases.  We found that the
performance of <i>pro bono</i> work while he was hospitalized did not affect
his total unemployment because it was not in  gainful employment . We so held
even though the activity might lead the claimant to become employed at some
future time.  </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;text-autospace:none'>            Nor
does the fact that the claimant received a $5 for a meal ticket alter our
analysis. In Appeal Board No. 433248, the claimant, who was the president of
his union, continued to perform his union-related activities including speaking
with members and management about work issues.  The claimant received a fixed
quarterly sum of $275 from the union as reimbursement for expenses.  The Board
found that his union activities were in connection with the office he held with
the union and that he was totally unemployed, notwithstanding that he was paid
a sum for reimbursement of expenses.  Similarly, in Appeal Board No. 488719,
the claimant, a deputy fire coordinator, provided assistance at various fires
and hazardous materials incidents.  He received an annual yearly stipend of
$2,566.20.  The Board found that the stipend was intended to reimburse expenses
incurred, rather than a wage.  In the case at hand, we find that the $5 meal
ticket was not intended as a wage, but as a reimbursement for a meal expense
while he performed unpaid volunteer services.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;text-autospace:
none'>Consequently, we find that engaging in unpaid volunteer services, when
one is also actively seeking work, does not mandate a finding of ineligibility.
In fact, engaging in such activity in this day and age is a way of obtaining
employment. We find that it was not the intention of the Legislature nor the
public policy of this State that unemployment benefits be denied to claimants
who engage in such activity in order to improve their chances of obtaining
employment (<i>See e.g.</i> Appeal Board No. 360187).  To the extent that this
decision conflicts with prior decisions that <i>mandate</i> a finding of
ineligibility when engaging in volunteer services and subsequently obtaining
employment with that organization, the Board will no longer follow those
decisions. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant was totally unemployed.  </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;text-autospace:none'>            As
the claimant was totally unemployed, we further conclude that the claimant was
not overpaid unemployment benefits.  We further conclude that the claimant s
certifications do not constitute willful misrepresentations.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;text-autospace:none'>DECISION: The
decision of the Administrative Law Judge is reversed.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;text-autospace:none'>            The
revised determinations are overruled.</p>

claimants who engage in volunteer activities may now be, based on this Appeal
Board decision, totally unemployed, there is still the possibility that they

willing to reschedule or drop the work should it conflict with regular
employment, and who is free to make  and is making a diligent effort to find
employment,  is eligible for benefits  (Field Memo, 11-82  Volunteer Work ).
However, if the claimant refuses suitable employment in favor of the volunteer
activities, he/she is subject to disqualification. If the claimant is not
actively searching for work, then he/she is subject to disqualification.</span></p>
