<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Work in the establishments where
various claimants were employed is paid for at piece rates which vary with the
many different types of skins which are processed. The workers in each shop
customarily receive an equal share of the total earnings of the workers
measured by the piece rates for the work produced. Different arrangements exist
in various shops, but in all the practice prevails for the shop steward to keep
a record of the work produced. When there is insufficient work at hand for the
full labor force to be used each day, management decides how many men will be
required on a given day and the shop steward then selects workers to report so
that there will be an equal distribution of work through a rotation system.
Usually, under this rotation system, each worker is called upon to perform some
work during the course of each work week. He then receives a proportionate
share of the total earnings of the entire group of workers for that week. The
workers are required to communicate with the shop or their chairman each day.
When there is work available they are not called in a fixed group of any given
size, since the number of men to be called on any given day will depend upon
the amount of work on hand and the judgment of the employers.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>For purposes of convenience,
workers in the same shop who live in the same general area may frequently be
called to work at the same time. On days when there is no work for any of the
workers, they may accept other work in their industry provided they have
obtained the consent of their regular employer. Such consent is not necessary
for work outside the industry. All employers do not experience the same slow
periods. There may be occasions when it is slow in one establishment and work
is being performed in other shops. When additional help is required, it is
customary for an employer to notify the union which will fill his request,
giving a priority to workers who have no regular shops and then to workers who
have regular shops but who are currently unemployed. During the many years that
claimants worked in their industry, they rarely experienced unemployment of
sufficient duration to make them eligible for unemployment insurance. Even in
periods of unemployment they customarily had some limited work which would
result in their receiving earnings in excess of the statutory limit. During the
periods when the respective claimants applied for benefits they remained in
constant communication with their respective shop chairmen and reported for
work when there was some. They disclosed such employment and refiled additional
claims at the expiration of such work. The fur industry experienced an
unprecedented poor business period in 1953.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimants are permanently deferred
by the employment office and are not required to report to it for placement
purposes. Many of them sought employment outside their industry in addition to
seeking work through the usual employment channels in the industry, principally
their union.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Based on interviews had with each
of the claimants individually, the respective local offices issued initial
determinations in each case holding each of the claimants ineligible to receive
benefits during the periods therein stated on the ground that they were not
totally unemployed and, in the alternative, holding the claimants ineligible to
receive benefits during the same periods on the ground that they were
unavailable for employment and charging claimants with overpayments in benefits
in the respective amounts stated therein. Each of the claimants requested a
hearing before the referee. The referee overruled the initial determinations in
each case and further ruled that the claimants were not overpaid in benefits.
The Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Inasmuch
as the referee has already rendered a well reasoned opinion in this case, we
adopt the referee’s opinion as the opinion of this Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>I reject the contention that the
respective claimants were not totally unemployed during periods when they personally
performed no services but received a proportionate share of the total earnings
of the entire group of workers in their respective shops. In Appeal Board,
39,451-53, this contention was rejected. It was there held that a pocket book
fromer, who shares the proceeds of the labor of another pursuant to a mutual
arrangement, was totally unemployed within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. I do not regard the Referee’s decision in Case 71-36-53R, relied
on by the Industrial Commissioner’s representative, as controlling. I consider
more applicable the decision in appeal Board, 2626-40, wherein grain shovelers
were held to be totally unemployed and available and eligible for benefits
although an agreement existed which provided for equal distribution and
rotation of work and pooling of earnings. I am mindful of the decision in
Appeal Board, 14,406-47, involving a fur dresser. In that case the Appeal Board
did not pass upon the question of total unemployment, but held that under the
facts there established the claimant was unavailable. The credible evidence in
the instant case differs substantially from that in the case cited where there
were no efforts to secure employment in or out of the fur industry. The
evidence here establishes that claimants made efforts to obtain work. In view
of the many years during which they had worked in this industry, the almost
continuous employment they enjoyed, and their receipt of intermittent
employment even during a period when their industry was experiencing an unprecedented
poor season, it cannot be said that they were unreasonable in primarily seeking
further work in their industry through the principal medium of security such
work, to wit, their union. They did not confine their job seeking efforts to
their union.</span></p>

the ground that they were unavailable for employment, are overruled. Claimants
were not overpaid in benefits. The decision of the referee is affirmed. A
separate order is to be entered n each case. (June 25, 1954)</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant filed for benefits
effective October 6, 1952. A revised initial determination was issued
disqualifying him as of October 6 for refusal of employment without good cause.
During the week preceding the one in which claimant filed for benefits, he
received a communication from a store for which he had worked temporarily as a
re-assembler of toys during the 1951 Christmas season to call at the store for
possible re-employment. The employer had previously paid claimant $1 an hour.
When claimant went to see the employer on October 3, he was again offered $1 an
hour for similar work. Because he had earned a higher rate on other jobs, he
asked for $1.25 an hour. The employer brought its offer up to $1.15. Claimant
lowered his request to $1.20, but there was no agreement and he was not hired.
Claimant is classified as an assembler in the field of electrical equipment. He
has done only unskilled work sine coming to this country from Greece about
three years ago. In Greece, he was a civil service employee for twelve years,
having managed a district office, but he has been handicapped by English
language difficulties and has necessarily done work of the type mentioned above
since his entry into the United States. His last job was with a manufacturer of
loose-leaf binders at $1.05 per hour for about five months until September 25,
1952, when he was laid off.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We make the following additional
findings of fact: Claimant requested a hearing and the referee overruled the
revised initial determination of the local office disqualifying him from
receiving benefits, effective October 6, 1952, on the ground that he refused
employment without good cause. The Industrial Commissioner appealed from that
portion of the referee’s decision adverse to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although there was no evidence
which might be said clearly establish the prevailing rate of pay for the type
of work offered to claimant on October 3 (there being evidence that the union
which furnishes assemblers of stuffed toys has established a rate of pay
ranging from $1.05 to $1.70 an hour), if claimant be regarded as an assembler
in the general, unskilled sense, the evidence indicated that $1.15 an hour was
not substantially less than the prevailing rate in the locality for that unskilled
occupation. The question presented, then, is whether claimant was subject to
disqualification for refusing the job on October 3 in view of the fact that he
was not at that time a registrant for benefits and did not file his original
claim until the following week. Section 593.2 of the Unemployment Insurance Law
reads pertinently as follows:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The foregoing provision has been in
the Law since the inception of benefit payments fifteen years ago. Under that
provision, it has been held uniformly that a person may not be disqualified for
having refused employment at a time which preceded his entry into the
unemployment insurance system. The Appeal Board has specifically ruled in
numerous cases going back to 1941, at least, that there may be no
disqualification under such circumstances, and the Industrial Commissioner has
never sought a reversal of any of those decisions in the courts (Appeal Board,
5743-41; 5944-41; 10,100-43; 29,901-51). The Commissioner’s representative has
not pointed to any changes in the Law effected by the so-called Hughes-Brees
amendments in 1951, or thereafter, which requires that a contrary conclusion
now be reached, and I can perceive no sound basis for overturning the firmly
imbedded principle that there can be no disqualification for a refusal of
employment which occurred before the person involved became a claimant for
unemployment insurance.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The ruling in this case is
applicable solely to a possible disqualification arising under Section 593.2 of
the Law. The Law in Section 592, specifically provides that in cases of
suspension for industrial controversy or misconduct, the suspension periods
shall commence on the day after a claimant has lost his employment. In the case
of a disqualification for voluntary leaving of employment under Section 593.1,
the Law specifically provides that the 42-day disqualification period shall
commence following a claimant’s registration for benefits subsequent to such
voluntary leaving. Similarly, under Section 594, a forfeiture for wilful
misrepresentation in order to obtain benefits may be applied as of the date
when a claimant filed for benefits even though such filing is subsequent in
point of time to the misrepresentation itself. (<u>Matter of King</u>, 278 App.
Div. 1036 reversing Appeal Board, 24,663-50). However, with respect to
disqualification for refusal of employment (section 593.2), the Law provides
that no benefits shall be payable to any&nbsp;<u>claimant</u>&nbsp;who, without
good cause,&nbsp;<u>refuses</u>&nbsp;to accept an offer of employment for which
he is reasonably fitted by training and experience. In Section 516 of the Law,
the term &quot;claimant&quot; is defined as any person seeking benefits for
unemployment. At the time the claimant refused employment he was not a claimant
within the meaning of the Law. Consequently, he should not be disqualified from
receiving benefits for refusal of employment without good cause, since the verb
&quot;refuses&quot; as found in Section 593.2 is in the present tense, and may
not be read as meaning past tense, so as it give it ex post facto effect. Under
such circumstances, no disqualification may lie, since the statute is specific
in this regard, as it is in the cases of suspension, disqualification or
forfeiture set forth in other sections of the Law.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>:
Succinctly put, the question presented here is whether a refusal of an offer of
employment by a person not then claiming benefits, may be the basis for
disqualification under Section 593 subd. 2, of the Unemployment Insurance Law,
when he thereafter applies for benefits. Claimant had been temporarily employed
for a short period of time before Christmas in 1951 as a toy re-assembler.
Thereafter he worked for about five months for another employer and was laid
off on September 25, 1952. On October 3, 1952, his previous employer in the toy
business offered him the same pre-Christmas temporary job as a toy
re-assembler, and claimant refused the offer. The offer has been considered by
the Appeal Board as an offer of &quot;suitable&quot; employment within the
meaning of the statute, and will be so regarded here. At the time of his
refusal of October 3, 1952, claimant had not contacted an Unemployment
Insurance office or filed any claim for benefits. On October 6, 1952, claimant
filed an application for unemployment insurance benefits, and the initial
determination of the Industrial Commissioner disqualified him because of the
refusal of October 3, 1952. After a hearing a referee and the Appeal Board
reversed the initial determination on the ground that the statute does not
authorize disqualification by reason of a &quot;refusal&quot; prior to an
application for benefits. From this decision the Commissioner appeals to this
court. Section 593, subd.2, of the Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor L., Art.
18), provides, in part: &quot;Refusal of employment. No benefits shall be
payable to any claimant who without good cause refuses to accept an offer of
employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience,
including employments not subject to this article.***&quot; It is elementary
that in construing a statute the first guide to legislative intent is the
language of the statute itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous,
resort may not be had to other rules of statutory construction to imply some
different meaning. (<u>Meltzer v. Koenigsberg</u>, 302 N.Y. 523, 525;&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Berson</u>&nbsp;(Corsi), 283 app. Div.190, 193;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Emil
Hubsch Post, V.F.W. (Corsi)</u>, 278 App. Div. 460, 463.) The statute provides
that any &quot;claimant&quot; who &quot;refuses&quot; a suitable job is
disqualified. Had the Legislature intended the disqualification to apply to any
person, claimant or non-claimant, who refuses or has refused a suitable job, it
would have been very simple to have said so. The fact that the work &quot;refuses&quot;
is in the present tense is significant, and is certainly not indicative of any
intention to include the past. The statute limits the disqualification to a
&quot;claimant&quot; who &quot;refuses,&quot; and it seems clear that the
status of claimant and the refusal must be concurrent. Aside from the language
of the statute there are other persuasive reasons for upholding the
construction adopted by the Appeal Board, Section 593, subd. 2, has been a part
of the Unemployment Insurance Law without substantial change since the inception
of the law. Since 1941 the Appeal Board has consistently and repeatedly held
that a person may not be disqualified for having refused employment at a time
which preceded his application for unemployment insurance benefits. In the
interval the law has been amended several times, and in 1944 was completely
re-codified and re-enacted. (L. 1944, Ch. 705.) Had the Legislature desired to
override such administrative construction it could easily have done so, and the
fact that it did not indicates legislative approval of the previous
interpretation given the statute. (<u>Matter of Gilmore v. Preferred Acc. Ins.
Co., 283 N.Y.92,97; Matter of Berson (Corsi), supra</u>.) Moreover, as far as
refusal of a job is concerned, the claimant does not subject himself to the disqualifying
provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law until he brings himself within the
system by seeking benefits. It is inherent in the statute that, before a
disqualification may be imposed, benefit rights must exist from which he might
be disqualified. At the time of this &quot;refusal&quot; there was nothing from
which the claimant might have been disqualified. While in this case the
&quot;refusal&quot; was only three days prior to filing for benefits, the
principle involved would apply if three weeks, or three months, or even a
longer period of time had elapsed. Who is to decide the stopping point? Must an
applicant’s entire work record be investigated to determine, if possible,
whether he ever refused suitable employment without good cause? The practical
difficulties are apparent. While no court decisions directly in point have been
called to our attention, text writers on the subject are in accord with this
view. &quot;A worker cannot be disqualified for refusing a job during a period
in which he is not an applicant for benefits.&quot; Colin,&nbsp;<u>The Law of
Unemployment Insurance in New York</u>, 260 (1950). &quot;In general, an offer
of employment may be made to a claimant at any time. But before the refusal
penalty may be imposed, it must be shown that, at the time of the job offer,
the claimant was unemployed, and had registered and was qualified for
benefits.&quot; Chutroo,&nbsp;<u>Suitable Work under the New York Unemployment
Insurance Law</u>, 7 (1947). The decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board should be affirmed, with costs against the Industrial Commissioner. (July
8, 1954)</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Each claimant filed for benefits
effective March 1, 1954. Initial determinations were issued suspending the
benefits of each claimant for seven weeks effective March 1 because of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which she was employed. All of the
claimants were production workers in the establishment of a manufacturer of
toiletries. Due to material shortages, six of the claimants were laid off on
February 24 with instructions to return on March 1. Seven others were similarly
laid off on February 26 and instructed to return on March 2. On the morning of
March 1, some of the claimants and co-workers who reported to the employer’s
establishment left to participate in a meeting which had been called by an
official of a union, which was the bargaining agent in contractual relations
with the employer, concerning steps to secure reinstatement of the shop steward
and several co-workers who had been dismissed by the employer at the close of
business on February 26. Other claimants and co-workers did not report for work
on March 1 because of their attendance at the meeting which lasted several
hours. The employer locked the doors and refused to permit the claimants to
enter or re-enter the premises to work. Subsequent individual offers of
re-employment were rejected by many of the claimants unless all including those
who had been dismissed, were re-employed at the same time, which the employer
refused to do. The contract provided that no strikes or interruption or
impeding of production would occur during its term and that the employer had
the right to discharge any employee or employees who violated this provision.
By Arbitrator’s award dated March 11, 1954, subsequently confirmed by the
Supreme Court, it was found that a work stoppage or interruption of production
occurred on March 1, 1954, in violation of contract then in effect between the
parties, and that the employees were not locked out in violation of the
contract. The employer refused to recall any of the employees who participated
in the work stoppage and asked the Arbitrator to find that they violated
paragraph 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of the collective agreement and, further, asked
permission to discharge 35 employees (including all of the claimants herein).
The Arbitrator’s award granted the employer’s request to discharge such
employees.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We make the following additional
findings of fact: On March 1, 1954, proceedings were instituted against the
employer by the shop steward before the National Labor Relations Board,
charging the employer with unfair labor practices within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act. The basis of the charge was (1) the discharge by
the employer on February 26, 1954 of the shop steward, forelady and floor
manager &quot;because of their membership and interest in District 65,
D.P.O.W.A.&quot; and(2) that on March 1, 1954 the employer prevented
approximately 53 employees engaged in production and maintenance operations
from reporting to work after they had attended a union meeting of Local 21906,
A.F.L., which was the collective bargaining agent in contractual relations with
the employer. The two unions mentioned were rival unions as far as the
organization of this employer’s employees was concerned. A petition had been
filed with the National Labor Relations Board prior to March 1, 1954 by District
65, D.P.O.W.A., setting forth that a substantial number of the employees wished
to be represented by it for purposes of collective bargaining and requesting
that it be certified as their collective bargaining agent. On March 1, 1954 and
on each work day thereafter, claimants and other employees reported in a body
at the employer’s establishment in an endeavor to return to their employment,
but found the door locked. On each occasion, they were refused admittance by
the employer. Although claimants and other employees were discharged by the
employer effective March 11, 1954, the date of the arbitrator’s award, they
refused to recognize such discharge and the controversy continued unabated
thereafter. Claimants protested the initial determinations of the respective
local offices suspending their accumulation of benefit rights for a period of
seven consecutive weeks effective March 1, 1954 on the ground that they lost
their employment because of a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy
in the establishment in which they were employed, and requested a hearing
before a referee. The referee modified said initial determination by limiting
the suspension of accumulation of benefit rights by claimants to the period
March 1 through March 11, 1954 and sustained said determinations, as so
modified. The Industrial Commissioner and claimants now appeal to the Board
from said decision of the referee, as herein above indicated.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence amply supports the conclusion reached by the referee that
claimants lost their employment because of an industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed within the meaning of Section 592.1
of the Unemployment Insurance Law. It is not disputed that there was an interruption
of production on March 1, 1954, when claimants and numerous other employees
left the establishment in order to attend a union meeting during working hours.
In consequence thereof and of the controversy which followed, they were locked
out by the employer on that day and on each work day thereafter until at least
the date of the hearing before the referee, April 8, 1954. Whether or not such
lockout was justified is not relevant here. We are persuaded to conclude, on
the basis of the record before us, that a strike, lockout or other industrial
controversy existed in the employer’s establishment, commencing March 1, 1954,
within the meaning of the Law and that claimants lost their employment in
consequence thereof. In the brief submitted on behalf of claimants, it is also
argued that the suspension of accumulation of benefit rights by those claimants
who were temporarily laid off on February 24 or 26 and who were instructed to
return to work on March 1 or 2, was not proper, based on the reasoning that their
loss of employment was not occasioned by an industrial controversy. We hold to
the contrary. Such claimants lost their employment on March 1 or 2 because of
the industrial controversy which then existed in the employer's establishment.
In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Sadowski</u>, 257 App. Div. 529, affirming Appeal Board,
229-38, involving a strike which occurred during the period of a claimant's
temporary layoff and before her scheduled return to work, the Court held that
claimant had lost her employment because of the strike. In our opinion, the
decision in that case is determinative of the similar issue raised herein. It
is contended on behalf of the Industrial Commissioner that the referee
erroneously modified the initial determinations of the local offices by
limiting the suspension of accumulation of benefits by claimants to the period
March 1 through March 11, 1954, based on their discharge by the employer on the
latter date. We believe that such contention is correct. In Appeal Board,
41,265-53 through 41,277-53, involving a similar situation, we stated as
follows:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In reaching our conclusion as to
the effect which the notice of termination dated September 17, 1953, sent by
the employer to each of the claimants had upon the 49-day disqualification
previously imposed upon claimants, we are guided by the decision of the
Appellate Division, in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Echeverria</u>, 273 App. Div. 1046
reversing Appeal Board, 16,034-47. In that case, claimant was notified by her
employer on April 4, 1947 that her employment would terminate on April 11,
1947. On April 7 a strike occurred in her employer’s establishment and claimant
refused to cross the picket line although there was work available for her in
her employer’s place of business. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on April
14, 1947. In overruling the decision of the appeal Board holding that, as to
the claimant, the disqualification period terminated on April 11, 1947, the
Appellate Division said:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant
was in employment on April 7 on which day the strike was called and she ceased
her work and did not return because thereof. The section of the statute cited,
supra, requires the suspension of benefit rights &quot;beginning with the day
after&quot; employment is lost because of a strike. The fact that claimant’s
employment was to have terminated by layoff on April 11 per direction of the
employer given on April 4, does not avoid the application of the aforesaid
statutory provision. The amelioration afforded by the Appeal Board’s
construction is, we think, a matter only for legislative consideration.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>What was there stated is
controlling on the similar issue raised in the instant case. Furthermore, the
record before us discloses that the claimants herein refused to recognize their
discharge on March 11, 1954. The controversy continued unabated thereafter
since claimants continued their efforts to regain their employment. The lockout
by the employer remained in effect during the entire period in issue. The initial
determinations of the respective local offices suspending the accumulation of
benefit rights by claimants for a period of seven consecutive weeks effective
March 1, 1954 on the ground that they lost their employment because of a
strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which
they were employed, are sustained in all respects, without modification. The
decision of the referee is modified accordingly and, as so modified, is
affirmed. A separate order is to be entered in each case (August 20,1954)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A
combined hearing was held at which both claimants, representatives of their
attorneys, of their union, of their employer's attorneys, of their employer,
and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Both
claimants are musicians. Claimant Weiss filed for benefits effective March 8,
1954, and refiled effective March 22 after intervening employment. Claimant
Torke filed for benefits effective March 15. By amended initial determinations
the benefits of both claimants were suspended for 49 days effective February 28
because of loss of employment due to an industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed. The facts are undisputed. Claimants
were employed for a number of years by a radio and television broadcasting
station. The contract between the musicians union of which claimants were
members and their employer expired on February 1, 1954. The employment of the
40 staff musicians which included claimants was orally extended to February 15
and thereafter further extended for an indefinite period until either party
notified the other of its termination. Claimants thereafter continued to work
until February 27 when the employer notified them that their services were no
longer required since it had been decided to discontinue the employment of all
the 40 staff musicians and henceforth to conduct its operations without the
services of any staff musicians. Negotiations between the musicians' union and
the employer, which had begun on February 1, were continued. The union placed
pickets outside the employer's establishment with signs that the musicians had
been locked out. Action was thereafter instituted by the employer in the
Supreme Court, New York county, for an injunction&nbsp;<u>pendente</u>&nbsp;<u>lite</u>&nbsp;restricting
the picketing and for other relief. A special Term the motion made by the
defendants (the union) to dismiss the complaint was granted. On appeal
therefrom, the Appellate Division, First Department, by decision dated June 8,
1954, held that there was no labor dispute between the parties and reversed the
contrary holding of the Court below and also affirmed the order of the Court
below denying an injunction&nbsp;<u>pendente</u>&nbsp;<u>lite</u>. Each of the
claimants sought work through the customary channels by which musicians secure
employment after their jobs with the broadcasting company were abolished.
Although claimant Weiss succeeded in securing employment elsewhere, claimant
Torke was unable to do so.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimants
lost their employment as a result of their employer's decision to eliminate
their jobs. All that occurred subsequent to the loss of their jobs was in an
attempt to convince their employer, by negotiation and otherwise, to give them
further employment. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that they
lost their employment because of a strike, lockout, or other industrial
controversy in the establishment in which they were employed. If there was any
industrial controversy it was because of the loss of their employment and not
vice versa. The respective initial determinations are overruled.</span></p>

was held at which two of the claimants and a representative of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimants are rug workers who were
employed by a carpet-cleaning company. Claimant Smith filed effective June 14,
1954. The other two claimants filed effective June 21. Initial determinations
were issued suspending their benefits for seven weeks effective May 28 for loss
of employment through industrial controversy. For a substantial period of time
prior to April 20, 1954 negotiations were carried on between the employer and
representatives of a union which contended that it represented a majority of
employees. The employer refused to enter into a contract with the union or to
recognize it as the representative of its employees and on April 20 all of the
employees stopped work and struck. Picketing was commenced immediately. The
employees returned to work on May 17 when the employer agreed that an election
be held to determine whether or not the union represented a majority of the
workers. Such election was held on May 19 and a majority of the workers chose
the union as its representative. However, the employer refused to enter into a
contract with the union and refused to recognize it as the representative of
all of its workers and on May 27 the employees again ceased work and resumed
picketing. The strike was terminated on July 21 when a contract was entered
into between the union and the employer and the employees resumed work.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
strike commenced on April 20 when the employees refused to work because of the
employer’s refusal to recognize their union as their bargaining agent. It was
not terminated when the employees returned to work on May 17. It was merely
suspended upon the employer’s consent to the holding of an election. The
cessation of work on May 27 was not the commencement of a new controversy, but
merely a resumption of the existing controversy in view of the employer’s
continued refusal to recognize the union following the election. Accordingly,
the suspension of claimants’ benefits commenced April 21, the day following the
beginning of the strike, and the 7-week suspension period terminated June 8.
Since claimants did not file until after the termination of the suspension
period, they are eligible for benefits subject to the other provisions of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. The initial determinations are modified to be
effective April 21 through June 8 and, as modified, are sustained.</span></p>

Industrial Commissioner appeals from the decision of the referee dated August
17, 1954, insofar as it modifies the initial determinations of the local office
suspending the accumulation of benefit rights of claimant, G.J.S., a rug
worker, effective April 20 to May 14, 1954, inclusive, and May 28 to July 15,
1954, inclusive, respectively on the ground that he lost his employment because
of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which he was employed. The
referee modified the determinations by consolidating them and making the
consolidated determination effective April 21 through June 8, 1954. The
Industrial Commissioner also appeals from the decision of the referee, insofar
as it modifies the initial determinations suspending the accumulation of
benefit rights of the respective claimants M.H. and K.A., rug workers,
effective May 28 to July 15, 1954 on the ground, likewise, that they lost their
employment because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which
they were employed. The referee modified said determinations to be effective
April 21 through June 8, 1954. A combined hearing was held before the referee
at which claimants G.J.S. and K.A. and a representative of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and were accorded a full opportunity to be heard.
Claimant M.H. did not appear although duly notified. A brief was submitted on
behalf of the Industrial Commissioner. After a careful review of the record,
testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due deliberation having
been had thereon, and having found that the referee’s findings of fact are
fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no errors of fact appear
to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact made by the referee as
the findings of fact of this Board, except that we find that in the case of
claimant G.J.S., two initial determinations were issued on July 1, 1954,
suspending the benefit rights of that claimant for the periods of April 20 to
May 14, inclusive, and May 28 to July 15, 1954, inclusive. The Board is of the
opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact in this case, except as
above noted. However, we do not agree with the referee in modifying the initial
determinations so as to make the period of suspension from April 21 through
June 8. A single industrial controversy was involved, which terminated on July
21. During the continuance of this controversy, claimants returned to work with
the employer herein for a time. In view of our holding in Appeal Board, 13,368-45,
the seven-week period of suspension, under the facts shown here, is effective
April 21, but is to be applied on a cumulative basis, with the days on which
claimants worked during said period excluded therefrom. The respective initial
determinations of the local office suspending the accumulation of benefit
rights by claimants during a period of seven weeks because of an industrial
controversy in the establishment in which they were employed, are modified, in
each case, to be effective April 21, 1954 and continuing thereafter,
cumulatively, for a period of seven weeks, excluding therefrom, and not
crediting claimants with, as part of the suspension period, such days on which
they resumed work during the continuance of the controversy, and as so
modified, are sustained. The decision of the referee is modified accordingly
and, as so modified, is affirmed. A separate order is to be entered in each
case. (September 24, 1954)</span></p>

the Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact in
this case, we do not agree that claimant’s wilful false statement was not made
for the purpose of obtaining benefits. Although not expressly stated by the
referee in his opinion, it is clear that he considered claimant’s
misrepresentation not subject to the penalty provided by law merely because
claimant’s alteration of the date on which he was required to report to the
employment service was prompted by his desire to report sooner than required in
order to be referred to employment. This is a commendable purpose, which,
however, could have been accomplished without resorting to alteration of the
reporting date, since there is nothing in the Law or the Regulations which
precludes a claimant from appearing at the employment service prior to the date
set for reporting thereat, in order to inquire as to possible employment
opportunities.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant did not report to the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span

with the reporting requirements was false and known by him to be false. We are
of the opinion that claimant wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of
obtaining benefits within the meaning of the Law under the circumstances
appearing herein. The initial determination of the local office, holding that
claimant wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits
and imposing a forfeiture of 20 effective days, to be applied in reduction of

filed a claim under the Veteran’s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952,
effective July 5, 1954. By initial determination he was disqualified effective
July 19, because of refusal of employment without good cause. Claimant’s
employment prior to filing was a part-time nature, or vacation jobs. He was
honorably discharged from the Marine Corps. On August 3, 1952, and, from that
date until June 1954, had been attending college from which he received a BBA
degree in June 1954. On July 19 an employer who had interviewed claimant on
July 16 informed claimant that he would be hired immediately by the employer as
a typewriter salesman-trainee at $225 a month for three months. Claimant was
asked if he was willing to start immediately at 10 a.m. He stated he would but
that he had another job interview at 3:30 p.m. The employer thereupon withdrew
the offer and stated that he did not feel the claimant was sufficiently
interested in the job if he had another appointment that afternoon. Claimant’s
appointment for the afternoon did not result in employment but he has had three
interviews since that date with the employer, including one on the day of the
hearing, and there is a good possibility of his being hired by that employer as
a trainee-salesman of home products.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Although
we have adopted the referee’s findings of fact, we do not agree with his
conclusion based thereon that inasmuch as the prospective employer withdrew the
offer of employment when claimant indicated that he was to be interviewed by
another employer the same day regarding possible employment there was no
refusal of employment. Concededly, claimant had actually been hired by the
prospective employer on the date in question and had been instructed to report
for work immediately. If claimant had not then informed the employer that he
preferred not to report for work that day, as requested, because he had another
job prospect, he could have started work at once. The employer withdrew the offer
of employment solely because of such disclosure by claimant. Such information
was intended by claimant to discourage the employer from hiring him, at least
until claimant had had an opportunity to explore another job prospect. Claimant
at such time had no definite prospect of other employment, but merely a
possibility thereof which failed to materialize into employment. Claimant was
qualified by training and experience for the offered employment and there is no
question concerning the rate of pay being substantially less favorable to him
than that prevailing for similar work in the locality. Under the circumstances,
it must be deemed that claimant refused employment without good cause under the
Law. The initial determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from
receiving benefits effective July 19, 1954 on the ground that, without good
cause, he refused employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and
experience is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (November 12,
1954)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: No
hearing was held. The cases were decided on the basis of the stipulation by
claimants to be bound by the decision in Case 1-45-54R, the record of which is
incorporated herein. Claimants, store employees, last worked on March 6. By
initial determinations their respective benefits were suspended for seven weeks
effective March 8 for loss of employment due to an industrial controversy in
the establishment in which they were employed. The employer maintains a
warehouse at Colonie, where 75 percent of the retail store merchandise was
stored and from which deliveries were made to an area bounded roughly by Malone
on the north, Poughkeepsie on the south, Little Falls on the west and Albany on
the east. Although the employer packaged its own canned goods at plants
throughout the country, it shipped such merchandise to its centrally located
warehouse for transhipment to retail stores and, in its business discretion,
did not ship directly to the stores. Hard goods were shipped once a week. In
addition, there were daily shipments of baked good and dairy and fruit and
vegetable products were shipped by independent sources to the retail stores
directly several times per week. At Colonie, the employer occupied a U-shaped
building. The left wing was occupied by a bakery and the remainder of the
premises consisted of its regional offices and a warehouse. Trucks operated by
independent business enterprises exclusively for the employer picked up
merchandise at the warehouse and at the bakery for delivery to the retail
stores in the regional area. The bakery and warehouse were all under one roof.
At 3 p.m. on March 1, approximately 200 warehouse employees, members of a local
teamsters’ union, struck against the employer and placed picket lines around
the Colonie premises. Teamsters employed by the independent business enterprises
respected the picket lines. As a result, there could be no pickups and
deliveries of baked good or warehouse merchandise. J.B. was employed at a store
operated by the employer in East Greenbush and M.B. was employed in a store in
Hudson. These stores were physically separated from the premises in which the
warehouse employees worked. On March 5 the striking union placed a picket line
around the retail store located at East Greenbush and picketing continued at
least through the close of business on March 6. Because of the inability of the
employer to deliver merchandise to the stores, the premises were shut as of the
close of business on March 6. The employees were so notified and were laid off.
Were it not for the inability of the employer to obtain merchandise, the stores
would have remained in operation. There was no picketing at the Hudson store.
The strike of the warehouse employees was settled on March 24. The bakery and
store employees returned to work commencing March 25 and March 26, although the
retail stores were not to be open for business officially until noon of March
31.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee’s Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: It was
clear that the premises upon which claimants were employed were physically
separated by miles from the struck premises. As a matter of first impression it
therefore might appear that although their unemployment was caused by a strike,
the strike was not in their establishment. However, a similar question was
considered in Appeal Board 30,358-52. The Appeal Board ruled that by placing a
picket line at physically separated premises and the separate place of business
of the employer became the same establishment, which was struck. It follows
that by placing a picket line at the East Greenbush store the industrial
controversy was extended to those premises which became a part of the struck
establishment of the employer and J.B. lost his employment because of a strike
in the establishment in which he was employed. With reference to M.B., since no
picket line was placed around the Hudson store, the industrial controversy was
not extended to those premises. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Machcinski</u>, 277 App.
Div. 634, affirming Appeal Board, 20,456-49, and&nbsp;<u>Matter of Lasher</u>,
279 App. Div. 505, reversing Appeal Board 22,171-50, the principle was
established that in determining establishments &quot;the place where the
employee was last employed&quot; was the test to be used. Since M.B. worked in
a physically separated facility of the employer connected only with the struck
premises by the employer’s method of management, it was a separate
establishment from the struck establishment. Since the strike was not in her
establishment, her benefits may not be suspended. The initial determination
affecting J.B., as modified, is sustained. The initial determination affecting
M.B. is overruled.</span></p>

total unemployment and overpaid $15, since repaid. Her future benefits were
reduced by 24 effective days because of a wilful misrepresentation to obtain

that she worked a full day on Monday, November 2, and half days on Wednesday,
November 4, and Thursday, November 5, a total of 14 hours. Nevertheless, on
November 6, when she reported to the insurance office, she certified over her
signature that her then last day of work was November 5. On November 17, she
certified that in the week ending November 8, she had worked two days with
approximate earnings of $29. Claimant’s hourly rate on the basis of a 35-hour
week would have brought her weekly earnings for 14 hours to $29.60. Because of

from May 7 through May 13 and again from May 29 through June 4 because of loss
of employment due to a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed. S. and A. were ruled overpaid $30
each for the week ending May 6. Claimants were employed in various capacities
by a manufacturer of ladies' coats and suits. Commencing with the week ending
May 6, pressers stopped working because the piecework rate was not fixed to
their satisfaction. The other crafts were prevented from working because of the
tie-up in the employer's production. All returned to work on May 13 after a
tentative settlement. On May 28, a dispute arose between the pressers and the
employer; the pressers insisted on presenting their piecework tickets before
the garments were fully completed and the employer thought that this should not
be done. The pressers again stopped working and caused another stoppage. This
dispute was settled on June 4 and production in the employer's establishment
resumed immediately. Paragraph twentieth of the union agreement provided that
&quot;Workers shall not be required to work on garments before the piece rates
have been settled with respect thereto.&quot;</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimants and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimants are husband and wife, sewing-machine
operators on dresses, and refiled claims for benefits effective February 8,
1954. Initial determinations were issued to each disqualifying them for refusal
of employment, effective February 23. Claimants have been in this country for
five years. They had always worked as a team. The husband transacts all
business for himself and his wife. Originally they accepted employment on an $8
line of dresses. As they progressed in their skill, they advanced to a $10 line
in which their earnings were better and, finally, they progressed to a $16 line
with still higher earnings. They each earned approximately $80 a week.
Claimants work on a piecework basis in union shops, as they are union members.
The most usual piece rate paid to them is $1.30 to $1.70 for a complete
garment. Between them they make a complete garment. On March 23, claimants
refused employment on $8 garments because they were told that the piece rate
was 75 cents per garment. Because of the greater care with which they are
required to work on higher priced garments, they contend that they could not
earn more than 70 cents per hour whereas ordinarily they earn about $2 per
hour. The jobs were in a union shop and claimants would have worked as a team.
On March 2, claimants accepted employment on $10 garments, through the
employment office, worked on those garments for three weeks and earned from $45
to $55 weekly. They offer this as proof that they were over skilled for
employment on cheaper garments. Seeing that their earnings were less than they
were accustomed to make, they asked the employment office to refer them to
other employment, which was done immediately and they have been employed as of
approximately March 23 on $16 garments. Their earnings are $85 to $95 weekly.
The employment representative stated that there was no conversion involved,
merely a re-accommodation to new work and that, ordinarily, applicants with the
experience of these claimants are referred to work on garments in the $8 to $22
range.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee's Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>:
Ordinarily I would hold that these claimants should have tried the work before
refusing it, so that they could ascertain whether or not their earnings would be
considerably less than those to which they were accustomed and for which they
had the skill. But the evidence did establish that claimants were not arbitrary
in their refusal of employment on cheaper garments. Their previous experience
as well as that from March 2 to approximately March 23, was sufficient
indication that their earnings would be considerably depressed if they accepted
employment on cheaper garments. There may be claimants who can accommodate
themselves and have comparable earnings when employed on higher priced as well
as lower priced garments but, apparently, these claimants had acquired a
certain kind of skill which prevented them from earning what they were
accustomed to when employed on cheaper garments. Considering all the circumstances,
I hold that claimants refused employment with good cause in that they would
have had substantially less earnings in work for which they were overqualified.
The initial determination in each case is overruled.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;After
a careful review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the
referee, and due deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that
the referee's findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this
case, and that no errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the
findings of fact made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board,
except the Board finds additionally that the claimants refused the job offer in
question on February 23, 1954 instead of March 23, 1954 as inadvertently stated
in the referee's decision; that the usual method of compensation in the dress
line is on a piecework basis that the industry is 90 percent unionized and that
the piecework rate offered was fixed by agreement between the prospective
employer and the union of which claimants were members. In overruling the
initial determination of the local office that claimants' refusal of the
proffered employment was without good cause, the referee based this decision on
the premises that claimants' weekly earnings would be substantially reduced
from previous earnings by working on a lower priced garment because of the
particular skill and greater care which they acquired in the better priced line
and that they were overqualified for the employment offered. It has been
repeatedly held by the Board that a comparison of a claimant's previous weekly
earnings is not a proper test to determine whether the compensation offered
meets the requirements of the statute. The determination of the suitability of
a job offer so far as compensation in a particular job is concerned is to
compare the piecework rate offered to claimant with piecework rates being paid
for similar work in the locality. Claimants were offered employment in their
occupational classification. The piecework rate offered was the union rate
fixed by agreement with their union for the type of work and compared favorably
with that prevailing for similar work in the locality. Claimants were
reasonably fitted by training and experience for the employment offered.
Accordingly, the job offer met all the requirements of the statute and it
follows therefore that claimants' refusal of such offer merely because their
earnings would be less than their previous earnings is without good
cause.&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Helen Wetzig</u>, 304 N.Y. 916, affirming 279 App.
Div. 833, reversing Appeal Board, 27,749-51). The initial determinations of the
local office disqualifying claimants from receiving benefits effective February
23, 1954, on the ground that without good cause they refused employment for
which they are reasonably fitted by training and experience, are sustained. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (August 6, 1954)</span></p>

effective August 2 through August 15, she was ruled ineligible because of

called back to work on September 3. At the time of the layoff, she received

findings of fact made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board. The
Board makes the following additional findings of fact. Following claimant's
layoff on July 31, 1954, she at no time reported at the local office prior to
at least August 16. She did report on August 20 at which time her claim was
made effective August 16. Claimant made no attempt to seek information
regarding her eligibility for benefits during the period for which she was in
receipt of vacation pay. She chose to rely upon information which she
understood she received in the previous year under similar circumstances. When
filing for benefits effective August 16, 1954, claimant requested that her
claim be predated to August 2, 1954, which request was denied by the local
office. Although we have adopted the findings of fact made by the referee as
supplemented herein, we are not in accord with his disposition of this case,
overruling the initial determination of the local office holding claimant
ineligible to receive benefits for the period August 2, 1954 through August 15,
1954, on the ground that she failed to comply with registration requirements.
Concededly, claimant failed to attempt to elicit information regarding her
eligibility for benefits during the period in issue. Consequently, it cannot be
said that she was misled by information which she received at the local office.
Claimant chose to rely upon her interpretation of information furnished her
with respect to her eligibility for benefits in a previous year. Claimant has
furnished no adequate reason for her failure to week information respecting her
eligibility for benefits during the current year. Under such circumstances, the
predating of her claim is not warranted in this case. The initial determination
of the local office, holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective
August 2 through August 15, 1954, on the ground that she failed to comply with
registration requirements, is sustained. The decision of the referee is
reversed. (December 3, 1954)</span></p>

over 12 years experience in that trade. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
effective May 31, 1954 and registered for employment. On July 28, 1954 claimant
was referred to employment as a marine pipe fitter with a large shipyard. The
pay was $2.07 per hour. Claimant was not hired because he did not possess the
tools used in his occupation. He formerly owned such tools but they had been
stolen from him several months before on his last job. Claimant was able to
continue to work on that job because a fellow employee permitted him to use his
tools. A set of tools costs between $70 and $80. A marine pipe fitter is
customarily required to have his own tools. Claimant obtained employment for a
short time on August 11, as he applied for the job together with another pipe fitter
who did have tools which claimant could use on that job. Based on the
foregoing, the local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits effective July 28, 1954 on the ground that,
without good cause, he refused employment for which he is reasonably fitted by
training and experience or, in the alternative, holding him ineligible to
receive benefits effective the same date on the ground that he was unavailable
for employment. Claimant contested the determinations and requested a hearing
before a referee. The referee overruled both determinations and the Industrial
Commissioner appeals from such decision.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: We agree
with the conclusion of the referee that since claimant did not refuse the job
offer on July 28, he is not subject to a disqualification for refusal of
employment without good cause. However, we do not agree with the referee that
claimant was available for employment. While it may be true that claimant did
seek employment, a person in claimant’s occupation, without tools, is not able
to obtain employment unless a fellow employee is willing to permit him to use
his tools. A claimant is considered available only if he is ready, willing and
able to work in his usual employment or in any other for which he is reasonably
fitted by training and experience. Not only must the claimant intend and wish
to work, but there must be no circumstances which prevent him from accepting
employment or working. Considering all the circumstances including the extended
period of time that elapsed since claimant failed to replace his tools, the
local office properly held claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective
July 28, 1954, on the ground that he was unavailable for employment. The initial
determination of the local office, disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for refusal of employment without good cause, is overruled. The
alternative determination holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits
effective July 28, 1954 on the ground that he was unavailable for employment is
sustained as far as it relates to the period to August 15, 1954. The decision
of the referee is modified accordingly, and, as so modified, is affirmed.

was held at which claimant, her witness, and representative of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a sandwich girl, filed
for benefits effective March 30, 1954. By initial determination effective March
30, she was ruled ineligible because she was not totally unemployed. She was
ruled overpaid $121.50. Claimant has been seeking part-time work only. She has
been working on a part-time basis during the last two years. She and her
husband own a three-story house, and occupy the apartment in the basement. The
nine rooms upstairs are rented out to six roomers. The linens and the furniture
were provided by claimant. She cleaned the public halls, stairs, and the
bathrooms in the house, and also cleaned the rooms for two of the roomers. She
estimated that she spent an hour and a half in her cleaning duties. The income
from the roomers amounted to $42 a week.</span></p>

of Emery</u>, 281 App. Div. 426, aff'g Appeal Board, 30 879-52, it was held
that a claimant who is self-employed cannot be deemed totally unemployed within
the meaning of Section 522 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. However, the
Appeal Board held in Case 38,266-53 that the principle of the&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>&nbsp;case
did not apply to a claimant who rented out four rooms to help pay the cost of
maintaining her 14-room house. The problem in the present case is to determine
which of these two precedents is applicable. In my opinion the ruling of
the&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>&nbsp;case should govern. I recognize that the
self-employment involved in&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>&nbsp;was engaged in on
substantially a full-time basis, while in the instant case it was only
part-time. Nevertheless, the fact remains that it was a substantial business
activity rather than a mere appendage to claimant's household. On the contrary,
this was primarily a rooming house which claimant conducted for the purpose of
gaining a livelihood. She was therefore unable to satisfy the statutory
requirement that she be totally unemployed in order to be eligible for
benefits. The initial determination is sustained. Claimant was overpaid.</span></p>

concur with the conclusion of the referee that claimant had good cause to leave

employment. After the employer discontinued the night shift on which claimant
was employed she was offered similar work on the day shift. Claimant's refusal
to accept the daytime employment on the ground that she desired to work the
same hours as her husband is not good cause within the meaning of the Law since
claimant's declination was for reason of personal convenience and were not
compelling. Although the conditions of claimant's employment would have been
changed, she would not have been justified in refusing such employment in the
first instance. It, therefore, follows that claimant must be deemed to have
voluntarily left her employment without good cause. In view of the conclusion
reached herein, it is unnecessary for us to rule on the alternative initial
determination. The amended initial determination of the local office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days effective August 16,

used in the computation. According to the contract, the pay for the difference
between the number of hours actually worked and paid for and the guarantee of
2,000 hours of work will be the average rates paid when employed. Claimant has

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee's Opinion and Decision:</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;In
appeal Board 25,713-50, the Board faced an analogous but not identical
situation. In that case the employer also had a work plan whereby it guaranteed
qualified employees 140 hours or work in each month, the equivalent of four
weeks of 35 hours. According to that plan the employer also was specific in
what employees it considered qualified and under what conditions payments would
be discontinued. The guaranteed time was calculated once a month and was
included in pay for the week in which the last day of the month occurred. The
claimants in that case actually received benefits under the plan for certain
portions of the period for which they claimed unemployment insurance benefits.
In May 1950, they received a difference of 20 hours wages apparently having
worked 120 hours. They received similar differential wages for June and July
and September 1950. They had no employment apparently in October and November
of that year. During the layoff period they were permitted to seek and accept
employment elsewhere. Full benefits were paid them under the plan if they
worked part-time elsewhere. If they worked full-time elsewhere however, they
were paid on a pro-rata basis. It is evident that there is a substantial
difference of the plan cited from the plan herein. Claimant herein has received
no payment under the 2,000 hour annual work guarantee plan. She will receive no
payment until the employer will have ascertained as of October 1, 1954, what
her status of employment and unemployment has been. Further, claimant herein
may accept full-time employment elsewhere without failing to be a full
beneficiary under the plan. The plan becomes inoperative if the Company cannot
continue its operations because of a shortage of raw sugar or a repeal of
modification of a specific sugar act, or of labor disputes or of major
breakdowns, none of which can be reasonably anticipated but which could occur;
otherwise, no provision would have been made for their contingency. The plan is
subject to revision if the Company should close the refinery permanently. Such
closing may not be in sight but it can influence the payment of benefits under
the plan. It is these variations that distinguish the plan from that cited in
Appeal Board, 25,713-50. In said case in its conclusion the Appeal Board held
that</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;. . .
for the purposes of unemployment insurance the claimants cannot be regarded as
totally unemployed in any part of a month in which they received guaranteed
time under paragraph 2 of the plan. . . It would not be within the spirit of
the . . . Law to award to these claimants unemployment insurance benefits to
supplement their earnings in the months during which they had some employment
with the employer and were paid by the employer for the minimum hours of work
contemplated by the parties. . .&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;. . .
a reasonable construction of the statute . . . permits a holding that each
claimant is entitled to be credited with two statutory weeks of total
unemployment in any month in which she was unemployed and received from the
employer 70 hours lay off pay . . .&quot; (the maximum under the plan)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The plan of the employer herein
guarantees 2,000 hours of work per annum and pay for the difference between the
number of hours and the number of actual regular hours worked including hours
for which vacation and holiday pay was granted. The employer's work week
consists of 40 hours. Thus the equivalent of 2,000 hours is 50 weeks work, so
that no employee will be paid for at least two weeks of unemployment in the
period October 1, 1953 to October 1, 1954. Claimant is therefore in any event
entitled to unemployment insurance benefits for at least two weeks of her
current unemployment. For these she will not receive compensation under the
employer's guaranteed work plan. As for the remaining weeks in the current
period of unemployment claimant has received no remuneration from the employer.
Her receipt of remuneration under the plan depends upon many future
contingencies. Any of the contingencies will affect and diminish claimant's
right to benefits under the plan. Since it cannot be determined at this time to
what extent claimant will be a beneficiary and whether she will profit under
the plan for her present weeks of unemployment, she is entitled to unemployment
insurance benefits as being totally unemployed. However, if in the future
claimant receives remuneration under the plan for any of the weeks for which
unemployment insurance benefits will have been paid to her, she must then be
deemed to have been not totally unemployed, with the exclusion of the two weeks
period indicated. Any such retroactive determination will have the effect of
ruling claimant ineligible for the periods except the two weeks noted.</span></p>

After a careful review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the
referee, and due deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that
the referee's findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this
case, and that no errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the
findings of fact made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board. The
Board makes the following additional findings of fact: Claimant was recalled to
work on June 9, 1954 and was continuously employed through September 26, 1954.
Claimant received from her employer compensation in the sum of $3,291.65 for
the period from October 1, 1953 through September 30, 1954. The said sum
included payment by the employer for 320 hours during which no work was performed,
pursuant to the contract between the employer and the union. During the said
period claimant actually worked 1,549½ hours, was enjoying paid holidays for 72
working hours, and was on paid vacation for 64 working hours during the two
weeks ending April 4,1954. Between October 7, 1953 ad the week ending March 28,
1954, claimant was offered, in addition to work actually performed, the
opportunity for additional work by reason of her seniority privilege, amounting
to 34½ hours, which claimant was either unwilling or, for personal reasons,
unable to accept. Claimant was recalled to work during November 1954 and was
still employed on November 30, 1954, the date of the hearing before the Board.
Claimant, not having been on the employer's active payroll as of October 1,
1954, is ineligible as a potential beneficiary with regard to guaranteed
employment under the new contract between claimant's union and her employer
effective that date. The referee concluded that claimant was totally unemployed
because as of the date of the hearing before him claimant had not received any
payments from her employer covering the period in issue and further because of
the possibility that none would be paid to her by reason of the happening of
various contingencies provided for in the union contract. The evidence now
before the Board clearly establishes none of the contingencies which might
possibly operate to defeat claimant's right to the payment of benefits under
the contract has occurred and that she has in fact received compensation
thereunder from her employer for the period in issue. Claimant was in effect on
a paid leave of absence during the period for which unemployment insurance
benefits were claimed and she was consequently not totally unemployed within
the meaning of the Law. Regulations of the Industrial Commissioner, Section
2(g), provide that a week of employment includes any statutory week during any
part of which an employee is on paid vacation or other paid leave of absence
even though no actual work is performed. The initial determination of the local
office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective May 3, 1954 on
the ground that she was not totally unemployed is sustained. The decision of
the referee is reversed. (December 10, 1954)</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>It should be noted that where a
claimant has not as yet received remuneration under a guaranteed wage plan, but
such payment may be due at a later date depending upon future contingencies,
claimant will be entitled to unemployment insurance benefits as being totally
unemployed. However, in the event that claimant subsequently receives
remuneration for a period during which benefits were paid, a retroactive
determination should be issued holding claimant ineligible for the period
covered by such payment.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the
Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant filed for benefits
effective August 23, 1954. By initial determination effective the same date,
she was disqualified for 42 days of voluntary leaving of employment without
good cause. By alternative initial determination, she was ruled ineligible
effective August 23 because of unavailability for employment. Claimant worked
for the employer from 1946 to August 20, 1954. In April 1953 she was made a
staff section head at $64.25 a week. She previously worked as a stock control
clerk at $59.25. Her terminal salary as a section head was $66.26. Her
employment terminated because of reorganization. She was offered employment as
a stock control clerk at $59.75 but refused that job because of the reduction
in wages and the fact that her period of employment as a section head would not
count in her seniority. Claimant, prior to September 13, sought work as a
section head in a department store. She made only two or three employer
contacts during that period because she believed that there would be no chance
of getting such employment unless the employer advertised. Starting with
September 13 she applied to several employers each week. She was then willing
to work as a section head or a stock control clerk.</span></p>

available for employment prior to September 13. During that period she made a

fitted by training and experience. Subsequent thereto, she met the test of
availability under the Unemployment Insurance Law because she made an active
and diligent search for employment and was willing to accept any employment for
which she was qualified. The initial determination of voluntary leaving of
employment is overruled. The alternative determination of unavailability is
modified to be effective through September 12, and as modified, is sustained.</span></p>

been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law
made by the referee as the findings of fact and conclusion of law of this
Board, except as otherwise indicated herein and except that we make the
following additional findings of fact: Claimant's loss of employment was
occasioned by the elimination of the position of staff section head in her
department as a result of a re-organization. The employer's action in
eliminating this position was not arbitrary but was done in the usual course of
its business operations. Claimant was offered employment as stock control clerk
at a salary of $61.75 a week. Her principal reason for refusing to accept this
position was because she preferred the job of section head or any other
non-union position. She would have accepted transfer to a position not
involving union membership, even at a reduction in salary. The rate of pay
offered claimant was not substantially less favorable to claimant than that
prevailing in the locality for similar work. Claimant was fitted by training
and experience for the employment offered to her. At the time she left her
employment, claimant had no prospect of immediate other employment. The job of
section head which claimant desired was not available at the time claimant left
her employment. The Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper
findings of fact and correctly determined the issue involved in this case,
except as above supplemented and as otherwise stated herein. We find that the
reasons given by claimant for leaving her employment do not constitute good
cause within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The initial
determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 consecutive days effective August 23, 1954 on the ground that
she voluntarily left her employment without good cause is sustained. The
decision of the referee insofar as appealed from is reversed. (January 7, 1955)</span></p>

effective December 28, 1953. By initial determination effective the same date,
he was ruled ineligible because of lack of total unemployment. He was ruled
overpaid $360. Claimant was employed for eight years to November 1953, by a
manufacturer of gloves and was laid off because of lack of work. Previous
thereto, he was employed for 17 years as foreman in the dye house of a knitting
mill. In March 1953, claimant was elected a trustee of the village of
Broadalbin. His election was for a two-year term, April 1, 1953 through March
31, 1955. In February 1954, he was paid $100 for the fiscal year April 1, 1953
through March 31, 1954. There are four trustees, and at the first annual
meeting the Mayor of the village appoints each of the trustees as Commissioner
of Street, Lighting, Police, and Sidewalks, respectively. Claimant was
appointed Lighting Commissioner for the year April 1953 to April 1954. Meetings
are held in the evening of the third Tuesday of each month and last
approximately one hour. During these meetings, village business is discussed,
including various complaints received concerning streets, etc. Attendance at
the meetings is not compulsory. The trustees must approve the annual budget as
compiled by the Mayor, the Village Clerk, and the Village Treasurer. Two
trustees must sign all vouchers for payment of village employees. Claimant is
also required to attend emergency meetings, of which there were two during his
first year in office. After receiving information through an article in the
local newspaper that a Justice of the Peace had been disqualified from
receiving unemployment insurance benefits on the basis that he lacked total
unemployment, while holding an elective office, claimant, on April 4, 1954 went
to the insurance office and informed it that he was a village trustee and was
receiving $100 a year. After receiving notice of disqualification, on April 6,
claimant resigned his office as trustee, effective April 7. He was allowed to
file a valid original claim effective April 8. He was recalled to work by his
last employer on April 19.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Board makes the following
additional findings of fact: The referee sustained the initial determination of

referee ruled by virtue of his office as a village trustee, claimant may not be
considered as totally unemployed during the term of his office and he sustained
the initial determination. The Board recently had occasion to pass on a similar
situation and we held to the opposite effect. The following language in Appeal
Board, 45,327-54, which involved a village trustee who received $150 a year,
applies equally to the facts in the instant case:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>There is no
evidence that claimant actually performed any other official duties than those
which could be performed by him at the regular monthly meeting or at the
emergency meetings of the Village Board of Trustees. Any business pertaining to
the village affairs could be transacted without the claimant as his presence at
the meetings was not necessary to constitute a quorum and, in fact, he did not
even attend all of the meetings. At no time did the performance of his official
duties interfere with claimant's availability for other employment. We are of
the opinion that the $150 received annually by claimant was in effect paid to
him for the performance of such duties as he performed when he attended the
meetings of the Village Board and that only on those occasions was claimant not
totally unemployed. The Appeal Board decisions, involving the ward supervisor,
the town clerk and the truant officer, relied on by the referee, are
distinguishable from the instant case. There was evidence in those cases that
the claimants were performing services of a continuous nature, in that they
were called to perform their official duties from day to day. Such does not
appear to be the situation here, and consequently those decisions are not
determinative of the issue in the instant case. Thus, we find that only on
those days when claimant attended meetings of the Village Board of Trustees was
he was not totally unemployed. Since the record does not disclose the number of
meetings attended by claimant during the period for which he was paid benefits,
this case is returned to the local office for further inquiry and a new
determination in accordance with this decision.</span></p>

extent that claimant was not totally unemployed only on those specific days
when he attended meetings of the Village Board. The amount of the overpayment
should be recomputed accordingly. This case is returned to the local office in
accordance with the foregoing opinion. The decision of the referee is modified
accordingly and, as so modified, is affirmed. (January 14, 1955)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a hand bookkeeper, filed effective November
22, 1954. By initial determination, he was ruled ineligible through December 15
because of lack of total unemployment. Claimant was employed for about four and
a half years up to November 19, 1954, at $250 monthly. He received his pay on
the first and 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of each month. On November 19, the assistant
secretary of the firm informed claimant and about 14 other hand bookkeepers
that because of the installation of a machine bookkeeping system, their
services would no longer be required. The employer, in order &quot;to lessen
the shock of unemployment, particularly at that time of the year - 'goodwill'
gesture, and in keeping generally with our termination policy,&quot; thereafter
sent claimant his semi-monthly pay checks on December 1 and December 15, less
the usual deductions. The employer reported that claimant was kept &quot;on the
payroll&quot;, but it certified that the last two payments were in the nature
of a separation wage, that he was privileged to seek and accept employment
elsewhere, and that he was not subject to recall. Its termination policy provided
for payments based on length of service prior to the termination. In this case,
however, because several employees were involved, &quot;we arranged to let them
go on November 19 and pay each of them to December 15 regardless of length of
service.&quot; Claimant had received his annual vacation in July and no further
vacation was due him as of November 19.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee's Opinion and decision:</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;I am
unable to conclude that claimant lacked total unemployment during any part of
his reporting period. The employment relationship between claimant and his
employer was terminated on November 19 and the payments thereafter made did not
revive it. In my opinion, any allocation of the two paychecks to any period
subsequent to November 19 was no more than a bookkeeping device of the
employer. It was conceded upon the record that absent (sic) the employer's
allocation of the two checks through the payroll periods ending December 15,
claimant's status as totally unemployed would not have been affected by the
payments. The two checks were given to claimant as a bonus and therefore did
not adversely affect claimant's status as totally unemployed. (<u>Matter of
Levy</u>, 279 App. Div. 947, aff'd 304 N.Y. 823, aff'g Appeal Board,
21,600-49). The initial determination is overruled. (January 20, 1955)</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The fact that a claimant is
&quot;kept on the payroll&quot; of the employer following discharge in order to
receive dismissal or separation wages is insufficient, of itself, to warrant a
determination that claimant is employed. The question presented in such cases
is whether the employer-employee relationship continues during the period that
the claimant receives compensation without work. Experience indicates that in
the majority of such cases, as here, claimant is in fact discharged, the
employer-employee relationship discontinued and claimant is kept on the payroll
solely as a bookkeeping device to receive separation or dismissal payments.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>However, if it can be shown that
claimant is not in fact discharged at the time work ceases, but such discharge
is effective when separation wages terminate, there is no alternative but to
hold claimant&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;totally unemployed during the period covered
by the dismissal payments. Evidence of the continuation of the
employer-employee relationship may be indicated in various ways. For example,
claimant may be subject to recall during the period that he receives dismissal
payments or he may be precluded from seeking or accepting other employment
during such period. Also, an unequivocal statement may be made by the employer
that the employer-employee relationship continues through the period covered by
the dismissal payments, and claimant's discharge is not to be effective until
the dismissal payments cease.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

worked intermittently from December 1953 to March 10, 1954 as a relief
counterman in New York City on the shift from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. for an employer
which operated a chain of cafeterias. He reported at the employer's main office
at 6 p.m. each night and worked only if needed. He sometimes waited until 9
p.m. to ascertain whether work was available for him that night at any of its
13 cafeterias in the locality. He was hired to work in a cafeteria for a single
night only if a regular counterman had a day off or was absent from work due to
other reasons. He was not paid for waiting at the main office for work.
Claimant worked about one or two nights a week and earned from $8 to $10 a day.
During some periods he had no work for as many as 11 days. His regular
occupation was that of an accountant. Claimant reported to the employer's
office each night from March 10 to March 15, 1954 but there was no work for
him. Shortly thereafter he returned to his family in New Britain, Connecticut,
where he filed a claim for benefits against New York as the liable state effective
July 5, 1954 and reported to July 20, 1954. He obtained employment on July 21,
1954. The Out-of-State Resident Office issued an initial determination
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days

therefrom to the Board.</span></p>

referee sustained the determination on the premise that claimant's reasons for

on a daily &quot;shape-up&quot; basis and whether he would be given work as a
relief counterman on any day was contingent upon the absence of any of the
regular countermen at the employer's cafeterias. It cannot be said that
claimant had any employment to leave in New York City and at the most he might
have continued to receive work occasionally as a relief counterman on a day to
day basis. Under these circumstances we hold that claimant did not voluntarily
leave employment within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law (<u>Matter

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimant,
a working foreman-upholsterer, was thus employed with his last employer for
approximately two years to September 16, 1954. Originally claimant was
compensated at the rate of $150 per week plus $20 weekly for automobile
expense. Subsequently he agreed to work on an hourly basis at $3.25 per hour. On
September 16, 1954, claimant’s employer criticized the manner in which claimant
was upholstering a sofa. The employer insisted that claimant re-do the sofa in
accordance with the employer’s instructions. Claimant indicated a reluctance to
comply with such instructions. Whereupon, he was informed that unless he
performed the work as directed, he could leave the job. He thereupon
voluntarily left his employment. Claimant filed for benefits, effective
September 20, 1954, and registered for employment. Based on an interview with
the claimant and a report received from the employer, the local office issued
an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42
consecutive days, effective September 20, 1954, on the ground that he voluntarily
left his employment without good cause. Claimant requested a hearing, and the
referee overruled the initial determination. The Industrial Commissioner
appealed to this Board.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: In
overruling the initial determination, the referee concluded that the actions of
the employer were designed to compel the claimant to resign, and held that he
was improperly disqualified for voluntarily leaving his employment without good
cause. We are not in accord with this view. Claimant testified that the reason
he left his employment was due to his refusal to accept the employer’s
criticism of his work, and that he was unwilling to reupholster the sofa in a
way that would be satisfactory to the employer. There is no evidence that
claimant’s wages would have been reduced if he had carried out the employer’s
orders. There may be merit to claimant’s contention that to do so would have
resulted in a poor job. However, that was the concern of the employer, and
claimant’s leaving of his employment under these circumstances was without good
cause within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. (Appeal Board,
34,278-52.) The initial determination of the local office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days, effective September
20, 1954, on the ground that he voluntarily left his employment without good
cause, is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (February 11,

Claimants H.P., L.A.G., J.S. and R.J.J. appeal from that part of the decision
overruling the initial determinations of the local offices holding them
eligible to receive benefits effective May 27, 1954 without disqualifying
conditions and sustaining the employer’s objections that claimants were
ineligible to receive benefits on the ground that they were unavailable for
employment and charging them with overpayments in benefits. The other claimants
appeal from the decision of the referee insofar as it modifies the initial
determinations of the local offices holding them eligible to receive benefits
effective May 27, 1954 by ruling that such claimants were unavailable for
employment for various periods, that they were overpaid in benefits and
sustaining in part the employer’s objections. The employer U-F. Inc. appeals
insofar as the referee sustained the initial determinations of the local
offices holding claimants H.W. and A.L. eligible to receive benefits effective
May 27,1954 as modified by the referee to hold that claimants were unavailable
for employment effective May 27, 1954 and available effective June 9, 1954 and

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimants
were employed as retail sales clerks in furniture stores located in Albany and
Troy, New York. A strike was called by claimants’ union on April 8,1954. The
seven-week industrial controversy suspension took effect and continued through
May 26,1954. Claimants filed original claims for benefits effective May 27,
1954. Prior to their applications for benefits, the employers had notified
claimants that they had been replaced in their jobs. A group of strikers,
including some of the claimants, had visited one of the employers and asked to
be reinstated, but their requests were denied. The union has a &quot;strike and
defense fund&quot; maintained by union dues. Most of the claimants spent
considerable time picketing the employers’ stores for which they received $25
per week from the fund during the period of their unemployment. Such picketing
was done on a voluntary basis, no fixed amount of picketing was required and
the time spent on the picket line was arranged among the strikers. Two of the
claimants received union benefits for weeks during which they did not picket.
All claimants were ready and willing to abandon their picketing to accept
employment. They reported at the respective local offices as required and
signified their willingness to accept employment. They were interviewed
concerning any possible restrictions and their efforts to obtain work. As a
result of the interviews, they were deemed available for and capable of
employment effective May 27, 1954 and benefits were authorized and paid to them
by the local offices for various periods until the employers filed objections.</span></p>

that certain claimants were not totally unemployed, since they had other work

to claimants H.P., L.A.G., J.S. and R.J.J. and sustained the employer’s
objections that they were ineligible to receive benefits because they were
unavailable for employment. The referee modified the initial determinations of
the local offices as to the remaining claimants by ruling that such claimants
were unavailable for employment for various periods and sustaining in part the
employer’s objections that claimants were ineligible to receive benefits
because they were unavailable for employment. As to four of the claimants, he
remitted the mater to the local offices to determine claimants’ availability on
and after various dates. He further held that claimants were overpaid in
benefits and he remitted to the local offices the question of determining the
recoverability of such overpayments. Claimants appealed to the Board insofar as
the referee either modified or overruled the initial determinations of the
local offices and charged them with overpayments in benefits. The employer U-F.
Inc. appealed to the Board insofar as the decision sustained the initial
determinations of the local offices to the extent of holding claimants H.W. and

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee properly overruled the objections interposed by the employer that
claimants were not totally unemployed because they were picketing the
employers’ premises and receiving remuneration therefor. He overruled also
further objections of the employer that certain claimants were ineligible for
benefits because they had other employment and that two of the claimants had
refused offers of employment. No appeal was taken from this portion of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimants appeal herein insofar as
the referee held them unavailable for employment effective May 27, 1954 and for

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Whether one
is &quot;available for work to engage in his usual employment or in any other
for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience&quot;, within the
meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law (section 522), depends to a large
extent upon the facts and circumstances in each case (Appeal Board, 8745-43;
affirmed in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Maude May Smith</u>, 267 App. Div. 468).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although
not susceptible of a precise definition, we have long held the phrase
&quot;available for work&quot; to mean a claimant’s readiness, willingness and
ability to continue to perform work for which he is reasonably fitted by
training and experience (Appeal Board, 2065-40; 2717-40; 5540-410). When a
claimant’s readiness and willingness to accept work is brought into question by
his conduct or other facts indicating possible unavailability, the present or
absence of efforts to obtain employment, other than merely registering with the
employment service as required, constitute overt acts indicative of a
claimant’s state of mind, and is competent evidence to be judged in determining
the probability of a claimant’s assertions in the light of the established and
admitted facts and other relevant factors and circumstances (Appeal Board,
6759-42)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The fact
that some employers are reluctant to hire aged, though physically capable
workers, does not in and of itself make them unavailable for employment (Appeal
Board, 9975-43). The test, we have held is not the availability of work for the
claimant, but the availability of the claimant for work (Appeal Board,
12,626-46; 17,200-48; 23,041-40).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The referee in this case ruled that
availability of each claimant must be tested by his efforts to find work. He
then proceeded to dispose of the issue as to each individual claimant on the
sole basis of the number of their contacts for work. No consideration appears
to have been given to other relevant factors and circumstances relating to the
issue nor was any attempt made to evaluate the nature of efficacy of such work
efforts as bearing on the state of mind or attitude toward work of each
claimant. We know of no authority for such a rule or for such procedure. We do
not believe that any formula can be devised which may be so applied with mathematical
precision as a test of availability.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Looking at this group of claimants
as a whole, we find certain facts which are common to each and which cannot be
overlooked in judging their availability for work. Although the referee ruled
that the voluntary picket line formed by the claimants did not prevent them
from being totally unemployed, he failed to take into account that by the same
token a claimant who seeks through recognized means to obtain better working
conditions on his job from his employer, strongly suggests an attachment to the
labor market (See appeal Board, 27,617-51). Likewise, the claimants’ attempt to
return to their former jobs by requesting re-employment was a further
manifestation of their attachment to the labor market and their availability
for work.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Further, there is no question in
this case but that claimants were willing and ready to accept work without
unreasonable restrictions during the period in question. Claimants reported as
required to the state employment office; they were interviewed and satisfied
the authorities that they were genuinely desirous of work and had maintained
their attachment to the labor market. They were exposed to the reservoir of
employment opportunities afforded by that office and none of them ever refused
to accept a referral to employment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimants sought work. Their
inability to find work cannot be used as a basis to establish that they were
unavailable for work. We accordingly hold that claimants, having complied with
all of the provisions of the law and having met the tests laid down by the
statute and the Commissioner’s regulations, were available for employment
effective May 27, 1954 and are entitled to retain the benefits received.</span></p>

requested and received a six months' leave of absence to operate a restaurant
in a resort area for the summer season. Claimant was promised return to her
usual work at the end of her leave if work was available. The business was not
successful and claimant closed the restaurant on September 19, 1954. On
September 27, 1954 she applied to her employer for her former job and was told
that work was slack but that she would be recalled in a short time. Claimant
then filed an application for benefits effective September 27, 1954. On October
12, 1954 the employer notified claimant that she was to report to work on
October 25, 1954. Claimant has been employed since that date on an alternate
week basis. The local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 days effective September 27, 1954 on

protested and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: We agree
with the referee's conclusion that claimant was not subject to disqualification
for voluntarily leaving her employment without good cause. The record
establishes that claimant did not sever the employment relationship, but had
been promised re-employment at her usual work after the summer season. It is
clear that claimant had no intention to quit her job. The cases cited by the
Industrial Commissioner in his brief are not in point as they involve claimants
who voluntarily terminated their employment relationships with their employers
and who would otherwise have still remained employed on their jobs at the times
of their applications for benefits. Appeal Board, 20,402-49 which involved a
claimant who had taken a temporary leave from her employment because of illness
in the family and could not obtain re-employment upon her return because of the
closing of the employer's plant, we said:</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In any
event when claimant fled for benefits on February 4, 1949, her lack of
employment on that day was not due to her leaving, but to the fact that the
employer's establishment had ceased operating, a circumstance over which the
claimant had no control. Under such circumstances we believe that the claimant
did not voluntarily leave her employment.</span></p>

a biller, was thus employed with an interstate trucking firm, until September
20, 1954, when he was laid off. The employer's main office and operating
headquarters are located in Birmingham, Alabama. The employer is engaged in
interstate truck transportation. For some time prior to September 20, 1954 the
employer was in negotiation with the labor union representing its over-the-road
drivers. The latter were dispatched from the employer's headquarters in
Birmingham, and made deliveries to various termini located throughout the
United States. The employer maintained a terminal in New York City, where
claimant was employed. None of the over-the-road drivers in the employ of the
employer was attached to its New York terminal. On September 17, 1954, a work
stoppage occurred at the employer's headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. By
September 20, 1954, the stoppage had affected the operations of the employer's
entire system. Because no shipments were being received for local delivery, the
New York terminal was shut down, except for the receipt of telephone messages,
collection of bills due, etc. All employees employed therein including claimant
were laid off except a few persons who were retained for the aforesaid
purposes. Neither the claimant nor any of the other employees connected with
the employer's New York terminal took part in the work stoppage nor were they
concerned with the industrial controversy. At all times they were ready and
willing to continue work. They were not members of the labor union involved in
the controversy with the employer. No pickets were posted at the New York
terminal nor was there any other evidence of the existence of an industrial
controversy involving the employer's New York office. On October 18, 1954, an
agreement was reached with the labor union representing the over-the-road
drivers and the New York terminal was reopened for normal business operation on
October 22, 1954. The layoff which occurred at the New York office during the
pendency of the controversy resulted from instructions issued at the employer's
headquarters in Alabama. Claimant was recalled by the employer on October 20,
1954. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective September 20, 1954, and
registered for employment. Based on an interview with the claimant, the local
office issued an initial determination suspending the accumulation of benefit
rights by the claimant during a period of seven consecutive weeks, effective
September 21, 1954, on the ground that he lost his employment because of a
strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which
he was employed. Claimant requested a hearing and the referee sustained the
initial determination. Claimant appealed to this Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee, in sustaining the initial determination, concluded that claimant lost
his employment because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in
which he was employed. We are not in accord with this view. The word
&quot;establishment&quot; as used in the Law means the place where an employee
was last employed. The Legislature never intended that
&quot;establishment&quot; was to include all plants of an employer situated in
many states throughout the country. The employer's New York terminal was a
separate establishment from the standpoint of employment. The problem here
involved is not whether the various branches of the employer's business,
situated in different states, are to be considered a single establishment from
the standpoint of management. In construing Section 592.1 of the Law, as to
whether or not the claimant lost his employment as a result of an industrial
controversy, the subject is to be approached from the standpoint of employment
rather than management (<u>Matter of Machcinski</u>, et al, 277 App. Div. 634,
affirming Appeal Board, 20,456-49, etc.). Applying this test to the instant
case, we conclude that the claimant did not lose his employment as a result of
an industrial controversy in the establishment in which he was employed.
Consequently, he is not subject to the suspension imposed. The initial
determination of the local office suspending the accumulation of benefit rights
by the claimant during a period of seven consecutive weeks, effective September
21, 1954, on the ground that he lost his employment because of a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which he was
employed is overruled. The decision of the referee is reversed. (February 25,
1955)</span></p>

were made weekly. The union, during this period, was subject to the

not binding upon the facts herein. In Appeal Board 9940-43, the issue was related
to the status of officers of a labor organization. The constitution of this
organization provided that members were to be compensated for time spent in
connection with the administration of the association and that such
compensation should be computed at the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay.
It also provided that the treasurer was to receive $50 per year, all district
committee chairmen and district committee secretaries $10 per year, in addition
to compensation for time.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

the remuneration paid to the officers for work performed during their leisure

applications as indicated herein above were limited solely to compensation paid
to the officers of the associations, we make no disposition herein regarding
the status of the persons other than such officers.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

of the Attorney General was likewise cited by the Appeal Board in 10,085-43. In
that case, the findings of fact indicate that the officers under discussion
only devoted so much of their time to the fraternal organization as suited
their convenience. The Board found that the compensation received by them was
not wages but rather in the nature of a reward and that the duties performed by
these officers were not pursuant to any trade or calling normally engaged in by
them.</span></p>

Court of Appeals, in reversing that ruling, merely stated that it could not
state as a matter of law that the finding by the Appeal Board that the officers

an actress, has been connected with the theatre since about 1945, at which time
she became a member of a professional group of radio and television artists. In
1952 she became a member of a professional society of screen actors. She is
listed as an actress in the professional actor’s directory. Claimant from time
to time performed part-time, temporary clerical work under a flexible schedule
of hours which permitted her to visit the offices of casting directors,
producers and prospective employers whenever the latter would allow claimant an
interview. This is one of the customary methods of search for employment in the
acting profession. In the last of her clerical employment claimant earned
$322.41 from February 29 through July 25, 1952 and $646.51 from January 13
through June 25, 1953. She had no clerical employment thereafter. As a result
of previous interviews claimant obtained employment as a television actress on
June 26, as a motion picture actress on June 29 and as a television actress on
July 3, 1953, for one day in each instance. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
effective July 6, 1953 and registered for employment. She was classified by the
employment service as an actress, with future reporting date permanently
deferred, since the employment service does not undertake to secure employment
for actors. Since filing her claim for benefits claimant made a diligent search
for employment as an actress and obtained employment in that field on the
following days: July 22,1953, television program; August 12, 1953, motion
picture, September 15, 1953, television program; September 30, 1953, radio
program; October 3 and 4, 1953, motion picture; October 15, 1953,motion
picture. Based on an interview with claimant, during the course of which she
restricted herself to employment as an actress, the local office, on August 19,
issued an initial determination holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits
effective July 6, 1953 on the ground that she was unavailable for employment.
On August 21 the local office directed claimant to report to the employment
service to be reclassified as a typist-receptionist. Claimant at that time
restated her restriction to the acting field, requested a hearing before the
referee on the issue of availability, and indicated that she would report to
the employment service for reclassification in the event the referee’s decision
was adverse to her. The referee overruled the initial determination and the
Industrial Commissioner has appealed to this Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee’s conclusion that claimant exerted diligent efforts to obtain
employment as an actress is supported by the record. Claimant was justified in
continuing her search for such employment after filing her claim in view of the
occupational classification of actress assigned by the employment service and
success in obtaining theatrical engagements after leaving her clerical
employment. Claimant was therefore available for employment from and after the
date on which her claim for benefits was filed until August 21, 1953, when claimant
refused to report to the employment service as directed. By so doing she
rendered herself unavailable for employment within the meaning of the Law. The
initial determination of the local office holding claimant ineligible to
receive benefits effective July 6, 1953 is hereby modified so as to make the
same effective August 21, 1953, rather than as originally issued and, as so
modified, is sustained. The decision of the referee is modified accordingly
and, as so modified is affirmed. (January 29,1954)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: During
her base year (July 7, 1952 through July 5, 1953) claimant was employed for a
period of twenty-two weeks as a receptionist, working for an agency which
supplied stenographers, typists and receptionists to others on a temporary
basis. There was work of that type available to her through the same employer
during the period for which she is seeking unemployment insurance benefits.
Claimant preferred, however, to seek work as an actress, for which she was
trained and qualified, and declined classification as a typist or receptionist.
When claimant filed for benefits effective on July 6, 1953, she was classified
as an actress and future reporting date was deferred, because the employment
service does not undertake to security employment for actors. She diligently
sought work as an actress and obtained temporary employment on infrequent
occasions for one day. It was disclosed on interviews that claimant restricted
her availability for employment exclusively to employment as an actress and
refused to report on August 21, 1953, as directed, for reclassification as a
typist-receptionist. The Appeal Board has held that she was entitled to
benefits from July 6, 1953 to August 21, 1953, and from that portion of the
decision the Commissioner appeals. The Board has disqualified claimant, on the
ground that she was unavailable for employment, after August 21,1953, when she
refused reclassification, and from that portion of the decision claimant
cross-appeals. We may not say as a matter of law that the record does not
sustain the Board’s decision as to both periods. Although claimant truthfully
listed her occupation as an actress and sought work only in that profession
during the first period mentioned, it does not appear that she refused other
work or other classification during that period. It was within the province of
the Board to find that she was available for employment. After she refused
reclassification when work as a typist-receptionist was available, however, she
rendered herself unavailable for employment within the meaning of the law. The
Unemployment Insurance Law was intended for and expressly covers only those who
are totally unemployed through no fault of their own and &quot;no benefits
shall be payable to any claimant who is not ready, willing and able to work in
his usual employment&nbsp;<u>or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted
by training and experience</u>.&quot; (Labor Law, §591). (Emphasis supplied).
Whether claimant’s &quot;usual employment&quot; be that of a
typist-receptionist or an actress, it is without dispute that she was
&quot;reasonably fitted by training and experience&quot; for employment as a
typist-receptionist, and her refusal to seek or accept classification for which
employment clearly brings her within the category of those to whom the statute
mandates &quot;No benefits shall be payable.&quot; The statute clearly outlines
the conditions to be met and they may not be modified because an applicant
desires to exclusively pursue a career, which is more attractive. &quot;Where a
person is reasonably fitted for more than one kind of employment he does not
bring himself within the benefits provided by the statute if he refuses one
kind merely because he prefers the other.&quot; (<u>Matter of Delgado</u>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<u>Corsi</u>,
278 App. Div. 237). See&nbsp;<u>Matter of Boyle</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>), (277
App. Div. 1155);&nbsp;<u>Matter of Gilbert</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>), (278 App.
Div. 733);&nbsp;<u>Matter of Pillersdorff</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>), (278 App.
Div. 57). It is urged that claimant’s previous employment as a
typist-receptionist was merely a &quot;stop gap&quot; employment necessary to
further her career. The record discloses that between January 1951 and June 23,
1953, claimant had sixty-six weeks employment as a typist-receptionist and only
five days of paid employment as an actress. Though other employment might
interfere with her efforts to gain employment as an actress, the immediate
prospect of finding substantial and regular employment in that field is too
remote to constitute a just cause for refusing other employment. Claimant may
not exclusively pursue her chosen career at the expense of unemployment
contributions made by others. In so doing she removes herself from the spirit,
purpose and letter of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The decision of the

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant, his witness and a representative of his employer
appeared and testified. A statement was submitted on behalf of the Industrial
Commissioner in lieu of an appearance. Claimant, an optician, filed for
benefits on October 22 effective October 18, 1954. By initial determination
effective October 18 he was disqualified for 42 days for voluntarily leaving
employment without good cause. He filed a new claim effective November 29 and
on this filing was held not to have filed a valid original claim because he had
only 18 weeks of employment in the applicable base period. The initial
determination of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause was mailed
to claimant on November 5. He executed a formal request for hearing on December
7. A preliminary objection has been raised that claimant’s request was not
timely. Claimant worked for the same employer for over 25 years to April 1954.
He then desired a leave of absence because he had received word that his aged
mother was seriously ill abroad and he was anxious to visit her. He spoke to
the business agent of his union and also spoke to the head of his employer’s
organization. He was told that no definite guarantee could be given at that
time, but to communicate with his employer on his return from abroad. Claimant
thereupon left and returned from abroad in October. He promptly communicated
with his employer but there was no work then available for him. He thereafter
filed the claim in issue. When claimant was questioned at the insurance office
he was told about the disqualification which was intended to be issued and
objected orally thereto. He did not return to the insurance office after the
issuance of the initial determination in reliance upon what he believed had
been instructions to him not to return to that office until November 29. Had it
not been for what he believed were instructions to this effect he would have
continued to report and would earlier have requested a hearing.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Although
claimant did not formally request a hearing within 20 days from the issuance of
the determination no November 5 he did object orally on the very date that the
determination was issued when he was interviewed at the insurance office with
respect to the circumstances surrounding the termination of his employment. I
am convinced that although it was not intended by the insurance office
representative that claimant conclude that he was to discontinue reporting
until November 29, claimant relied upon what he considered to be instructions
to this effect. I hold that claimant’s oral protest was sufficient to
constitute a request for a hearing and that he is entitled to a hearing on the
merits. In the instant case claimant did not leave his job over any objection
voiced by his employer. He followed what had been standard practice to extend
leaves of absence to employees of long standing if there was a meritorious
reason therefore. Claimant left under a mutual understanding that there would
be further work for him on his return. The failure of his employer to furnish
claimant with additional work when he reapplied following his return from
abroad was because of a falling off in business which was not anticipated at
the time claimant left. I hold under these circumstances that claimant’s
leaving was not without good cause under circumstances, which should subject
him to disqualification. The initial determination that claimant voluntarily
left employment without good cause is overruled.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: After a
review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and
due deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee’s
findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no
errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact
made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board, except as follows:
We find that claimant voluntarily left his employment to make a trip to Germany
to accompany his wife, as a matter of personal convenience and not because of
any compelling necessity. He and his wife went to Europe to see his wife’s
mother, not claimant’s mother, as was found by the referee. Claimant was aware
that his employer did not grant him a leave of absence for the purpose of his
visit to Germany and that he was to assume the risk of being re-employed upon
his return. The question presented is whether or not claimant voluntarily left
his employment with good cause. After an examination of the record and
testimony adduced before the referee, we can not agree with the conclusion
reached by the referee, which is at variance with his findings of fact, that
claimant left his employment under a mutual understanding that there would be
further work for him on his return from abroad. On the contrary, claimant was
made aware that his request for a leave of absence for a period of six months
would not be granted. He was given to understand that if work were available
for him upon his return from abroad, he might be rehired, but there was no
assurance that a job would be available. When claimant returned from his trip
and applied for reinstatement, his employer found no need for his services and
did not rehire him. Under the circumstances, claimant is deemed to have left
his employment without good cause within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. The initial determination of the local office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days effective October 18,
1954 on the ground that he voluntarily left his employment without good cause
is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (April 1, 1955)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the
Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant filed for benefits
effective January 31, 1955. By initial determination effective that date, she
was disqualified for 42 days after the certification of her return to the labor
market because of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause and
withdrawal from the labor market. Her future benefits were reduced by 20
effective days because of a wilful misrepresentation to obtain benefits.
Claimant was employed by a marine insurance firm for about six years up to
August 15, 1954, at a terminal salary of $70 to $75 weekly, as a clerk-typist.
In April, she gave notice of her intention to resign effective the middle of
August because of the volume of work which required that she take some home
with her on approximately ten weekends during the busy season of the year. She
was not compensated for this and although she would have remained if she had
been offered more money, she preferred that additional help be hired in order
to perform the extra work. During her reporting period, claimant was ready and
willing to work but only in the City Island section of the Bronx where she
resides. There is practically no opportunity for her to get employment in that
area at least until May 1. On two occasions at the insurance office, claimant
certified in writing that she had executed written applications at employment
agencies when she had not; at the time she made these certifications she
intended to apply to the agencies and subsequently did.</span></p>

did not have good cause to quit her job under the Unemployment Insurance Law.
She disclaimed any contention that the work was injurious to her health and

she did. She was out of the labor market in view of her restriction to work in
the City Island section of the Bronx where there was no opportunity of her
employment, on her testimony, until the beginning of May. The false certifications
referred to constituted wilful misrepresentations to obtain benefits under
Section 594 of the Law. The initial determinations are sustained. (March 21,

was held at which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant filed a claim effective October 4, 1954. By
initial determination she was disqualified for refusal of employment without
good cause effective November 12 and effective November 30. By alternative
initial determination she was ruled ineligible because of unavailability for
employment effective November 12. She was declared overpaid $50.75 for the
weeks ending November 14 and November 21. Claimant, a single woman, 21 years of
age, was employed from October 1952, until August 13, 1954, by a chain bakery
store as a shop manager at $51.75 for a five and a half day week. Her hours of
employment were 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or at claimant’s
convenience. During the period of her employment claimant was attending night
classes at a local college. The classes began at 5:45 p.m. During the period in
issue, she was also attending the same school two nights a week beginning 5:45
p.m. On November 12 claimant was called to the employment office and an
interviewer discussed with claimant the possibility of her accepting employment
with a department store. There were many job orders at the time for temporary
salespersons, but they all required employment until 6 p.m. with an additional
night until 9 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. Claimant was not interested in any of those
jobs because of the hours, which would conflict with her school attendance. She
indicated that she would take a job until 5:30 p.m. She was not offered any job
until November 30 when she was offered employment with a specific department
store as a temporary salesperson to work from 9:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. at $40 a
week. Claimant refused the job because the hours would interfere with her
school. On claimant’s last job she was required to spend most of her time
keeping the records of the store, ordering merchandise and supervising the work
of eight persons. She is able to type and has done filing. She has sought
employment by applying to six employment agencies, which referred her to at
least 20 employers for work in the clerical capacity. She does not restrict her
employment in any manner except as to not being willing to work subsequent to
5:30 p.m. Claimant was placed by a fee charging agency in a temporary job and
worked from December 8,1954, through January 15 as a typist-clerk at $40 a
week. Most white collar workers are not employed after 5:30 p.m.</span></p>

no definite job offer made to claimant on November 12. Therefore, there was no
refusal effective that date. The job offered to claimant on November 30 she
refused because of the hours which would interfere with her schooling. There
were other opportunities for claimant within the hours she was willing to work
and which she had previously worked. She therefore had good cause for refusing
the job. Claimant’s restriction to employment to no later than 5:30 p.m. was
not sufficient to render claimant unavailable for employment. She has sought
employment diligently by applying to many employers to which she had been
referred by fee charging agencies. The jobs to which she was referred were all
within the hours that she was willing to work. There was not other
disqualifying information submitted and claimant obtained employment because of
her own efforts. She therefore was available within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law during the period she claimed benefits. The initial
determinations are overruled. Claimant was not overpaid.</span></p>

and chronic complaints. After claimant’s discharge, reinstatement of claimant
and the other person involved in the altercation was asked by the union. The
other person was reinstated because of a superior work record. Claimant was not
reinstated. It appeared that claimant referred derogatorily by vile
name-calling to her fellow-employee, whereupon the other woman struck her. The
altercation then ensured. Claimant contended that she was so exasperated and
unnerved by the refusal of her co-worker to stop the machine at which they were
working when it appeared that some of the work must be spoiled, that she lost
control of herself and indulged in the name calling. When claimant was
registered in the employment office, she informed it that she did not desire to
have factory employment any longer. Claimant had had past experience as a
salesperson. She considered herself competent to do such work and she asked
that she be offered employment as a salesperson. Therefore, on November 14 the
employment office offered claimant a temporary job for the Christmas holidays
as saleswoman in one of the department stores. Concededly, the usual pay rate
is 90¢ hourly for such work. In the department store to which claimant was
being referred, the union of jurisdiction permitted the employer to hire
temporary employees at $33 weekly. It appears that there were about four
department stores in the metropolitan area which received the same sanction
either from a store-controlled union or independent unions. Claimant refused
the job for insufficient pay.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Since
claimant was guilty of provocation which led to the altercation in the
employer’s establishment while all were at work, I must hold that her discharge
was due to misconduct in the course of employment. Fighting during work on the
employer’s premises is recognized as being misconduct in the course of
employment. Claimant’s benefits were correctly suspended therefore beginning
October 17 the day after she was last employed. However, claimant is not to be
disqualified for refusal of employment. She was then in a period of suspension
when no benefits of any kind could accrue to her. Section 592.2 requires that</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The suspension of claimant’s
benefits during the period gave her with rights or obligations under the
Unemployment Insurance Law. Since she was not a benefit claimant on November 14
she cannot be disqualified for refusing employment. Moreover, claimant may not
be disqualified for refusing to accept a job at a pay rate which was concededly
below the prevailing hiring rate for her occupation, regardless of any sanction
given by any union, independent or otherwise. The initial determination of
misconduct is sustained. The initial determination of refusal of employment is
overruled.</span></p>

careful review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee
and due deliberation having been had thereon and having found that the
referee’s findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this case and
that no errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings
of fact made by the referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of this
Board, except as follows: Claimant was employed at factory work for the past
eight years. She has restricted her present availability for employment to work
as a salesperson which she has not done for many years prior thereto. We are
not in accord with the conclusion reached by the referee with respect to the
initial determination in issue on this appeal. For the past eight years,
claimant has been employed as a general helper in a factory. She has limited
her employability to sales work which she concededly has not performed for many
years prior thereto. Under the circumstances, we believe the claimant was
offered suitable employment and one for which she is reasonably fitted by
training and experience. The rate of pay was not substantially less favorable
than the work prevailing for similar work in the locality for sales personnel
with claimant’s background and experience. We therefore hold that claimant
refused the offer of employment without good cause and that she should be
disqualified for such refusal. The initial determination of the local office
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits, effective November 14, 1951, on
the ground that, without good cause, she refused an offer of employment for
which she is reasonably fitted by training and experience is sustained. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (June 20, 1952)</span></p>

re-filed a claim effective December 27, 1954. By initial determination, it was
ruled that he made a wilful misrepresentation and his rights to future benefits
were reduced by 20 effective days. The determination was sustained in Case
534-48-55R, at which time claimant failed to appear. Leave was given to
claimant to apply to reopen the case upon giving satisfactory explanation for
his default. Claimant did not appear at the hearing because of a death in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant is 48 years of age. He was
last employed prior to filing his claim by a cemetery as a laborer for
approximately six months until December 15 when he was let go because of
absences attributable to illness. When claimant filed his claim he stated that
he was last employed by the C. Construction Corporation and that he last worked
on June 23, 1954, and became unemployed because of lack of work. He also
indicated that he had not filed a claim because he had been out of town.
Claimant did not intend to deceive or withhold information from the insurance
office because he knew that his last employer was a non-covered employer and he
did not believe that it was interested in that type of employment. Claimant was
motivated by the fact that he is a member of a construction workers’ union and
did not want it to learn that he had been employed in work which was not of a
union nature because his membership in the union would be revoked and he would
lose future employment opportunities.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The issue
in this case is whether claimant wilfully made a false representation for the
purpose of obtaining benefits. The referee overruled the initial determination
of the local office on the ground that claimant’s motive in making the false
representation was not to obtain benefits, but to prevent his union from
learning that he had been employed by a non-union employer, which would
jeopardize his union membership. The referee cited&nbsp;<u>Matter of Avis</u>,
283 App. Div. 908, affirming Appeal Board, 38,790-53, in support of his ruling.
We are not in accord with the conclusions of the referee. The claimant
admittedly made several false statements to the local office representative
when he filed his claim for benefits. He stated the name of his last employer
as C. Construction Corporation; that he had last been employed on June 23,
1954; that his loss of employment was due to lack of work and that he had not
filed his claim before December because he had been out of town from August
until December 1954. All of these statements were concededly false. Claimant’s
last employer was C. Cemetery; his last loss of employment was due to his
discharge because of repeated absences due to illness; that last date of his
employment was December 15, 1954, and between August and December 1954,
claimant was in town and was employed by the C. Cemetery. We have repeatedly held
that:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In order
for the local office to determine whether a person is under suspension or
disqualification in accordance with Section 527, subdivision (b) thereof, it is
essential that the claimant disclose the name of his last employer. Failure on
the part of claimant to disclose the name of his employer would make it
virtually impossible for the local office to investigate and determine whether
a claimant is disqualified or suspended from receiving benefits. Therefore,
claimant’s failure to disclose his last employer must be considered a wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits and a forfeit penalty of 20 effective days
is to be imposed upon claimant accordingly. (Appeal board, 31,643-52; Appeal
Board, 33,371-52.)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The fact that claimant was not
disqualified by the local office because he left his employment with C.
Cemetery, after claimant disclosed the identity of such employer and an
investigation was made by the local office, does not in any way change the
nature of the offense charged. Until a ruling had been made by the local office
after an investigation of all the facts, claimant had no way of knowing whether
his leaving of employment with C. Cemetery would lead to a disqualification by
the local office. By concealing the identity of such last employer, claimant
precluded the local office from making such investigation and a determination
on the basis thereof. If a claimant certifies to a false fact, knowing that it
is false, the statute authorizes the forfeiture, regardless of claimant’s
interpretation of the ultimate effect of his false statement (See&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Bernstein</u>, 278 App. Div. 625, affirmed, 303 N.Y. 755, reversing Appeal
Board, 22,265-50). In our opinion, the decision of the Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Davis</u>, above, to which reference is made in the referee’s decision, is
not applicable to the facts in this case. In that case the misrepresentation
was made by claimant for the purpose of disqualifying herself from receiving
benefits. We believe that the decision in that case should be limited solely to
the facts thereof. We hold that claimant did make a false representation for
the purpose of obtaining benefits and that the forfeiture imposed was proper.
It is not necessary to prove a criminal intent to support a charge of a wilful
misrepresentation under Section 594 of the Law. (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Bernstein</u>, above.) The determination of the local office holding that
claimant wilfully made a false representation for the purpose of obtaining
benefits, as a result of which a forfeit penalty of 20 effective days was
imposed against his future benefit rights, is sustained. The decision of the
referee is reversed. (May 6,1955)</span></p>

Office determination on the basis of the decision of the Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter

decision is not applicable to the facts in this case since, in the&nbsp;<u>Davis</u>&nbsp;case,
the misrepresentation was made by claimant for the purpose of disqualifying
herself from receiving benefits and that the Court’s decision should be limited
solely to the facts thereof. For the purpose of comparison, the following is
the decision of the Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Davis</u>.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;Claimant usually worked
Saturdays and Sundays only. She reported to the local unemployment insurance
office on May 18, 1953, and reported that she had worked on Sunday, May
17,1953, and had earned $10 on that day, but had called her employer’s place of
business on that morning and stated that she was sick. Claimant states that she
had no ulterior motive in making this false statement because by so doing she
was disqualifying herself for benefits for that day. She was afraid that if she
stated that she was sick and did not work it would involve obtaining a doctor’s
certificate and other complications.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Law (Labor Law, §594), provides: ‘A claimant who has wilfully made a false
statement or representation to obtain any benefit under the provisions of this
article shall forfeit * * *.’ The forfeiture imposed by the Industrial
Commissioner in this case was for 24 effective days. Something more is required
by the statute than a wilful false statement. It must be made ‘to obtain
benefits.’ Certainly the false statement here was not made to obtain any cash
benefit, and we do not think the record discloses that it was made to obtain
any benefit. It was really made to disqualify her from benefits for the day
involved. We do not think that the false statement was made for the purpose,
which the statute requires, or comes within the spirit or intent of the statute
necessary to work forfeiture. We do not hold that the false statement must be
made to obtain a cash benefit, and we certainly do not condone making any false
statement at all, but upon this particular record we do not think that a
forfeiture was authorized.&quot;</span></p>

messenger, filed for benefits effective January 17, 1955. An initial
determination was issued disqualifying him for 42 days commencing with that
date because of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause, and in the
alternative, suspending his benefits for seven weeks commencing with January 15
because of loss of employment due to misconduct in connection therewith. The
employer is a communications organization. Claimant, who is 61 years old,
worked for it from September 1953, until January 14, 1955. During the first
three or four months of his employment he worked full time, thereafter part
time for reasons of health. He was stationed at a branch office on 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Street
in Manhattan, and was paid 90-2/3 cents an hour. Claimant was a member of a
union local with which the employer was in contractual relations. Claimant’s
services were terminated by the employer after he refused to fill out a
personnel security questionnaire which the Federal Department of Defense
required the employer to have filled out and certified as correct by its
employees. The testimony of the employer's witness and that of claimant was not
in agreement as to when the questionnaire was first given to claimant for that
purpose, the former stating he believed it was in August, and claimant
declaring it was shortly before Christmas. However, claimant's attorney
conceded that claimant was given a reasonable opportunity to furnish the
information requested. The questionnaire, in part, called for information which
usually would be considered of a personal nature, relating not only to claimant
but also to his close relatives. Claimant refrained from filling it out. He did
so for reasons which he contended were his private concern, without indicating
which specific items he regarded as objectionable. His union initially voiced
objection to having its members fill out the questionnaire, but subsequently
acquiesced in the procedure and advised them to comply. Claimant, however, did
not do so. When claimant finished his work day on January 14 he was told that
under the circumstances he should not return, but nevertheless he reported for
work the following Monday. He was not permitted to continue on the job. In
furnishing the insurance office with information relating to claimant's
separation from his employment, the employer stated that claimant last worked
for it on January 14 and left of his own accord, explaining that he had refused
to fill out the security questionnaire.</span></p>

of law to have left his employment voluntarily and without good cause. We think
that this situation would show a failure to meet a reasonable condition of the
work. Since it would be an act inevitably terminating the employment, it would
become also a voluntary withdrawal.</span></p>

filed for Federal employee benefits effective January 31, 1955. By initial
determination he was disqualified for 42 days effective January 31 for
voluntary leaving of his employment without good cause. For about eight years
claimant worked for the post office as a substitute postal clerk, Grade III.
His hourly rate of pay was $1.81½ and with overtime, claimant earned about
$5,000 a year. In order to retain the job, claimant was required to take three
examinations a year. For five years, claimant was able to study for these
examinations and pass them. During the last year of his employment, however, he
had serious domestic difficulties and as a consequence, he was unable to
prepare for the examinations and therefore did not take them. Claimant was
advised by the district superintendent that he faced dismissal because of his
failure to take these examinations.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span

overruled the initial determination on the theory that claimant was forced to
resign and was not acting voluntarily; that his inability to prepare for the
examinations was not a voluntary act. We do not agree with the referee. Where a
claimant can continue working but does not to so and leaves his employment
without other prospects of employment he is subject to disqualification unless
he has good cause for leaving his employment. The impending dismissal which was
facing claimant did not justify his resigning at a time when he could have
continued working. Furthermore, even if his leaving were in fact involuntary,
the termination of his employment because of his failure to take the
examinations was in and of itself tantamount to a voluntary leaving of
employment since he knew that taking such examination and passing same were
conditions imposed for continuing in the said employment. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Malaspina</u>, 285 App. Div. 564, reversing Appeal Board, 42,606-54, it was
stated as follows:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>* * * One
must foresee the clear sequential effects of one’s choice. This choice amounts
to an election by the employee not to meet a condition of work. The refusal to
pay a bus fare to get to work on time in the face of a foreseeable discharge;
or to get tools, clothing or equipment where they were required as the
employee’s part of the arrangement; or to secure needed technical preparation
to continue the work, where it was open to the employee to do any of these
things or not, would be treated as voluntary separations if they had the result
of ending the employment. * * *</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In the instant case it was
claimant’s responsibility to take the examinations. Having failed to do so he
is subject to the disqualification imposed by law. That claimant’s domestic
problems may have interfered with his taking the examinations does not under
the circumstances of this case provide good cause within the meaning of the
law. We are not persuaded that taking the examinations was &quot;a condition
beyond the reasonable reach of the employee&quot; (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Malaspina</u>, above). Under all of the facts and circumstances in this case we
conclude that the claimant did not have good cause for leaving his employment
and his consequent disqualification was, therefore, proper. The initial
determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 consecutive days effective January 31, 1955, on the ground that
he voluntarily left his employment without good cause, is sustained. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (June 10, 1955)</span></p>

agree with the conclusion of the referee that claimant had good cause to leave

was committed to give claimant an increase and failed to do so. An analysis of
the evidence leads us to a different conclusion. We have repeatedly held that
although a desire for a raise in salary is understandable, leaving one’s
employment when a raise is not given does not, by itself, constitute good cause
for leaving within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. This is
particularly true when we take into consideration the fact that claimant had no
immediate prospect of employment when she left her position; that she had had
her salary increased from $50 to $70 per week in the first two years of her
employment; that the employer advised her that business conditions did not
warrant an increase at that time, that claimant had reached the employer’s
maximum for the position and that the remuneration received by claimant was not
substantially less favorable to her than that prevailing for similar services
in her locality. Under the circumstances herein, claimant was properly
disqualified for having voluntarily left her employment without good cause. The
initial determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimant
resides in Mayfield, New York and worked for a contractor for one and a half
years as an oiler on the New York State Thruway. Prior thereto he worked as a
glove cutter for 15 years. He was laid off for lack of work on November 4,
1954. He filed an original claim for benefits effective November 8, 1954 and
registered for employment. Claimant was elected Justice of the Peace for the
Town of Mayfield in November 1951 for a four-year term commencing January 1952.
The town elects two justices. Claimant is a member of the Town Board, which
meets at 8 p.m. on the first Monday of each month. Other than to attend
meetings and assist with the budget, he has no duties as a member of the Town
Board. He receives an annual salary of $850 which is paid to him on a monthly
basis. In addition, the justices have civil and criminal jurisdiction. The
justices fix the hours during which they perform duties, most of which are
performed during the evenings. When one justice is not available, the other can
be called upon to serve. While employed, claimant’s duties as a justice of the
peace never interfered with his full-time employment. Only on one occasion was
claimant contacted at his place of employment in connection with his duties as
a justice. During his tenure as a justice, claimant has never conducted either
a civil or a criminal trial, with or without a jury. His work as a justice
consists largely of pleas and dispositions in connection with traffic
violations. In the entire year of 1954, claimant had 33 cases involving such
violations and he estimated that the entire time consumed in that year in
disposing of them approximated 40 hours. Court cases were conducted in
claimant’s home and he bore all necessary expenses in connection therewith. The
local office issued an initial determination holding claimant ineligible to
receive benefits effective November 8, 1954 on the ground that he was not
totally unemployed. The basis of such determination was that claimant was
holding a salaried public office as a justice of the peace and as such was
continuously employed. Claimant protested and requested a hearing. The referee
sustained the initial determination from which decision claimant appealed to
the Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee’s ruling that claimant was not totally unemployed because throughout
the period in issue his duties as a justice of the peace required him to hold
himself available for call whenever the occasion should arise, was based on the
authority of prior decisions of the Board. In a recent decision involving a
justice of the peace of the Town of Hague who received an annual salary of
$400, we distinguished and ruled inapplicable the cases relied on by the
referee. The following portion of our opinion in Appeal Board, 47,338-54 is
equally applicable to the facts in the instant case:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Appeal
Board decisions, involving the councilman, the ward supervisor, the town clerk
and the truant officer, relied on by the referee, are distinguishable from the
instant case. There was evidence in those cases that the claimants were
performing services of a continuous nature, in that they were called upon to
perform their official duties from day to day. Such does not appear to be the
situation here, and consequently those decisions are not determinative of the
issue in the instant case. Reference to Section 45 of the Justice Court Act and
Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cited by the claimant, shows
that in the case of any civil action commenced by a summons before a justice of
the peace, the date and time of the hearing is fixed at a time agreeable to the
justice of the peace and that in the case of any criminal proceeding provision
is made, in the event the justice is absent or unable to act, for the transfer
of the case to the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the town or in the
same county. The record now before us shows that whatever official duties were
performed by claimant took place at the times fixed by claimant and that never
during the 15 years of his employment has there been any interference with his
work or his availability for other employment. We conclude, therefore, that
only on those days when claimant attended meetings of the Town Board or
attended to actual trial of cases was he not totally unemployed. Since the
record does not disclose the number of meetings attended by claimant or the
actual trials conducted by him during the period in question, this case is
returned to the local office for further inquiry and a new determination in
accordance with this decision.</span></p>

case is returned to the local office for a new determination in accordance with

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant and representatives of her union, of the employer,
and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testimony was taken. Claimant,
a finisher, filed effective November 8, 1954. By initial determinations she was
ruled ineligible for benefits in the week ending November 14 on the ground that
she was not totally unemployed, and she was charged with an overpayment of $30
and with having wilfully made a false statement on November 23 thereby reducing
her rights to future benefits by 24 effective days to be forfeited. Claimant
worked on three days in the week ending November 14. Her earnings, as a result
thereof, were in excess of $30. Notwithstanding that fact, on November 23
claimant certified that she had worked on only two days of the week in issue
and that she was unemployed on each of the other days in that week and that her
earnings were only $26. On the basis of such certification claimant was credited
with two effective days, but since that was the week in which she had filed an
original claim, she received no cash benefits but the two effective days with
which she was credited were applied toward her waiting period. Subsequently,
after she had accumulated two additional effective days in weeks to which she
subsequently certified, she then commenced to receive benefit payments at the
rate of $30 weekly. Claimant does not dispute the correctness of the initial
determination ruling her ineligible due to lack of total unemployment, but she
disputes the correctness of the initial determinations establishing the
overpayment and charging her with a wilful misrepresentation. She contends that
she carelessly certified incorrectly for the week in issue.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee’s Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: In view
of claimant’s concession with respect to the correctness of the ruling that she
lacked total unemployment in the week ending November 14 such initial
determination remains in effect. In view of claimant’s lack of total
unemployment in that week, claimant was not entitled to the credit of two
effective days which was granted on the basis of her certification, and hence
she was overpaid all benefits subsequently paid to her on the premise that she
had actually accumulated two effective days in the week ending November 14.
Claimant has shown no valid reason for having certified to earnings in a lesser
amount than her actual earnings and to unemployment on five days of the week,
rather than only four days of the week. Her claim that the erroneous
certification came about as a result of her carelessness cannot be accepted
since it is presumed that she knew when she certified that she had actually
worked on three days in the week in issue and that her earnings were in excess of
$30. She therefore wilfully made a false statement to receive benefits as
contemplated by the provisions of Section 594 of the Unemployment Insurance
Law. In view of the fact that the week in issue was not a compensable week, and
that claimant was credited only with effective days toward a waiting period,
the correct penalty to be applied as a result of such wilful misrepresentation
is 20 effective days to be forfeited rather than 24 effective days to be
forfeited. The Appeal Board has so ruled in Appeal Board, 48,695-55 in a case
involving identical facts, and the referee is bound by such decision. The
initial determination ruling claimant ineligible for the week ending November
14 due to lack of total unemployment, is sustained. The initial determinations
charging claimant with an overpayment and with having wilfully made a false
statement to receive benefits are modified to the extent that it is held that
claimant was overpaid all benefits received by her as a result of having been
credited with two effective days in the week ending November 14 and the penalty
for the wilful misrepresentation is reduced to 20 effective days to be
forfeited and, as so modified, the initial determination is sustained.</span></p>

not receive any cash benefits for the week ending November 14, 1954, which was
the waiting week, as a result of her misrepresentation on November 23, 1954.
Accordingly, the referee properly ruled that the number of effective days
forfeited should be reduced to 20 days. (See Appeal Board, 48,695-55.) The

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant and representatives of his union, the employer, and
of the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a
deckhand, filed a claim effective March 21, 1955, thereby establishing a base
period from March 22, 1954 to March 20, 1955, thereby establishing a base
period from March 22, 1954 to March 20, 1955. An initial determination was
issued ruling him ineligible because he did not file a valid original claim, in
that he did not have 20 weeks of employment in his base period. He was credited
with 19 weeks of employment and earnings of $2269.08, with six employers. In
regard to the employer herein he was credited with 11 weeks of employment and
earnings of $1880.50. He claimed 16 weeks of employment with this employer.
Claimant was employed on the &quot;Samuel J. Dark&quot; from November 26, 1954
to March 13, 1955. The pattern of his employment was to work for two weeks, 144
hours bi-weekly, 12 hours a day, instead of eight hours a day and to be off one
week. The employer, by letter dated January 19, 1955, sent to the Division of
Employment in regard to another claimant, Case 550-36-55R, in opposing payment
of benefits to that claimant for the &quot;off week,&quot; stated:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;We
are enclosing your form L.O. 550 dated January 17, 1955, which he have
executed. We think that the employee, Mr. W.S., is under a misapprehension in
having filed an application for unemployment compensation benefits. The facts
are these: Mr. S. is a deckhand on our tug &quot;SAMUEL J. DARK&quot;. He is
employed under a Collective Bargaining agreement, which fixes his daily rate of
pay at $14.12. The daily rate of pay is compensation for an eight hour work
day. In order to have more time ashore, for their own convenience, the crew
members of the tug, by arrangement with the tug master, spend one third of the
days during which the tug is in operation ashore, and this is accomplished by
those of their fellow crew members who are aboard the tug working, in addition
to their own eight-hour shifts, four hours for the benefit of the men ashore.
As a matter of our bookkeeping convenience merely, we pay the men only for the
days that they are actually aboard the tug, and on those days we pay them not
eight, but twelve hours, or a day and a half's pay. The period during which Mr.
S. is claiming to have been unemployed represents the time that he was ashore
under the arrangement before-mentioned, and for which he has been paid by the
method just outlined. We, therefore, believe that there is no basis for the
claim.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In the above-cited case an initial
determination had been issued ruling that claimant was not totally unemployed
during the week that he was off. The case of S. was closed upon notification to
the Referee Section that he could not appear because he was then employed. A
similar initial determination was issued in the case of E.V.W., Case
12-117-53R. The claimant in that case withdrew his request for a hearing. The
Industrial Commissioner's representative relies on Appeal Board, 43,058-54,
affirming Case 3-115-53R, wherein the referee ruled that a seaman, whose work
period during the month was two-thirds of the month and who was off one-third
of the month, was totally unemployed during the third of the month he was off.
The referee in that case made a finding of fact that during the ten days such
claimant was off the boat, he performed no service for the employer and that he
was ready, willing and able to accept other employment. Claimant herein, could
not accept employment during the week off on any other vessel subject to the
union contract. Claimant had earnings in covered employment with the employer
herein as follows:</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Section
524 of the Unemployment Insurance Law states as one of the definitions of a
week of employment that it is a week in which a claimant does some work in
employment for an employer liable for contributions. The Industrial
Commissioner’s regulation 2(2)(g) amplifies the definition by providing that a
week of employment includes any statutory week during any part of which an
employee is on paid vacation or other paid leave of absence even if no actual
work is performed. By this Regulation the definition of a week of employment
has been extended to vacation weeks during which no work is done for the
employer. Any other conclusion in regard to vacation weeks would be repugnant
to the intent of the law. The contract of hire existing between the employer and
claimant was a continuing one for consecutive three week periods. By contract
the parties have accomplished the same result which was accomplished by the
above Regulation. Regardless of the days on which services were actually
performed, the respective three week units constituted weeks of employment. The
issues in the cases cited above are in regard to whether the respective
claimants were or were not totally unemployed. The issue in this case is in
regard to whether the &quot;off weeks&quot; were weeks of employment as defined
in the statute. The union and employers in the Harbor of New York who operate
in the same manner regard such employees as having been employed during the off
weeks. They do not contemplate that such employees shall be eligible for
benefits during the off weeks. Consideration must be given to an industry
practice which is widespread. Further, the facts in this case are substantially
different from the facts found in the case upon which the Appeal Board decision
is based. It was found therein that claimant was ready, able and willing to
accept employment. Claimant herein could not obtain any employment aboard a
vessel during his off weeks similar to the employment which he had. Based upon
these several reasons, it is found that claimant had 16 weeks of employment
including the weeks when he was not on the vessel. He should be credited with
the filing of a valid original claim since he had at least 20 weeks of
employment in his base period. He is eligible for benefits, subject to the
other provisions of the Law. The employer is liable for contributions
accordingly.</span></p>

employment. Based on an interview with claimant and an investigation conducted
by the local office, the local office issued initial determinations
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days
effective May 24, 1955 on the ground that she voluntarily left her employment
without good cause and holding that she wilfully made a false statement for the
purpose of obtaining benefits for which a forfeiture of 20 effective days was
imposed. Claimant protested the determinations and requested a hearing. The
referee sustained the determination as to voluntary leaving and overruled the
determination as to misrepresentation. The Industrial Commissioner has appealed
to the Board from such decision insofar as adverse to him.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee overruled the initial determination of wilful misrepresentation on the
premise that the person who filled out the form for claimant, in entering the
words &quot;no work&quot; thereon, disregarded claimant’s instructions since he
found that claimant had informed that person that she had quit the job because of
the inadequate lighting in the shop. We do not agree with the referee’s
conclusion because it is contrary to the weight of the credible evidence in the
record. There appears to be no reason why the person who volunteered to assist
claimant would deliberately violate claimant’s instructions as to the
information to be recorded on the form. A person is ordinarily chargeable with
the acts of another whom he appoints to act in his place and there appears to
be no good reason for making an exception thereto under the facts herein. Even
if it be true that claimant does not read English very well and that the
information on the form was incorrectly recorded contrary to her instructions,
it does not appear that claimant made any effort to verify the accuracy of the
information as recorded by having one of the local office personnel read back
to her the information contained thereon after the form was completed. This
casts serious doubt on her good faith in the matter. An analysis of the
testimony in the record discloses that claimant’s answers to questions were
responsive, and a careful examination of her handwritten signature discloses
that her ignorance of the English language is not perhaps as extensive as she
claims. The determination of wilful misrepresentation was correctly issued by
the local office. The initial determinations of the local office disqualifying
claimant, M.R. from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days effective May
24, 1955 for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause and holding
that she wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits
for which a forfeiture of 20 effective days was imposed as a penalty are
sustained. The decision of the referee is modified in accordance with the
foregoing and, as so modified, is affirmed. (September 2, 1955)</span></p>

Louisiana Unemployment Insurance Law. The claimant, a seaman, was employed from
February 17 through May 8, 1955 aboard one of the employer’s vessels, which he
left upon the completion of its voyage. Claimant filed an original interstate
claim for benefits in Louisiana as the agent State against New York as the
liable State effective May 16, 1955 and registered for employment. Predicated
on his New York earnings in covered employment during his base period and
information received from the employer herein, as claimant’s last employer, the
Out-of-State Resident Office issued an initial determination holding claimant
eligible to receive benefits effective May 16, 1955, without disqualifying
conditions. The employer disputed the payment of benefits to claimant, objected
to the aforementioned initial determination of the Out-of-State Resident
Office, requested a hearing before a referee purportedly pursuant to Section
520.1(a) of the Unemployment Insurance Law and made the statutory deposit of
$10. The referee sustained the initial determination of the Out-of-State
Resident Office, overruled the employer’s objection and ruled that the employer
was not entitled to the return of its statutory deposit. Thereupon, the
employer appealed to the Board purportedly pursuant to Section 621.1 of the Law
and made the statutory deposit of $25.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A hearing
was held at which claimant appeared and testified. A statement submitted on
behalf of the Industrial Commissioner was considered. Claimant, classified as a
clerk I, filed a valid original claim for benefits effective August 1, 1955. He
was deemed to have refiled constructively effective October 10 at which time an
initial determination was issued ruling him ineligible from October 7 to
October 9 inclusive, for failure to comply with reporting requirements.
Claimant tried to file for benefits on July 8. At that time, his claim was
accepted as a matter of form in the first instance and he was instructed to
report to the employment office the same day, which he did. The date to report
to the employment office was entered in the appropriate column in claimant’s
insurance book insert. At the employment office, claimant was given a next day
to report there of October 7 and that date also was entered in the same column
of his insurance book insert. On July 18 however, claimant’s claim was
invalidated, with the result that his next filing of August 1 became his
original valid claim. Claimant did not report to the employment office on
October 7, a Friday. Previously, on Monday of that week, he reported, as
required, to the insurance office. The reason for his failure to go to the
employment office on October 7 was that the insurance office did not instruct
him to go there when or after he filed his valid original claim on August 1 and
in the absence of such instruction, the October 7 entry in his insurance book
insert was meaningless to him.</span></p>

is within the purview of the decision of the Appeal Board in its case
49,872-55. The Board there stated, in substance, that when a claim for benefits
lapses, there falls with it the obligation of the claimant to comply with
previous instructions to report to the employment office, although such
reporting date occurs within a subsequent period when claimant is again deemed
to be in benefits. The Board declared that under such circumstances</span></p>

at the placement office in accordance with Regulation 42 of the Industrial
Commissioner’s regulations. The requirement to report, based upon a prior claim

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

given October 7 as a date to report to the employment office when he was there

a reporting date to the employment office at any time commencing with August 1;
nor was the reporting date of October 7 reassigned to him during the existence
of his valid claim. Under the circumstances, claimant may not be deemed to have
failed to have complied with reporting requirements. The initial determination
is overruled. (November 29, 1955)</span></p>

was held at which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a sewing-machine operator, filed for benefits
effective June 27, 1955, and August 29, 1955. By an initial determination she
was declared ineligible from July 13 through July 17 for unavailability for
employment. She was disqualified effective August 29 for 42 days for
voluntarily leaving her employment without good cause and, finally, her future
benefit rights were reduced by 20 effective days for wilfully misrepresenting
to obtain benefits. Claimant marked her booklet with the letter &quot;Y&quot;
for July 14 and 15 and certified that she worked those days in her usual
occupation. Actually, claimant did not work those days but was occupied
painting her house. Claimant did not wish to claim benefits for those days as
she was not available for employment, and used the letter &quot;Y&quot; for
that purpose. Claimant now realizes that the letter &quot;O&quot; would have been
the more correct designation. The job painting claimant’s three-room apartment
took more than the two days, July 14 and 15. Actually, she was thus engaged
from July 13 through July 17. Claimant was disqualified effective August 29 for
voluntary leaving her employment without good cause because she insisted on
taking a vacation from August 6 to August 29. The employer told her that if she
did not work she would be terminated but claimant took her vacation
nevertheless.</span></p>

left her employment without good cause. She was told that if she took a
vacation she would lose her job. Claimant’s unemployment therefore was due to
her own fault. The initial determinations of unavailability and voluntary
leaving of employment are sustained. The initial determination that she
wilfully misrepresented to obtain benefits is overruled.</span></p>

careful review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the
referee, and due deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the
referee’s findings of fact and conclusions of law are fully supported by the
evidence in this case, and that no errors of fact or law appear to have been
made, the Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by
the referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of this Board,
except that we find that claimant was recalled by the employer to commence work
on July 13, 1955. She did not return to work on that day because she was busy
painting her apartment. We further find that claimant marked her reporting
booklet with the letter &quot;N&quot; for July 13 and subsequently certified at
the local office that she was ready, willing and able to work on July 13. The
Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and correctly
determined the issue involved in this case; except as stated above. In view of
our above findings we hold that claimant was properly charged with a wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits, inasmuch as she certified at the local
office that she was ready, willing and able to work on July 13. The local
office is entitled to such facts as will enable it to make a proper
determination of eligibility for benefits. It is significant that claimant did
not attempt to obtain benefits for July 14 and July 15, days on which she was
likewise engaged in painting her apartment. It is further noted that the
reporting booklet specifies that the letter &quot;O&quot; be used on those days
when a claimant is not willing to work. The initial determination of the local
office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective July 13
through July 16, 1955 on the ground of unavailability for employment,
disqualifying her from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days effective
August 29, 1955 for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause and
holding that she wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining
benefits resulting in a forfeit penalty of 20 effective days being imposed are
sustained. The decision of the referee is modified accordingly and, as so

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant, a Secretary II, filed for
benefits effective July 11, 1955. An initial determination was issued
disqualifying her as of July 28 for refusal of employment without good cause.
On July 28 the employment office referred claimant to two employers for work in
her classification, one of the employers being located on Seventh Avenue near
31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Street, Manhattan, the other on Ninth Avenue near 35<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Street,
Manhattan. Claimant went to the first-mentioned employer, who was willing to
pay her $75 a week to start. Claimant was told her working hours would be 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m., five days a week, with some Saturday work every fourth or fifth
week, and that she would be required to hand out work to several other girls in
the office. Claimant disliked the terms of the job, particularly the starting
hour, since in her past employment her workday had never begun prior to 9 a.m.
She also was averse to working on Saturdays and to what she assumed would be
exercising some degree of supervision over the other girls in the office.
Because she had the other referral to go to and hoped the conditions of that
job would be more favorable, she did not accept the employer’s offer of
employment. She then went to the other employer, where she was told there was
an opening at $75, and applied for the job. She was told the employer would let
the employment office know. The job had a 9 a.m. starting hour. The employer
subsequently informed the employment office that it had hired someone else. On
August 17 the employment office referred claimant to another position at $65 a
week. And claimant started to work for that employer on August 22.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We make the following additional
findings of fact: Claimant had been instructed by the employment service to
report for interview to the prospective employer located on Ninth Avenue before
reporting for interview to the prospective employer located on Seventh Avenue,
but she ignored such instruction and reported first to the Seventh Avenue
employer. Claimant also ignored an instruction given her by the employment
service to communicate with it by telephone after the conclusion of her
interview with the employer located on Ninth Avenue. The referee overruled the
initial determination of the local office, from which decision the Industrial
Commissioner appealed to the Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee overruled the initial determination of refusal of employment without
good cause on the theory that the employment service had given claimant the
choice of either of two jobs and that she was justified in refusing one of
them, which met the statutory standards, inasmuch as she was unaware at the
time that the second employer might be unwilling to hire her. We do not agree
with the result reached by the referee.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>That claimant was given two
referrals to employment at one time by the employment service is no indication
that it intended that claimant, without subjecting herself to a
disqualification by reason thereof, could refuse employment for which she was
reasonably fitted by training and experience and which in all other respects
met the statutory requirements, when it was offered to her by the employer here
involved. Nor does the statute provide that claimant may avoid a
disqualification from receiving benefits for her refusal of such employment on
the possibility that she might thereafter obtain other employment on more
advantageous terms. That claimant had no knowledge at the time in issue that
the prospective employer, not here involved, might be unwilling to hire her is
not pertinent. It is clear that the employment service gave claimant two
referrals to employment at one time merely to make is unnecessary for her to
seek a second referral in the event that one referral did not result in her
obtaining employment. The employment service did not, and could not under the
statute, give claimant the choice of refusing one of the jobs on the mere
chance that she might obtain the other. Inasmuch as claimant did not have the
choice of refusing either one of the employments, her refusal of the employment
in question subjected her to a disqualification from receiving benefits by
reason thereof. Claimant might have avoided such disqualification if she had
not ignored the various instructions given her by the employment service. Since
the employment refused by claimant was in her usual occupation and the salary,
hours and other conditions of employment were not substantially less favorable
to her than those prevailing for similar work in the locality, it must be
deemed that claimant refused employment without good cause within the meaning
of the Unemployment Insurance Law.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimant
worked from 1940 to May 13, 1955 as an agent for a life insurance company. His
duties consisted of servicing and selling life insurance policies and
collecting premiums from policy holders. It was an established company rule
that applicants for non-medical life insurance fill out the answers in the
application forms concerning the applicant’s past and present occupations,
illnesses and health conditions in the presence of the agent and that the agent
also witness the applicant’s signature to the application. The purpose of the
rule was to make it possible for the agent to detect risks not acceptable to
the company and also to make sure that the application was signed by the
insured in order to protect the company’s interests. Claimant had knowledge of
this company rule. On February 18, 1955, at 6 p.m., claimant called at the home
of a prospective applicant for a $1,000 life insurance policy, the premium to
be paid in monthly installments. The applicant was not home at that time. After
waiting about one hour, claimant left the applicant’s home. Claimant called at
the applicant’s home later in the evening but the latter still was not in. In
order to expedite matters, claimant then left the application form with the
applicant’s mother. He called at the applicant’s home the following morning and
received from the applicant’s mother the completed application form bearing the
applicant’s signature. Claimant falsely certified to the company that the
applicant signed this signature to the application in claimant’s presence. The
company accepted the application turned in by claimant and an insurance policy
was processed and issued to the applicant. The company later cancelled the
policy because it was not regarded as a bona fide contract in that the
application was not completed in the presence of the agent and the agent did
not witness the applicant’s signature. The only monetary loss sustained by the
company was the incidental cost in connection with the processing of the
policy. After an investigation, the employer discharged claimant effective May
13, 1955 because he violated company rules. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
effective May 16, 1955 and registered for employment. On May 18, 1955 the
employer notified the local office on the official form that claimant was
discharged for &quot;infraction of company rules.&quot; On May 26, 1955 claimant
admitted at the local office that he committed an infraction of the company
rule by submitting an application for insurance which was witnessed by the
applicant’s mother but asserted that the main reason for claimant’s discharge
was that his sales production was below par. On June 2, 1955 the local office
issued an initial determination holding claimant eligible to receive benefits
without disqualifying conditions and thereafter authorized the payment to him
of $90 in benefits, which he received. The employer, after making the $10
deposit, interposed objections to the determination on the ground that claimant
was discharged for misconduct. Based on additional information received from
the employer the local office on July 11, 1955 issued initial determinations
suspending the accumulation of claimant’s benefit rights for seven consecutive
weeks effective May 14, 1955 on the ground claimant lost his employment through
misconduct in connection with his employment and charging him with an
overpayment of $90 in benefits. The employer’s deposit was returned to it. The
theory of the misconduct determination was that claimant falsely certified to
the witnessing of a signature on an insurance application. Claimant contested
the initial determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determinations of misconduct and overpayment in benefits and the
Industrial Commissioner and the employer, after making the $25 statutory
deposit, appealed therefrom to the Board.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
referee overruled the initial determination effective May 14, 1955 on the
theory that although claimant did not follow prescribed procedures for taking
applications for insurance, he had seen the policy holder before and had
observed that he was free from physical impairment and there is no evidence
that claimant’s conduct resulted in any injury to the company. We are not in
accord with the referee’s conclusion. Claimant was discharged by the employer
because he violated an established company rule concerning the conduct of its
agents with respect to the issuance of non-medical life insurance policies. The
purpose of the rule was to safeguard the employer’s interests against bad
risks. The fact that there was no appreciable monetary loss to the employer in
the instant case does not aid claimant. In falsifying his certification as to
the genuineness of the applicant’s signature to the application, claimant had
acted in disregard of his obligation to the employer under the contract of
hire. We hold that under all the circumstances claimant’s acts were detrimental
to an in deliberate disregard of the employer’s interests and constituted
misconduct with the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Since claimant
failed to disclose to the local office pertinent facts which could have
affected the initial determination as to his filing of a valid original claim,
we hold that the benefits claimant received are recoverable. The initial
determination of the local office dated July 11, 1955 suspending the accumulation
of benefit rights by claimant for seven consecutive weeks effective May 14,
1955 on the ground that he lost his employment through misconduct in connection
with his employment and charging claimant with an overpayment of $90 in
benefits are sustained. The benefits paid to claimant are recoverable. The
appeal deposit of $25 is to be returned to the employer. The decision of the
referee is reversed. (12/9/55)</span></p>

initial determination effective June 20 he was disqualified for 42 days for
voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. The disqualification was
terminated by intervening employment on June 29. Claimant was employed by the
Military Sea Transportation Service from August 1953, until June 15, 1955. He
left the job because his request for a leave of absence was denied. He wanted
to remain at home for the period of one voyage because he had an appointment on
June 22 for the sale of a store which he owned, and which was being operated at
a loss by other members of his family. The contract for the sale of the
business was executed on June 22 and the bill of sale was executed on June 5.

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;Hearings
were held in Florida and New York at which claimant and a representative of the
Industrial Commissioner respectively appeared and testified. Claimant, a
timekeeper, filed effective October 21, 1952, at Miami, Florida. By initial
determination, effective December 1, she was ruled ineligible because of
unavailability for employment. By initial determination, her benefits were
ruled forfeited for 24 effective days because of wilful false statements made
to obtain benefits. For six winters, claimant's husband has worked in Florida.
Claimant left her New York position on October 26, to accompany him. Claimant's
husband had been negotiating for a distributorship in Florida, and thought he
had obtained one, but it did not materialize. He started work as a salesman in
January. On November 13, claimant wrote that the reason for her coming to
Florida was, &quot;to join my husband who obtained employment in Miami.&quot;
During the period in issue, until January 6, claimant sought work at about one
establishment a week, and also answered want-ads. However, beginning January 6,
claimant intensified her efforts, and eventually secured a position with her
husband's business.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Referee's Opinion and Decision</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: A
claimant who comes into a strange labor market area is expected to make
diligent efforts to seek employment. From December 1, through January 5,
claimant failed to make such efforts, but made mere token efforts. She was
unavailable during that time. However, effective January 6, claimant made more
diligent efforts, and eventually secured work. She became available on that
date. It is clear that claimant left New York because her husband was going to
be occupied in Florida. While he was not actually a party to an
employer-employee relationship on November 13, at the time claimant made the
allegedly false statement, he was actually engaged negotiating for business
opportunities. It does not clearly appear that claimant's statement on November
13 was a wilful misrepresentation. The initial determination of unavailability
is modified to be effective from December 1, through January 5, and as modified
is sustained. The initial determination of wilful misrepresentation is
overruled.</span></p>

January 5, 1953, and such decision having been filed in the Department of Labor
on May 28, 1953, (Appeal Board, 37,060-53) and the claimant having made

determined to hold a hearing for the purpose of considering such application,

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;Appeal
by claimant from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board which
disqualified claimant for benefits from December 1, 1952 through January 5,
1953 because of unavailability. In order to join her husband who expected to
obtain permanent employment in Florida where for several years he had spent the
winter months, claimant voluntarily left her employment as switchboard operator
in Rochester on October 21., 1952. Claimant's husband did not accept possible
employment in Jacksonville but continued on to Miami where he expected work
with a former employer. This did not materialize and he did not become employed
until about January 23, 1953 when he worked as a commission salesman. Claimant
solicited orders for him and he paid her from his drawing account.They returned
to Rochester at the end of March 1953 and claimant returned to her former
employment. Claimant contends that as soon as she arrived in Florida she sought
work, that she answered ads, visited employment agencies and went to practical
every hotel, but was unsuccessful. But in certifying her claim for benefits in
Florida, she listed only one personal contact for employment for the weeks
ending December 8th and 15th and two personal contacts for the weeks ending
December 22nd and 29th. Section 591 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, entitled
&quot;Eligibility for benefits&quot; provides, in part:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;2. Availability and
capability. No benefits shall be payable to any claimant Who is not capable of
work or who is not ready, willing and able to work in his usual employment or
in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training and
experience.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Whether a person is available for
employment during a specific period is a question of fact to be determined by
the Referee and the Appeal Board. Here there is a finding that claimant was
unavailable from December 1, 1952 through January 5, 1953. The evidence
sustains this finding. It seems to us that where, as here, a claimant leaves
the State of New York and goes to Florida for the winter months the Board may
require that convincing evidence of availability for employment be submitted in
order to sustain a claim for benefits. The question of availability has been
resolved against the claimant and since the record sustains this finding, it
must be affirmed. (December 27, 1955)</span></p>

significant because the Court sanctions the principle that under circumstances

before benefits can be paid.</span></p>
