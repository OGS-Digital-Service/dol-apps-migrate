attended at summer camp and participated in the required field training. They
were at all times subject to military discipline and were not permitted to be
absent from their assigned places of duty without first obtaining official
permission, which may be granted or denied as a matter of discretion. Claimants
could not Look for work during the periods in issue, but might have been
excused from further training had employment been offered to them. It is the
policy of the National Guard to permit such releases from further training in
the individual case, provided that no detriment to the training program is
expected to result on account thereof. Applications to be excused require the
approval of various unit commanders within the military establishment, any one
of whom may deny the request.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We do not agree with
the referee's conclusion, that claimants were available for employment, which
was based on the premise that they would have been released from military
training had employment been offered to them, according to statements from
their, respective company commanders. The evidence shows that approval of the
battalion commander, as well, was required, and in some cases even that of the
Division commander. Since approval was more than a mere formality, resting
within the sound discretion of the commander concerned, it is idle to speculate
as to what the decision would have been in any particular case if a job had
been offered to a guardsman applying for release from further training.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>There is, however, a
more serious and fundamental objection to the referee's decision, which
erroneously assumes that availability for employment exists merely because a
claimant is&nbsp;<u>willing&nbsp;</u>to work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Prior to 1953, there was
no statutory definition of availability for employment. What constituted
availability was decisional law on an ad hoc case by case basis. By Laws of
1953, Ch. 720, effective May 4, 1953, Section 591.2 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law was enacted. This Section reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Availability and
capability. No benefits shall be payable to any claimant who is not capable of
work or who is not&nbsp;<u>ready,</u>&nbsp;willing and able to work in his
usual employment or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training
and experience. (Underscoring supplied. )<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Conceding that claimants
were willing and able to work, there is no doubt that they were not&nbsp;<u>ready</u>&nbsp;to
work during their period of military training. The Law requires readiness to
work, not only in the event a job is offered, but at all reasonable times.
Claimants' military training precluded them from being ready at all times; the
availability requirement was not satisfied merely because there was a
possibility that they might be available on specified occasions when jobs might
be offered to them. Since claimants were at the summer camp for the purpose of
military training, rather than to look for work, they were withdrawn from the
labor market, no matter how praiseworthy or compelling their motives. Besides,
the requirement that a claimant be available for work includes the obligation
to make an independent search, the extent of which will vary with
circumstances; it is not sufficient merely to wait until employment is offered.
Claimants did not, indeed they could not, make an independent search for work
during the period in issue. The foregoing makes it clear that the cases cited in
the Industrial Commissioner's brief (Appeal Board #2387-40, #19,077-49 and
#21,025-49), insofar as they are based on the assumption that claimants engaged
in active military duty are available during such period if their releases may
be effected tor the purpose or accepting an offer of employment, are erroneous
in principle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The basic precedent was
established in Appeal Board, 2387-40 prior to any statutory definition of
availability. There, the Board found that an enlisted man in the National Guard
was ordered to camp for a two-week training period for which he received
maintenance and&nbsp;<u>one</u>&nbsp;dollar per day for incidental expenses and
that the established policy of the National Guard was to release men promptly
in all cases where an offer of employment was made to an enlisted man
unemployed at the time of entering training duties in camp. On those facts,
mindful of the then precedents which did not require an active search for work.
the Board found such claimant available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was decided after the enactment of Section 591.2 of the Law and after numerous
Board decisions requiring independent search for work in many cases as an overt
act to establish availability. There the Board held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>* * * The claimant in
the instant case is an officer. His release from active duty was not
established to exist as a&nbsp;<u>matter of right,</u>&nbsp;pursuant to a
predetermined policy prescribed for the benefit of unemployed officers
constituting the officers corps of which claimant was a member. Whether or not
claimant would have been able to effectuate his release from active duty was
dependent upon the approval first obtained from his commanding officer, whose
decision, as to whether an interview for possible job placement constituted a
valid and sufficient reason to relieve claimant from the obligations of his
orders,&nbsp;<u>admittedly was a matter resting solely within the commanding
officer's discretion</u>. Under such circumstances, the availability of
claimant for a timely interview, in the event a job referral were offered to
him, becomes highly speculative, since his application for a release from duty
was subject to the judgment of the person upon whose discretion he was
compelled to rely for a decision, and also to the possible contingency of
delay. This lack of a definite assurance of either an immediate release or
ultimate favorable action on his application makes the question of claimant's
availability at the time in issue highly doubtful. (underscoring supplied )<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant's release for employment herein depended on the discretion of not only
the commanding officer but in some instances on that of the battalion commander

release or ultimate favorable action. Claimants must be ruled unavailable to
the extent that the cases cited may be in conflict with this opinion, they are
hereby overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Although there is no
initial determination to that effect and although the Industrial Commissioner's
supplemental memorandum on appeal urges, for reasons of policy, that claimants
be found to be unavailable for employment, rather than not totally unemployed,
there is grave doubt whether they were in fact totally unemployed. They
received substantial payments in return for the services which they performed.
They were treated, both by National Guard and Federal government authorities,
for whose account taxes were deducted from their earnings, in a similar fashion,
as employees. Absent the fact that such moneys were derived from military
service, there is no doubt that an initial determination of lack of total
unemployment would ordinarily issue. Decision on such question would appear to
be unnecessary, however, since claimants, by initial determinations of the
local offices were properly found to be not available for employment. (See
Appeal Board, 52,319-55 wherein the Board found lack of total unemployment in
similar circumstances).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner and of the
employer appeared and testified. Claimant, a taxi driver, filed for benefits
effective December 15, 1958, and refiled effective February 16, 1959. By
initial determination effective December 6, 1958, he was disqualified for 42
consecutive calendar days for voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause. Effective December 22, 1958 through February 15, 1959, he was ruled
ineligible for failure to comply with reporting requirements. By initial
determination amended at the hearing, effective February 21, 28 and March 1, he
was ruled ineligible for lack of total unemployment on those days. His benefits
were ruled to be forfeited for 40 effective days because of a willful false
statement to obtain benefits. Claimant was employed as a taxi driver for about
three or four months to December 5,1958, on a commission basis. He resigned
because he did not believe he was getting sufficient work. He was required to
shape up daily and he was given work whenever there was a taxi available. He
could have remained at his job had he so desired. He had no immediate and
definite prospect of employment elsewhere at the time he left. Claimant
reported to the lnsurance office on December 16 and filed an original claim for
benefits. At that time he was informed by a representative of the insurance
office that he did not have sufficient weeks of employment during his base
period to qualify for unemployment insurance. On December 29 a notice of
determination was mailed to him advising him of his nonentitlement to benefits
because of lack of sufficient weeks of employment in his base period. This
notice informed him that he was to continue to report to the insurance office
as directed in the event he disagrees with the initial determination. Claimant
did not report to the insurance office thereafter until February 16, at which
time he established his entitlement to benefits. He was not misled or
misdirected by any representative of the insurance office. Claimant worked on
February 21 during the statutory week ending February 22. During the statutory
week ending March 1 he worked on February 28 and March 1, earning approximately
$21.30. He reported to the insurance office on March 3 and on that date
certified that he was totally unemployed during the statutory week ending
February 22 and March 1. The insert to his insurance booklet was marked with
letter &quot;N&quot; for the days on which he worked. He made one certification
on March 3 for the two statutory weeks ending February 22 and March 1. The
initial determination of wilful misrepresentation is based upon the falsity of
this certification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant advanced no
meritorious reason for leaving his job on December 5. Although he was not
getting steady work, he was permitted to work when there was a cab available
for him. The Unemployment Insurance Law makes no distinction between part-time
and full-time employment. Since he had no immediate prospect of employment
elsewhere at the time he left, he was correctly disqualified for voluntary
leaving of employment without good cause under the law. Claimant advanced no
meritorious reason for not reporting to the insurance office between December
22 and February 15. The notice of initial determination which was mailed to him
advised him to continue to report as directed wile he was attempting to
establish the validity of his claim. His failure to report to the insurance
office as required during the period in issue was due to his negligence.
Accordingly, he was correctly ruled ineligible for failure to comply with
reporting requirements during the period. Since claimant conceded he worked on
February 21, 28 and March 1, he was correctly ruled ineligible for lack of
total unemployment on those days. I reject his contention that he erroneously
reported total unemployment on those days because of a &quot;mistake&quot;. The
credible evidence establishes that he knowingly made a false statement for the
purpose of obtaining benefits. I reject the contention of the Industrial
Commissioner's representative that claimant's wilful misrepresentation must be
treated as two separate false statements, since he certified incorrectly to two
weeks of unemployment. Claimant made one false statement and his benefits
should be forfeited on the basis of one false certification and not of two
certifications. The initial determinations of voluntary leaving of employment and
of failure to comply with reporting requirements are sustained. The initial
determination of lack of total unemployment, as amended is sustained. The
initial determination of wilful misrepresentation is modified to the extent
that the forfeiture is reduced from 40 to 20 effective days, and as modified is
sustained. (April 2, 1959).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: These are cross
appeals from the decision of the referee filed April 2, 1959. The Industrial
Commissioner appeals from the said decision insofar as it modifies the initial
determination of the local office holding that claimant, a taxi driver,
wilfully made false statements to obtain benefits by reason of which a
forfeiture of 40 effective days was imposed as a penalty in reduction of claimant's
future benefit rights, by reducing the number of effective days to be forfeited
as a penalty from 40 to 20. The claimant appeals from said decision insofar as
it sustains the initial determinations of the local office (1) holding claimant
ineligible to receive benefits effective December 22, 1958 through February 15,
1959, on the ground that he failed to comply with reporting requirements, (2)
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive calendar days
effective December 6, 1958 on the ground that he voluntarily left his
employment without good cause and (3) holding that claimant wilfully made false
statements to obtain benefits, by reason of which a forfeiture of 40 effective
days was imposed as a penalty in reduction of claimant's future benefit rights,
as modified by the referee to reduce the number of effective days to be
forfeited as a penalty from 40 to 20 days, on the ground that claimant's wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits was a single offense. A hearing was held
before the referee at which all parties appeared and were accorded a full
opportunity to be heard. The Board considered the brief submitted on behalf of
the Industrial Commissioner and the written statement submitted by claimant on
appeal. After a review of the record including testimony and evidence adduced
before the referee and deliberation having been had thereon, and having found
that the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law are fully supported
by the record in this case, and that no errors of fact or law appear to have
been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law
made by the referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the
Board. The Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact
and correctly determined the issues involved in this case. The decision of the
referee is affirmed. (May 29, 1959).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at this time and that fact, among other reasons, prompted claimant to advise
her supervisor at that time that she preferred not to take any time off for

vacation periods were adjudicated and since there was no statutory guide as to
the policy of the State, the varying facts in each case produced different
results. (See e.g&nbsp;<u>Matter of Naylor</u>&nbsp;306 N.Y. 794 rev'g Appeal
Board, 30,727-52;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Chichipas&nbsp;</u>3 App. Div. 2d 880 aff'g
UCV217-55 and&nbsp;<u>Matter of Dresher</u>, 286 App.Div.591 rev'g Appeal Board
47,603-54.) After considerable study and consultation with representatives of
labor and management and the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council, the
Legislature enacted Section 591.3 to systematize and regulate the eligibility
status of unemployment insurance applicants during so-called vacation periods
and to reduce to a minimum the controversies on this subject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We feel it would do
violence to the purpose and intent of the Law as well as to the public policy
of the State to construe the vacation period provisions of the Law in such
manner as to justify the referee's decision. It is common knowledge that the
vast majority of employing establishments throughout the State, especially the
smaller ones, do not designate vacation periods in writing. Such arrangements
are frequently made orally between supervisors and workers. Typical of these
situations is the usual vacation arrangements for the vast majority of clerical
and executive employees. Rarely is there a written formal designation of the
annual vacation period. If the referee's construction of Section 591.3 of the
Law were accepted such employees would be deemed to suffer &quot;unemployment
for which benefits are payable&quot;. It is obvious that the Legislature never
contemplated such a result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We interpret that part
of Section 591.3(f) which requires a written designation to apply only in those
instances where a contemplated plant shut down or a mass lay off for vacation
purposes makes it reasonable to expect the employer to communicate that fact to
the entire staff in writing in advance. We believe that the Legislature did not
intend to create an escape hatch to allow payment of unemployment insurance
benefits simultaneously with vacation pay in situations as in this case. We
deem it sufficient that the vacation period herein was so designated by the
employer and the claimant in advance and we further hold that the omission of
the writing does not render the section ineffectual. We hold that claimant is
not entitled to receive benefits for the period August 4 through August 17, 1958
on the ground that such interval constituted a paid vacation period and
consequently she was not totally unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

advanced by the claimant lack validity. If the work of a pipe coverer in the
marine industry constituted the same occupation as that performed by a pipe
coverer in the building and construction industry, there might be merit to the
contention advanced by claimant. However, recognition must be given to the
facts that the industries are separate and distinct and, despite the similarity
of the work performed by a pipe coverer in each of the industries, they are ,
in truth, separate occupations. This Board has been called upon previously to
determine whether work in the marine industry was different work from that
performed in the building and construction industry and in Appeal Board,

building and construction electrician is employed in a distinct and
well-recognized trade, namely, the building and construction trade. A marine
electrician is employed in a different and separate trade, that is, the
shipbuilding trade. The two industries are wholly independent of each other. It
is true that many of the skills possessed by building and construction
electricians may be utilized in jobs as marine electricians. However, this fact
alone does not destroy the essential differences between the two occupations.
Each occupation, for long past, has been and still is designated by the United
States Employment Service under separate occupational code classifications to
wit: for building and construction electricians the code is 4-97.010, while;
for marine electricians, it is 4-97.210. The modes and methods of operation and
the types of locale for the performance of the work in the building and
construction field are different from those in the ship building field. Each
trade has its own union. Each has a different union rate of pay, the difference
being a very substantial one, seventy-five cents per hour greater for building
and construction electricians. The difference between the two occupations is
further revealed by the fact that two separate stabilization agreements were
executed between the representatives of the United States Government, management
and labor, one for building and construction defense projects and the other
confined to exclusively to shipbuilding. We believe that when a building and
construction electrician is referred to a job as a marine electrician, he is
being referred to a job in a &quot;different occupation&quot; within the
intendment of said procedure….<o:p></o:p></span></p>

apparent that the work offered to claimant in the marine industry must be
deemed to be different work from that performed in the building and
construction industry. We are not unmindful that unlike the occupation of
electrician the marine pipe coverer is not separate occupationally classified
from the building and construction asbestos worker or pipe coverer. We do not
deem that fact to be significant in or controlling in view of the realities of
the situation as evinced by the practices in the trades and the distinctions
recognized by the unions having jurisdiction over the affected workers.
Consequently, the test with regard to the adequacy of the wage offered to
claimant is that which prevails for similar work in the marine industry. The
record establishes conclusively that the wage offered to the claimant was not
substantially less favorable to him than that prevailing for work similar to
that which was offered him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must be determined on the basis of the entire industry (Appeal Board 6,624-41

with that rule. The fallacy in claimant's argument is that he overlooks the
difference between the two industries and seeks to justify his refusal of the
offered employment on the ground that the wages offered to him are lower than
those prevailing in a different industry, notwithstanding the fact that such
wages compare favorably with the wages paid in the industry in which he was

He moved from one field to the other freely and did exactly the same work whether
he worked in a shipyard or in building construction. It is conclusive to us
that a pipe coverer is in a single occupation regardless of the particular
industry in which his services are employed. This is a common situation in many
occupations, notably in the clerical field. Stenographers, typist, clerks,
messengers, or office boys although constituting distinct and separate
occupations, may be employed in many varied industries. Yet, for unemployment

9576-43, the facts were markedly different. There, the claimant who lived in
The Bronx City of New York had 20 years experience as a building and construction
electrician. He never had performed any ship work. He was offered jobs in
shipyards in Kearney and Port Newark, New Jersey , at a rate of pay about
one-half the union rate in his industry. The Board found that the travel time
from his home to the prospective employers was at least two hours each way and
that the increased travel fare was more than 100 per cent greater than in his
previous job. The electricians in the building and construction industry
belonged to a union separate from the union to which ship electricians
belonged. The Board based its decision in justifying the claimant's refusal of
the offered jobs on many grounds. It found that there was good cause for
refusal because of excessive travel time and excessive travel expense. It also
concluded that the Industrial Commissioner's wartime policy of allowing at
least 30 days for construction workers to find employment in their own
occupation before being subjected to disqualification for refusing work in a
different occupation, had not been followed in that case when the shipyard
offers were made 13 days after claimant filed for benefits. The Board also
concluded that electrical work in building and construction was a distinct and
different trade from that of electrical work in shipyards; that each trade was
independent of the other; that although there were some similarities common to
both there were essential differences between the two occupations; that both
occupations had different classifications in the Dictionary of Occupational

in the cited cases a pipe coverer is not employed in a different separate trade
when he works interchangeably in shipyards and in buildings. While the ship
industry may be different from the building and construction industry, the

worker, filed a claim effective September 1, 1958. By initial determinations
respectively effective August 9, September 24 and October 6, she was, in each
instance, disqualified for 42 consecutive calendar days, the first initial
determination being by reason of voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause, and the others, because of refusal of employment without good cause.
Claimant is 44 years old. She was employed for approximately one year in a
union shop. She was a member of the union. She was paid on a piece work basis
with a minimum of 97-1/2 cents an hour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

instructed to report back for work when able to do so. Claimant thereafter, did
not report back to work. She was offered re-employment when she was physically
able to work with the same employer, by the insurance office on September 24

willing to re-employ claimant. Claimant, in each instance, refused to return to

with her former employer on December 1, 1958 and January 28, 1959 respectively
and on each of the said occasions she refused the offer for the identical
reason which caused her to refuse the earlier offers. Additional initial
determinations were issued disqualifying claimant for 42 days beginning with
December 1 and for 42 days beginning with January 28, 1959 for refusal of
employment without good cause. Claimant protested the initial determination
effective December 1, 1958 and the said initial determination was sustained by
the referee in Case 538-550-58R (Appeal Board 68,640-59).The initial
determination with respect to the refusal of January 28 was rescinded as a
result of a policy promulgated by the Commissioner subsequent to the refusal of
December 1, 1958 because she erroneously believed that her pending appeal from
the decision in Case 538-452-58R (Appeal Board, 67,153-58) would review the
adverse decisions of both referees. The Board on its own motion, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 620.3 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, decided
to review the decision in Case 538-550-58R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

representatives have advised that, subsequent to the refusal of December 1, but
prior to the refusal of January 8, 1959 the employment office representatives
were instructed to avoid making successive referrals of specific jobs
previously refused by a claimant for the reason that it was concluded that to
do so would be contrary to sound employment and employment service practices.
It was pointed out, however, that notwithstanding such instructions in the
event such successive offers are actually made by the employer to a claimant,
the disqualification provided for in Section 593.2 of the Law must be imposed
separately each time that the offer is refused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The penalty resulting
from a refusal of employment without good cause has been fixed and established
as a result of the amendment to the Law which became effective June 30, 1958
(Laws of 1958, Chapter 387). As a result of such amendment, the disqualification
is no longer a continuing one which can be terminated only by subsequent
employment, but is for a specific period of 42 days commencing with the day on
which the refusal occurred. It was made clear by the inclusion of subdivision 4
in the amended statute that the disqualification period is measured by the
calendar and is not affected by subsequent employment. It is obvious that by
such amendment the Legislature intended to provide for a standard penalty which
would be applied against an applicant for benefits who without good cause,
refused employment and that it was never contemplated that the penalty could be
made more severe or more extensive by the medium of re-offering the same
employment to the claimant repeatedly. If there were any other construction of
the statute in its amended form, the very purpose thereof would be rendered
nugatory, since a claimant could be disqualified permanently merely by the
device of re-offering one specific job to which the claimant has objection even
though such objection be without legal basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Section 593 of the Law, we held that separate disqualifications were
applicable in the instance of successive refusals of the same job offer.
However, the reason which formed the basis for our decision to that effect in
appeal Board, 43,382-54, has no application under the present section of the
Law. We pointed out in our decision that there was no prohibition on the
imposition of successive disqualifications because under the then existing
statute, each of the earlier disqualifications had necessarily become
terminated by intervening employment before the re-offer was made. It was a
facile thing under the prior statute for claimants to engage in work of short
duration and then immediately refile, thus overcoming the disqualification
which resulted from an earlier refusal of employment. This is no longer
possible and consequently, it is our present view that a re-offer of the same
employment followed by a similar refusal thereof is merely a repetition of the
single prior act involving the identical offer and refusal. In such
circumstance the logic we adopted with regard to the repetition of wilful
misrepresentations on separate occasions is applicable. In such instances, we
held that there was but a single offense which warranted the imposition of only
a single penalty rather than successive penalties. Our holding to that effect
in Appeal Board, 9691-43 was affirmed in the&nbsp;<u>Matter of Roberts</u>, 276
App. Div. 845.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

conflict with&nbsp;<u>Matter of Crowe</u>, 305 N.Y. 699 reversing Appeal Board
28,204-51 wherein it was held that the statute authorized a separate
disqualification for the refusal of the identical job which the claimant had
voluntarily left without good cause and for which a disqualification had been
imposed. In accord with the principle enunciated in the&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Crowe,</u>&nbsp;supra, we have here concluded that the disqualification imposed
for claimant's first refusal of the re-offer of employment on September 24,
1958 is proper since her refusal was an act separate and distinct from her
leaving of the employment in the first instance. However, the principle which
requires the application of the disqualifications under Sections 593.1 and
593.2 are not applicable where the successive disqualifications are issued
under the provisions of Section 593.2 based on successive refusals of the
identical job. In the latter event there would clearly be a double or triple or
even greater penalty for the same act. The acts of refusal are not separable in
the statutory scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

owned by the employer. The employer is a member of an association which is in
contractual relations with a union of which claimant is a member. The contract
provides for an eight-hour workday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Tugboats are usually in
operation on a 24-hour basis. Consequently, each tugboat is manned by three
separate crews, each of which is required to be on duty during eight hours of
each workday. Because of the nature of their work, tugboat workers are usually
away from home throughout the workweek. To enable them to return to their
respective homes at intervals, the tugboat workers, by agreement among
themselves and with the acquiescence of the tugboat operators, have developed
the practice which prevails in the industry whereby each of the workers is on
duty 12 hours on each work day for two successive weeks and is relieved from
duty during the following week. Thus, in each three-week cycle the worker is on
duty an aggregate of 120 working hours on ten workdays. This practice prevails
notwithstanding the contractual provision fixing an eight-hour workday and
without regard to the activity of the employer’s business. No overtime or
premium compensation is paid for the hours of work in excess of eight hours on
any day in those instances where the additional hours of duty are undertaken by
the worker in pursuance of the practice mentioned, but, in accordance with the
terms of the collective bargaining agreement, workers are compensated at premium
rates for work in excess of eight hours on any day when such work is demanded
by the employer because of illness or absence of a crew member, shortage of
staff or other emergency. Some employers whose employees work in accordance
with this practice pay their employees remuneration for 40 hours of work in
each week, including the week in which the employee is relieved from duty. In
other instances, the employees receive straight hourly wages for the total work
time of 60 hours in each of the weeks during which they are on duty and receive
no wages during the weeks in which they are relieved from duty. In the instant
case, the claimant was paid according to the latter method and hence, he
received no wage payment for the week in issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

collective bargaining agreement, the employer is required to make certain
weekly payments for each of its employees into specific funds to provide death
benefits, non-occupational accident and sickness benefits, hospital and
surgical expense reimbursements and benefits of a pension plan. The employer is
obliged to make such weekly payments only for each employee in its employ
during the week for which the payment is made. Such payments are actually made
by the employer for those of its employees who are relieved from duty in
accordance with the practice herein above mentioned, in the weeks in which such
employees are off duty and perform no services. Additionally, in determining
the vacation credits accrued by employees, the weeks in which they are off duty
are computed as periods of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pursuance of the above arrangement are responsible for the proper manning of
the vessel to the extent, at least, of holding themselves in readiness to
resume work immediately during the off duty week in the event that their
opposite number, i.e., the crew member due to perform the work of the absent
member, is unable or unwilling to work in that week. In that event, if the
absent employee is summoned to return to work and fails to make an immediate
return, he is subject to discharge. In the event, however, that an employee is
on a lay off status due to lack of work, he is allowed one week after receiving
notice of recall to report for the resumption of work. If an employee is
recalled to work during his off week because of the absence of his opposite
number, he is paid wages at straight time but the opposite number forfeits
those wages. If, during an employee’s off week, a vacancy occurs on a vessel
other than that to which the employee is regularly assigned, the employer may
provide the employee with the opportunity to work as a replacement so that he
can earn the additional wages, but the employee is under no obligation to
accept that assignment. He may not, during the off week, enter the employment
of any other tugboat operator who is a party to the collective bargaining
agreement, but he is free to accept temporary work otherwise, so long as he
holds himself in readiness to respond to immediate recall should the need
therefor arise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recalled by the employer nor was he offered assignment by it to any other

status of tugboat workers during the off week and except for our decision in

eligible for benefits. (See Appeal Board, 38,516-53, 43,058-54 and 61,641-57).
The evidence before us in the earlier cases was not as clear as has now been
presented to indicate the true nature of the arrangement which results in the
pattern of off weeks for tugboat workers. We believe that in view of our
present understanding of the situation gleaned from the evidence adduced
herein, a review of our disposition of these matters is in order.
Significantly, the Commissioner’s view is that the circumstances of claimant’s
unemployment during the off weeks indicate claimant’s ineligibility for such
periods, but, nevertheless, a contrary initial determination was issued only
because the Commissioner deemed himself bound by our decision in Appeal Board,
61,641-57.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the tugboat worker who participates in an arrangement whereby, for his own
convenience, he is enabled to accumulate his normal 120 hours of work for a
three-week period in a period of two weeks and thus be relieved of the
necessity for performing work in the third weeks, is not eligible for benefits
within the purview of the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law for the
reason that he has temporarily withdrawn from the labor market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bargaining agreement between claimant’s union and his employer contemplates
that in each three-week period claimant’s full employment would consist of work
for 120 hours and that his wages would consist of 120 times his basic hourly rate.
Since claimant was provided with work for 120 hours and was paid 120 times his
basic hourly rate during the three-week period which included his off week, it
would not be within the spirit of the Unemployment Insurance Law to award to
him unemployment insurance benefits to supplement his earnings in the week
during which he was idle, only because his arrangements with his fellow workers
enabled him to accumulate his hours of work and remuneration in a shorter time
so that he could enjoy a respite from work during each third week. In so
stating, we emphasize that this conclusion is dictated by the arrangement which
is peculiar to this occupation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

42 consecutive calendar days for refusal of employment without good cause and
charging claimant with having wilfully made a false statement to obtain benefits
thereby reducing her right to future benefits by 24 effective days to be
forfeited and further charging claimant with an overpayment of benefits in the
sum of $66 which was held to be recoverable. The claimant objected thereto and
requested a hearing. A hearing was thereafter held before the referee on
September 17, 1959. The referee rendered a decision dated September 28, 1959
sustaining those portions of the initial determination which charged claimant
with having wilfully made a false statement to obtain benefits and which ruled
that the overpayment was recoverable. The Industrial Commissioner thereupon
appealed to the Board from the decision of the referee insofar as it overruled
the initial determination of the local office that the overpayment of $66 in

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: On June 15, 1959, the employment office
referred claimant to employment in her usual occupation at prevailing wages and
conditions. Claimant accepted the referral, reported to the employer on June
16, 1959 but refused the employment because she was not satisfied with the
condition of the premises and for other personal reasons which do not
constitute good cause under the Law. The employment interviewer who referred
claimant to the employment made an entry in claimant’s identification booklet,
in the appropriate space provided therefor, indicating that the referral had
after, on claimant’s regularly assigned reporting date in the two succeeding
weeks, claimant reported to the insurance office and certified for benefits for
the week in which the referral had occurred and for the following week. When
she so certified in each instance, claimant presented to the claims clerk, as
part of her certification for benefits, her identification booklet, containing
the entry with regard to the referral as aforesaid. The established procedure
requires a claims clerk to examine the placement section of claimant’s
identification booklets to become aware of all entries therein. Notwithstanding
the entry with respect to the referral of June 16, claimant was not
specifically interrogated until July 7 about the outcome of the referral and
the initial determination disqualifying her for the refusal of employment was
not issued until that day. In the meantime, based on claimant’s certifications
on June 23 and June 30, benefits aggregating $66 were paid to her for the weeks
ending June 21 and June 28. Accordingly, such payments constituted an
overpayment on the basis of the retroactive initial determination issued on
July 7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on June 23 and June 30, she signed the usual certification forms which, among
other things, contained printed thereon the statement &quot;I notified this

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In our previous decision we ruled that the
overpayment was recoverable on the theory that since claimant had made no oral
mention of the referral of June 16, her signature on the printed form
indicating that she had notified the office of all job offers, constituted a
false statement which precluded a waiver of the recovery of the overpayment.
Upon consideration we arrive at a conclusion contrary to that previously made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Our review satisfies us
that the entry with regard to the referral which appeared in claimant’s
identification booklet when she presented it to the claims clerk at the times
of her certifications, was in fact a notification of the job offer made by the
employment office on the date so indicated. Inasmuch as such entry constituted
an integral part of claimant’s certifications, the entry was notification to
the insurance office of such job offer. Viewed in this light, it is apparent
that since claimant did, in effect, give notification of the job offer of June
16 by the presentation of the booklet, she did in truth notify the local office
of the job offer which she had received. Consequently, the certification
contained on the printed form was not false.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>There is nothing in the
record purporting to indicate that when claimant certified between the date of
the referral and her certifications on June 23 and June 30 respectively, she
knew that a disqualification would result from her refusal of the employment or
that as a result thereof she would be disqualified from receiving benefits for
the weeks ending June 21 and June 28. It follows that there has been no showing
that claimant lacked good faith in the acceptance of such payments. Similarly,
since as we have found, she affirmatively indicated by the presentation of her
booklet that the offer of employment had been made on June 16, it is apparent
that there was no wilful concealment of that fact. Under these circumstances,
the issuance of the initial determination retroactively does not affect
claimant’s rights to the benefits theretofore paid to her. (Section 597.4 of
the Law)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

principal activity was &quot;amusement Center.&quot; On the basis of such

Penal Law prohibited the operation of a lottery within the State of New York
during the period here at issue. In&nbsp;<u>People vs. Kiefer</u>, 173 Misc.
300, an indictment against one who was accused of a violation of the lottery
statutes because he had acted as an officer, master of ceremonies and treasurer
for a bingo game operated under substantially similar conditions to those here
involved, was sustained on the theory that, irrespective of the name assigned
to the game and notwithstanding that it may have been conducted for the benefit
of a non-profit charitable organization, it, nevertheless, constituted a
&quot;lottery&quot; and was, therefore, an illegal pursuit. To the same effect,
since&nbsp;<u>People vs. Williams</u>, 202 Misc. 420, and&nbsp;<u>People vs.
Cadle</u>, 7 App. Div. 2d 65. In&nbsp;<u>People vs. Cadle</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>,
it was held that a violation of the lottery statute occurred even though it was
possible for persons to participate in the game without payment of any
consideration. Similarly, in&nbsp;<u>Italian Community Home Federation, Inc.
vs. Kelly</u>, 12 Misc. 2d 33, it was held that bingo games could not be
legally conducted even though such games were &quot;free&quot; following an
entertainment program for which an admission fee was charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the employment with which the claimants herein seek to be credited was
illegal. The nature of the services rendered by each of the claimants was such
that each of them was an active participant in the actual operation of the
illegal lottery. Under these circumstances, there is no merit to the argument
advanced by claimants that the illegality of their employment should be
overlooked because the local enforcement authorities had not disturbed the
operation of the bingo game. Significantly, each of the claimants became
unemployed because in their community &quot;commercial bingo halls&quot; were
closed at the time when charitable organizations were licensed to operate such
games in pursuance of the provisions of the State Lottery Control Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the employment with which claimants seek to be credited was, by its very
nature, illegal, it necessarily follows that the claimants may not be credited
therewith for the purpose of establishing eligibility for unemployment
insurance benefits. Under another social statute, namely, the Workmen’s
Compensation Law, the Courts have held that one who is injured in the course of
illegal employment may not receive the protection afforded to those who are
employed in legal activities. Thus, in&nbsp;<u>Herbold vs. Neff</u>, 200 App.

injured while employed in a saloon during prohibition. The court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other industries covered by the ILGWU which have retirement funds and
reciprocity provisions. Under Article IV Section 1A of said rules, it is
provided that females between the ages of 62 and 65 who meet the employment
requirements may retire and receive reduced benefits. The only interruption of
employment which would not deprive claimant of credit as periods of employment
are interruptions due to disability, lack of work or military service. Claimant
elected to file her application for retirement in September 1959, at which time
she would have had two years continuous employment. She could not obtain
retirement through Local 98 had she accepted the job offer, because Local 98
has no retirement plan. Had claimant accepted the job offer, her two years’
continuous employment prior to her retirement would have been broken and
claimant would be required to work for two more continuous years in a shop
governed by Local 20.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sustaining the initial determination, the referee relied upon our decision in

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is true that
acceptance of the offered employment would not interfere with the retention of
claimant’s membership in her union and she cannot rely upon subdivision (a) of
Section 593.2 of the Law to spell out statutory good cause for her refusal of
the employment. However, the Law does not limit good cause for refusal of
employment to the specific circumstances recited in the several subdivisions of
the above section. On the contrary, it is clearly provided in the statute that
the disqualification shall apply on if the refusal is &quot;without good
cause.&quot; There are no limitations in the statute on the particular
circumstances or situations which may be deemed to constitute &quot;good
cause.&quot; The Law merely delineates four separate conditions which
shall,&nbsp;<u>as a matter of law</u>, be deemed to constitute &quot;good
cause.&quot; If the reasons relied upon by the claimant for the refusal of
employment are not such as to preclude a finding of lack of good cause&nbsp;<u>as
a matter of law</u>, the reasons so advanced must be considered to determine
whether, in the particular case, good cause existed&nbsp;<u>as a matter of fact</u>.
We have held that among many other reasons there is good cause to refuse
employment if acceptance thereof would affect adversely a claimant’s health
(Appeal Board, 10,062-43) or would endanger a claimant’s safety and would be
hazardous to a claimant on account of age (Appeal Board, 10,152-43; 13,221-46)
or handicap (Appeal Board, 16,936-48) or would be in violation of a claimant’s
religious scruples (Appeal Board, 34,048-52). Such conclusions are founded upon
findings of fact supported by credible and convincing evidence. In substance,
the test in such circumstances is whether a reasonably prudent person,
genuinely attached to the labor market, would be impelled to reject the
employment under the conditions which confronted the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Applying that test to
the facts herein, the conclusion is compelled that claimant’s refusal of the
offer was with good cause because of the substantial detriment which would have
resulted otherwise. In view of claimant’s advanced age, the fact that by her
past labors she had earned the right to retire and receive a pension within
five months after the date of the offer herein, and the fact that she had
already elected to avail herself of that right, claimant had sound and valid
reasons constituting &quot;good cause&quot; to avoid any act which would have
produced a forfeiture of that right or would have interfered with her exercise
thereof. Since acceptance of the offered employment would have immediately
deprived claimant of the right to receive her pension at the time she was due
to retire and would have made it necessary for her to either forfeit the
pension entirely or else postpone her retirement until she could again procure
employment in her industry and continue therein for at least two additional
years, she acted reasonably and with good cause when she refused the offer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguishable from those found in our decision in Appeal Board, 42,766-54,
relied upon by the referee. In the cited case, we specifically pointed out that
there would have been no loss of retirement benefits unless the claimant worked
outside of the industry for a consecutive period of 24 months and that material
prejudice to claimant was unlikely since his retirement benefits remained
unaffected so long as he had 26 weeks of employment with an employer who was a
contributor to the pension fund. Moreover, in the cited case claimant’s
retirement was not imminent and acceptance of the offered employment would not
have compelled the claimant either to forfeit the pension or postpone his
retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Association of Machinists commenced a strike at this plant and established a
picket line. The strike continued until August 26, 1959, at which time the
employees returned to work. The claims herein followed the seven-week
suspension period set forth in the Unemployment Insurance Law for loss of
employment due to strike; 183 of the employees of the employer herein filed

&quot;No benefits shall be paid to members who refuse to do the duties assigned
to them by those in charge of the strike.&quot; The union strike fund from
which payments are made is accumulated by a per capita tax. Payments from their
fund were made to the strikers commencing with the second week of the strike.
The first payment was $35 and thereafter, $10 weekly. Most of the workers
picketed several hours a week. Pursuant to the constitution only those
employees who were members of the union for six months could qualify for the
strike-benefit payment from the union. Although the union sought to have all
the members picket during the strike, payments were made to some of the members
who did not picket. Several members of the union who were ill received strike

no believe that the strike benefits were in any real sense in payment of the

came from a fund to which the appellants had contributed and might be
analogized to savings funds or to private insurance for which they had paid the
premiums. The amount of benefits, although dependent on marital status, had no
relation to the nature or extent of their Trentonian services. If they were at
home sick or were fulfilling other strike duties, such as picketing, they
received the same benefits. ***It is true, as the Board indicated, that the
strikers were required to perform assigned duties and would not receive their
benefits if they declined without reason. That, however, would appear to be
simply an exercise of union discipline rather than an indication that the
benefits were paid as wages or remuneration for services rendered. ***This
construction is fully consonant with the broad remedial objectives of the

claimant’s previous work record she was classified incorrectly as an assistant
bookkeeper (bookkeeper III). In our opinion claimant’s experience and duties
which she performed in her previous employments indicate that she should be
classified as a clerk, accounting, class A (public utility). In any even
claimant’s skills gained by wide experience are higher than those used as a
standard in determining the occupational classification of assistant
bookkeeper, (bookkeeper III). The employment service’s representative conceded
at the last hearing before the Board that claimant’s skills gained by wide
experience could fit the occupational classification of clerk, accounting,
Class A, as set forth in the wage survey made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
of the United States Department of Labor in which the standard weekly earnings
in public utility establishments were found to be $76.50. It is significant to
note that the Industrial Commissioner contended (through the testimony of the
Employment Service representative) that the classifications of bookkeeper III
and clerk, accounting, class A are comparable. The Federal survey covers a much
wider field as to the number of employees involved than does an occupational
wage survey used by the insurance office as a guide made in October 1955. It
covers 2072 employees and indicates that the median salary for bookkeeper III
was $65 per week. We choose to rely on the Federal survey as our guide in
determining the prevailing wage in the locality for a person with claimant’s
training and experience. Had claimant accepted the offered employment, the
maximum wage she could have expected to receive was $65 per week. This is at
least 15 percent less than the rate prevailing in the locality for similar
work, according to the Federal survey. In our opinion, the salary offered was
substantially less than the prevailing rate. (Appeal Board 37,695-53)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the wages for the position offered were less than those prevailing for
similar work on grounds which seem to us tenuous at best. First, it cites and
finds &quot;significant&quot; certain testimony that the classification of
assistant bookkeeper and of clerk, accounting, class A (without the addition
&quot;[public utility]&quot;) are &quot;comparable&quot; and then refers to a
Federal survey indicating earnings in the latter position of $76.50&nbsp;<u>in
public utility establishments</u>, while ignoring the fact that the same survey
indicated a prevailing wage of $66.50 for Class A accounting clerks in service
institutions (such as the hospital in which the disputed position was offered)
and an average of $69.50 for such clerks generally. While claimant had indeed
been employed by a utility and had been paid $73, certainly in a case such as
this, involving work of a nature utilized in all industries, the determination
of prevailing rate under subdivision &quot;d&quot; is not to be reached upon
the application of so narrow a test as that afforded by a particular industry;
absent proof of some unusual or exceptional factor or condition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Our decision in Appeal
Board, 65,918-58 is decisive of the issue in this case. There also the
claimant’s attempted refiling on a day of the week preceding his regular
reporting day was not accepted and the claimant failed to return to the local
office in the week in question. The Board’s decision holding that claimant was
entitled to have his claim made effective as of the date of the attempted fling
reads in part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

*In the instant case, it is undisputed that in the week for which claimant
seeks to be credited with a refiling of his claim, he did visit the insurance
office and applied for such refiling. He was at the insurance office on
Tuesday, April 29, for that specific purpose. Notwithstanding the fact that
claimant did not again report to the insurance office in that same week in
accordance with the instructions given to him when he visited the insurance
office on April 29, claimant may not be denied the right to refile his claim,
nor may he be deprived of credit for his registered days of unemployment in
that week. Under the provisions of the statute (Section 596), the
Commissioner’s representatives are required to credit an applicant for benefits
with the filing of his claim when application therefore is made. The
Commissioner is authorized to promulgate regulations with respect to
registration and reporting requirements but such regulations are valid only
insofar as they implement the statutory provision. The regulations may not be
so construed as to deprive an applicant for benefits of a right conferred upon
him by statute. In pursuance of his authority, the Industrial Commissioner
promulgated Regulation 40 pertaining to the filing of claims. It is provided in
such regulation that an applicant for benefits shall file an additional claim
&quot;in the week for which he expects benefits if his claim has lapsed because
of intervention of any week in which he accrued no effective days.* * *&quot;
It is further provided that such additional claim should be filed on the
regular report day assigned to the applicant and that a claim so filed shall be
deemed filed as of the first day of his unemployment occurring in that week and
that if he is employed on his regular reporting day, the additional claim shall
be filed on the next day of unemployment occurring in that week. The regulation
specifically provides that a claim so filed &quot;shall be deemed filed as of
the first day of his unemployment occurring in such week,&quot; and that
&quot;if such requirement is not met, but an additional claim is filed
subsequently in the same week, the claimant may not be credited with any days
of total unemployment preceding the day on which such additional claim was
filed.&quot;&nbsp;<u>It is obvious from the language used in the quoted
regulation that a claimant’s failure to file an additional claim on his
regularly assigned reporting day does not result in his ineligibility to claim
credit for all effective days in that week. The only effect of the regulation
is that his failure to file on his regularly assigned reporting day deprives
him of credit for the days of the week which precede his actual visit to the
insurance office</u>. The regulation makes reference to the filing of an
additional claim on a day &quot;subsequent&quot; to the reporting day, but
makes no reference to the effect of a report on a day&nbsp;<u>prior</u>&nbsp;to
the assigned reporting day. Under these circumstances, there is not authority
to deny to the claimant the refiling to which he was entitled when he reported
to the insurance office on Tuesday, April 29. Since that was not his regularly
assigned reporting day, he is not entitled to have his claim made effective on
any day prior to the day of his actual visit. His visit on April 29 entitled
him to a refiling effective April 29. (Underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

regulations 40 and 41. Regulation 41 provides: &quot;each claimant shall report
and certify to his unemployment, at specified days and hours established for
him by the unemployment insurance office&quot;; and regulation 40 provides that
any additional claim by a claimant &quot;shall be filed on his regular
reporting day assigned to him in accordance with regulation 41&quot; and
further provides that compliance therewith &quot;may&quot; be excused.
Respondent does not contest the validity or reasonableness of the regulations
which, indeed, and in view of the vast number of claims presented, appear
necessary in order to assign times evenly through this week and to avoid the
burden and confusion which would attend the appearance of an undue proportion
of claimants on one particular day to be received by a staff provided for, and

His claim was not accepted and he was instructed to return on Friday, October
3, since Friday had been his assigned reporting day upon his original filing.
Claimant &quot;forgot&quot; to return on that day (the initial determination
later finding this to be &quot;negligence&quot;) and did not return on Monday,
October 6, before returning to work on that evening. Under regulation 40 any
claim timely filed, i.e., &quot;on his regular reporting day&quot;, would
&quot;be deemed filed as of the first day of his unemployment occurring in such

was of no effect and that his failure to appear and file on Friday, October 3
deprived him of benefits for the otherwise effective days in that week; and
that it would, of course, have been pointless for him to have appeared on the

obtaining benefits, when he stated, on February 4 and again on February 11 that
the last day that he had worked was February 2; and when he further stated that
the termination of that employment was involuntary. However, we do not agree

one forfeit penalty of 24 effective days should be imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

statements with regard to two different facts. He falsely reported the reason
for the termination of his job. He also falsely reported his employment status
on February 3. These separate and disassociated acts resulted in two separate
offenses committed for two different purposes; one to avoid disqualification
for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause and two, to obtain
benefits for total unemployment for a day on which claimant was employed. Each
offense carried a separate forfeiture. Under the standards established by the
Division of Employment and approved by the Board, the forfeiture is 24
effective days in an instance where a benefit payment results from the wilful
misrepresentation and 20 effective days where no payment is actually made. In
the instant case the two separate offenses resulted in a single benefit payment
and therefore, the aggregate forfeiture should be 44 effective days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a college in 1958 for one year. During his second year, he secured daytime
employment and attended college in the evenings. Between January and June,
1959, claimant had worked full-time as a laboratory technician. During the
summer of 1959 he had worked as a counselor in a summer camp. Following this
employment, he became re-employed as a laboratory technician and worked for two

employment as a steelworker on July 14 claimant remained continuously employed
through August 8, 1959. Had claimant suffered an ordinary layoff by the steel
mill on July 14 his continued employment at the restaurant would bar any claim
for unemployment insurance benefits on the ground that under the law he would
not be totally unemployed. Had claimant at the time of such lay off left his
restaurant employment, he would be chargeable with a disqualification for a
voluntary leaving without good cause of the restaurant employment. By the same
logic, claimant’s rights as of the date of his filing on August 10, 1959 must
be determined on the basis of his employment up to the time of his loss of the
restaurant employment. Section 592.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law provides
for a suspension of seven weeks for loss of employment due to a strike.
Claimant continued to be employed after the strike began. When he filed for
benefits on August 10, he was (totally unemployed) only because he lost his job
in the restaurant. We, accordingly, hold that under the circumstances herein
claimant did not lose his employment due to the steel strike. The initial determination
of the local office is overruled. The decision of the referee is reversed.

eight hours on December 15 on the shift which ended at midnight. That evening,
claimant was told that he would be laid off temporarily at the end of his

specifically provides that the unemployment insurance fund is to be used
&quot;for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their

that a person who had partial employment and earned more than $45 in any
calendar week was neither totally nor partially unemployed, during that week,
within the purview of the Law. Hence, such a person may not be credited with
the accumulation of any effective days and is ineligible to receive even a
partial benefit check. To countenance that which the claimant herein has
attempted would negate and frustrate the entire scheme under which benefits
have been provided for involuntary partial unemployment. The amendment of the
Law to provide for partial benefits to those who meet the conditions set forth
in Section 523 was designed to encourage workers to engage in whatever partial
employment was open to them and to earn as much wages as possible. One who
deliberately foregoes the opportunity of earning additional wages to keep
within the limitation for partial unemployment thereby places himself without
the scope of the provisions authorizing the payment of partial benefits and

as follows: He modified the initial determinations as to all claimants except

eligible for benefits effective July 7,1959 instead of effective June 1, 1959.
As to claimants Peterson, Maione and Hall, the referee sustained the initial
determinations of the local office holding them eligible to receive benefits
effective the respective dates of their filing therefor because they had been
laid off from employment by the employer prior to their attaining the
compulsory retirement age and had manifested their attachment to the labor
market upon filing for benefits following such layoffs. In addition to
modifying the initial determination affecting the claimant Gould by ruling him
eligible for benefits effective July 7, 1959, the referee modified the initial
determination of the local office by holding claimant Gould ineligible for
benefits from July 27 through August 2, 1959 on the ground that he was not
available for employment because he was absent from the area for personal
reasons. Finally, the referee overruled the initial determination of the local
office which held claimant Hitchcock eligible for benefits effective the date
of his filing therefor and ruled that claimant was not available for benefits
because he did not seek work diligently. The referee’s conclusion as to the
claimant Hitchcock was justified by the testimony given by that claimant before
him. However, at the hearing before the Board additional testimony was received
from claimant Hitchcock who established that, not only did he seek work
diligently, but he actually obtained work outside of his job classification for

legal effect of the consummation of this collective bargaining agreement is
that the claimants, through their union representatives, agreed, in advance,
that upon reaching the age of 68 each would&nbsp;<u>voluntarily</u>&nbsp;withdraw

from the time the employee attained the mandatory retirement age of 68. Here
the compulsory retirement had the effect of completely severing the
employer-employee relationship. Upon such severance the &quot;retired&quot;
employee became eligible to accept immediate employment elsewhere, on a
permanent basis. Unlike the instance of temporary unemployment produced by a

contentions, if accepted, would have the effect of adding to the Unemployment
Insurance Law, basis for ineligibility or disqualification not now included in
the Law. No agreement, even one between a union and an employer can change,
modify or add to the statutory provisions. A claimant’s eligibility for
benefits is spelled out by the provisions of the Law and cannot be bargained
away. Among other requisites to establish eligibility for benefits, a claimant
must prove that he is ready, willing and able to work in his usual employment
or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience.
Section 591.2 of the Law so provides. The employer’s contention that all of
these claimants withdrew from the labor market implies that the claimants were
not ready, willing and able to work. We have repeatedly ruled that proof of
readiness, willingness and ability to work may be manifested by diligent
efforts to find work. In these cases, the local office has satisfied itself
that each claimant came within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law
by demonstrating availability for employment. The evidence herein as to some of
these elderly claimants actually obtaining work in a highly competitive labor
market is most significant in proving their availability for work. Moreover,
the employer’s contention that none of the claimants made a&nbsp;<u>bona</u>&nbsp;<u>fide</u>&nbsp;return
to the labor market is negated by the credible and convincing proof adduced
herein which establishes that a number of these claimants obtained subsequent
employment at various trades and occupations after diligent search therefor.

at which he previously worked establishes that the employer recognized that

for unemployment insurance purposes to consider the amount a retired employee

entitled to so little monies upon their retirement must be taken into consideration
in determining whether or not claimants would, in fact, withdraw from the labor
market in reliance upon the monies they would receive under this pension plan.
The answer is obvious. The mere receipt of these meager sums did not convert

claim for benefits effective July 13, 1959. Claimant reported regularly
thereafter and certified weekly to total unemployment through the week ending
January 17, 1960. On January 4, 1960 the employment office referred claimant to
employment. At first claimant indicated her willingness to accept the job but
later in the day she telephoned the employment office and advised that she had
decided not to pursue the referral because of the travel time involved. A form
was prepared on January 4 by the employment office setting forth claimant’s
refusal of the employment; the form was forwarded to the local office on
January 29.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

good cause for rejecting the offer on the ground of its location. Claimant
contended further that her statement to that effect given to the employment
office on January 4 was sufficient notice to the local office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

UCV-276-57; Appeal Board, 30,538-52 and Appeal Board, 44,915-54). Consequently,
notwithstanding that claimant’s purpose in returning to Puerto Rico may have
been commendable, he was not provided with good cause to leave his job. The
initial determination of the Out-of-State Resident Office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive calendar days effective
March 31, 1960, on the ground that he voluntarily left his employment without
good cause, is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (September

11, 1960. Her work history was as follows: For about 15 years she worked as a
packer in a candy factory in Hoboken, New Jersey. Her terminal earnings were
about $80 per week, on a piecework basis. She decided to give up factory work
for reasons of health. She then worked for about five and one-half years in the
auditing department of a department store. Performing clerical work. She earned
$60 per week for a 40-hour week. Claimant is single. She lives with her married
sister. When her sister moved from New York City to Mount Vernon, claimant was
compelled to change her residence also. After commuting from Mount Vernon to
Manhattan for several months, her employer released her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was offered employment as a laborer doing assembling work in a greeting card
establishment in White Plains. The job paid $1.30 per hour, as in her last

cents per day. Claimant has been and is under medical care for conditions

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The evidence at the
Board hearing, established that claimant’s physician had advised her to avoid
factory work, because it had an adverse affect upon her health and increased
her nervousness and tension. Claimant relied upon the advice of her physician
and therefore preferred to continue office work. However, she did little to
seek such employment in Mount Vernon. She preferred not to seek employment in
other areas in Westchester because she was a stranger there. Moreover, she imposed
a restriction of a minimum of $60 per week for clerical work in Mount Vernon.
The prevailing wages for such work in Mount Vernon are substantially less than
$60 per week. Through the employment service, claimant obtained employment on
November 27, 1960 as a sales clerk in a department store in Yonkers at $1.10
per hour. However, after one days’ employment she was unable to resume work
because of illness<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In our original
decision (Appeal Board, 76,101-60), we concluded that because claimant was not
available for employment from a date prior to her refusal of the job offered to
her, she should not be charged with an additional disqualification for refusal
of employment without good cause. We therefore modified the referee’s decision
by sustaining the initial determination of unavailability and overruling the
disqualification for refusal of employment without good cause. We cited Appeal

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We believe there is
merit to the Commissioner’s contentions. In Appeal Board, 54,519-56 the
claimant was a part-time worker who, because of the need for caring for her
children, could not commence work before 9:30 a.m. She refused an offer of
employment which required her to report to the employer at 9:00 a.m. We
modified the initial determination there disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits on the ground that she had refused employment without good cause by
holding that the proper determination was that claimant was not available for
employment, effective the date of the refusal of employment. This cited case is
distinguishable from the present case as will be developed below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Appeal Board, 72,033-59
is directly in point here. There the claimant refused an offer of employment
without good cause. The local office issued two initial determinations on the
two separate grounds of unavailability and refusal of employment both effective
the date of refusal of employment. We held that claimant’s unavailability
stemmed from conditions which were&nbsp;<u>self-imposed</u>&nbsp;in connection
with her job-seeking efforts and wage demands. We concluded that under such
circumstances, the paramount issue was that of refusal of employment,
notwithstanding that the disqualification therefor was made effective
simultaneously with the ruling of unavailability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In an instance where a
claimant refuses employment for reasons which indicate unavailability for
employment, it is necessary first to examine the facts which produce the
condition of unavailability, irrespective of whether a ruling of ineligibility
is made effective the date of the refusal or prior thereto. If, as in Appeal
Board, 54,519-56, the unavailability arises because of compelling domestic or
personal circumstances then, availability is the paramount issue and the
refusal of employment provides further evidence of such unavailability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>However, a claimant who
refuses employment without good cause may not avoid the disqualification
provided for in Section 593.2 of the Law for refusal, merely because the
claimant has produced her unavailability by conditions self-imposed by her in
connection with seeking and obtaining employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Where the unavailability
is caused by compelling domestic or personal circumstances, there is a
situation over which the claimant may not have complete control. Such claimant
may be&nbsp;<u>willing</u>&nbsp;to work in the normal labor market but is
not&nbsp;<u>ready</u>&nbsp;or able to work because of such domestic or personal
circumstances. Such claimant remains unavailable until the situation which
caused her inability to work is cured. But, a claimant who renders herself
unavailable by imposing conditions or restrictions, which prevent her obtaining
employment cannot with impunity refuse an offer of employment which meets the
statutory requirements. Such claimant has control of the situation which
produces her unavailability. If it served her purpose, she could avoid work by
imposing conditions to produce her unavailability whenever suitable work was
offered and then re-establish eligibility for benefits by removing the
conditions at times when no specific offers are made. The statute permits no
such manipulation. The clear mandate of the statute is that one who refuses
employment without good cause shall be disqualified until he meets the specific
conditions of subsequent employment set forth in the Law. It is not
contemplated that one who refuses suitable employment solely because the offer
does not meet his self-imposed, unrealistic or unreasonable conditions shall be
eligible to reinstate his claim without the required subsequent employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the instant case, the
record clearly establishes that claimant was not available for employment
because of the self-imposed restrictions which we regard as unrealistic and
unreasonable. This status of unavailability continued from June 20, 1970 until
claimant removed her restrictions as to wages and location of employment as
evidenced by her acceptance of a job as a sales clerk in Yonkers at $1.10 an
hour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Now, in view of the
circumstances which produced claimant’s unavailability, it becomes necessary to
determine whether claimant refused employment without good cause. Since
claimant left factory work because it had an adverse affect upon her health,
and the proof indicates that claimant had received competent medical advice to
avoid such work, she had good cause to refuse the offered job. Moreover, the
offered work was not similar to claimant’s substantial employment of five and
one-half years as a clerical worker. Therefore, we hold that this was not a
suitable job offer in the light of claimant’s work history and because of
claimant’s physical condition. Under all of the circumstances herein, claimant
had good cause to refuse the offer of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who has neither been indicted nor convicted should not be characterized as a
&quot;felon&quot; solely on the basis of a statement signed by him in
connection with his claim for benefits, particularly since there is no
provision for, according to the claimant, the usual constitutional safeguards
against self-incrimination. To hold otherwise would imply that the Legislature
contemplated that unemployment insurance claims examiners who are authorized to
issue initial determinations, should be charged with the responsibility of
indictment. We believe that such was not the intention of the Legislature and
that it was not contemplated that those charged with the responsibility of
administering the Unemployment Insurance Law or adjudicating disputes arising
thereunder should pass judgment with respect to whether an applicant’s recital
of the circumstances surrounding the termination of his employment contains all
of the various elements necessary to sustain a charge of a felony under the
Penal Law of this State or of any other state in which the claimant may have
been employed. The difficulty of determining whether a particular statement is
sufficient to establish the commission of a felony as distinguished from
another degree of the same crime, which would be merely a misdemeanor,
emphasizes the conclusion at which we have arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguishable from each of the foregoing cases in that here, claimant could
not qualify for any partial unemployment benefits. By working for part of each
of four days in a week, claimant could not accumulate any effective days and,
therefore, her earnings from the part-time employment would not be supplemented
by any unemployment compensation. Moreover, in the absence of any partial
benefits, acceptance of the offered employment would result in the receipt by
claimant of less money than she would have received if she were totally
unemployed. In view thereof, that which we said in Appeal Board, 69,000-59 is
here applicable. In that case we held that a claimant had good cause to leave
part-time employment which, even when supplemented by partial unemployment
insurance benefits, would result in a total weekly income in an amount less

wages are so low as to make the work unsuitable for the claimant, the fact that
the rate offered may not be below the rate prevailing for similar work in the

employment practices, claimant was eligible to retire as of September 1, 1959,
as of which date, he had reached his 65<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday. Claimant
was then asked by his employer if he desired to continue to work for another
year. Claimant elected to remain in employment with the provision that he could
retire on the first day of any month during the ensuing year. On February 9,
1960, the employer requested claimant to postpone his retirement from September
1, 1960 to September 1, 1961. Claimant then elected to retire as of August 31,
1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant made this
election for a very compelling and economic reason. Prior to September 1, 1960,
the life insurance arrangements affecting the claimant were as follows. He was
covered by a $5000 policy under group insurance. Claimant paid for this
insurance at a group rate, which was $3 per month. In addition, claimant had
the protection of a $2000 life insurance policy for which the employer paid the
premium in full and without contribution from the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Effective September 1,
1960, the insurance arrangements were changed by the employer drastically. From
that date on, claimant would have lost the benefit of the $5000 policy under
the group rate but would have been permitted to convert it to an individual
premium rate at age 66. Furthermore, the $2000 life insurance protection
furnished by the employer was reduced to a $1500 death benefit. The employer’s
representative conceded that the cost of converting the $5000 policy from a
group rate to an individual rate would have been prohibitive at claimant’s age.
In summary, if claimant retired before September 1, 1960, he would have the
benefit of $7000 worth of life insurance, out of which sum he would receive the
protection of $2000 worth of insurance without payment of any premium and would
have the further protection of a $5000 policy at a very low group rate. Had he
continued to work after August 31, 1960, and then lost his employment by
discharge or otherwise, his insurance protection might have been reduced by as
much as $5500 because he would then only be entitled to the protection of the
reduced policy amount of $1500.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

circumstances, claimant decided to retire as of August 31, 1960. He thereupon
became entitled to a monthly pension of $34.69, out of which $3 was deducted
each month to pay for the group insurance on the $5000 policy. Claimant also
applied for old age benefits and is entitled to $119 per month. When
interviewed at the local office, he evidenced a willingness to forego the
social security benefits if he obtained a full-time job. After filing for
benefits, effective September 19, 1960, claimant diligently sought employment.
No issue has been raised by the local office, the employer or the Industrial
Commissioner on appeal that claimant was not available for employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

held that in view of claimant’s advanced age, the relinquishment of his rights

1960. By initial determination he was ruled ineligible for the day October 19
because of lack of total unemployment and his rights to future benefits were
reduced by 20 effective days because of wilful false statements to obtain
benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant is a member of
a labor union. In employment subject to the union agreement claimant receives
$3.50 an hour or $28 for eight hour day, and paid at time and a half rate for
overtime work. In addition thereto, the agreement provides for a shape-up and
stand-by payment in the event claimant is called for work in the morning but is
not assigned to any work. In the latter event, he receives $5.25 for standing
by. On October 19, claimant was requested to stand by. On October 21, he worked
a full day plus two and a half hours overtime. On October 26, claimant mailed a
certification for benefits for the week ending October 23, and therein stated
he had only worked on Friday, October 21, and that his earnings for that entire
week were $33. He received his wage check on October 27. His earnings for the
week ending October 23 were $46.38. Claimant did not look at the wage check and
turned it over to his wife without knowing what his earnings were for that
week. He forgot the stand by wage for October 19 when he made the certification
and that he estimated his earnings to be $33 for the one day he certified that
he had been employed in that week. When interviewed at the insurance office on
November 10, claimant again contended that he had only worked on October 21 in
the week ending October 23 and that he had earned about $33 for the day.
However, later that day after claimant had called the employer, he communicated
with the insurance examiner and conceded that he earned over $46 in that week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

benefits effective July 4, 1960 after having been separated from his employment
by the employer herein. The insurance office representatives inquired into the
facts and circumstances surrounding the termination of such employment and in
connection therewith, the employer notified the insurance office
representatives that it had discharged the claimant &quot;because of high rate
of absenteeism.&quot; The insurance office representatives were satisfied,
after investigation of facts, that claimant's absences were due to compelling
circumstances and that claimant did not deliberately provoke his discharge.
Accordingly, on August 4, 1960 an initial determination was issued holding that
the claimant was eligible to receive benefits without disqualifying conditions.
On the date of the issuance of such initial determination, a notice of the
issuance thereof was mailed to the employer herein. Endorsed on such notice to
the employer was a statement that &quot;the evidence submitted fails to show
that the claimant by any wilful act provoked his discharge.&quot; The employer
gave no indication of any disagreement with the aforesaid initial determination
within the period of 30 days from the date notice of the issuance thereof was
mailed to it. Accordingly, benefits were paid to the claimant and, upon the
issuance of benefit checks to the claimant, notices of the charges to the
employer's account were mailed to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination holding that claimant was eligible for benefits without
disqualifying conditions. It contended that claimant should have been
disqualified for having voluntarily left his employment by provoking his discharge.
It further contended that it had failed to request a referee's hearing within
30 days following the mailing of the notice of the initial determination on

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the last cited case
the Board held that an employer was not bound by the limitation set forth, in
Section 620.1(a) of the Unemployment Insurance Law and was not precluded from
contesting an initial determination of claimant's eligibility without
disqualifying conditions notwithstanding its failure to make protest until
after the issuance of a notice of experience rating charge against its account.
That decision was predicated on the theory that Section 581.1(e) of the Law
superseded the time limitation contained in Section 620.1(a) of the Law and, in
effect, extended the employer's time to protest such an initial determination.
At the time of rendition of the aforesaid decision, the Law required a deposit
by an employer who protested such an initial determination but no deposit was
required when the employer's protest related to an experience rating charge.
Significantly, the requirement for such mandatory deposits has been repealed by
the Laws of 1959, Chapter 223, effective April 1, 1959. Thus, from the
effective date of the amendment to the statute an employer need merely request
a hearing in order to obtain a review of the initial determination ruling on
the claimant's immunity from disqualification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ferraioli</u>, supra, the Court held that a referee was without jurisdiction to
inquire into the merits of a case if the protest were not made within the time
limited under the provisions of Section 620.1(a). In effect, the Court ruled
that that section of the Law provided for a &quot;statute of limitations&quot;
and that the failure to make a timely protest could not be excused. The Court
held that the initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner becomes
final if the claimant does not request a hearing within the time prescribed in
Section 620.1(a) of the Law. (also see&nbsp;<u>Matter of Adinolfi</u>, supra)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The cases reviewed by
the Court involved late protests by claimants. However, the same rule applies
with respect to employers. An employer whose account is subject to an
experience rating charge for benefits paid to a claimant is a party who is
affected by the initial determination. Section 620.1(a) specifically provides
that &quot;a claimant…or&nbsp;<u>any other party affected by such determination</u>&nbsp;may
, within 30 days after the mailing or personal delivery of notice of such
determination, request a hearing.&quot; Accordingly, if there is no protest to
an initial determination within 30 days following its issuance, it becomes
final and an employer&nbsp;<u>who is a party affected by the</u>&nbsp;initial
determination becomes bound thereby and may not attack that initial
determination when the experience rating charges which flow as a matter of
course are made against its account. A contrary ruling would enable the
employer to unduly impede or delay the administration of the Law and the
payments of benefits to unemployed workers. If an employer were permitted to
defer its protest until after its received notice of an experience rating
charge, overpayments of benefits would necessarily result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Nothing which is
contained in Section 581.1(e) of the Law requires the result sought to be
achieved by the employer herein. The notice of experience rating charge
constitutes &quot;… a determination of the priority of such charge and the
payment of benefits on which such charge is based.&quot; Under the provisions
of Section 620.2 of the Law, an employer may protest such determination, but
such protest can only bring up for review those matters which have not been
theretofore finally and conclusively established. Thus, within the statutory
period after the issuance of notice of an experience rating charge, an employer
may protest the charge against his account on the ground that his account is
not the one to be charged with the payment of such benefits, or on the ground
that during the specific period for which such benefits were paid, the claimant
was ineligible for benefits because of unavailability, incapability, lack of
total unemployment, or&nbsp;<u>for any other reasons which may have occurred
during those specific periods</u>. However the disqualification provided for in
Section 593.1 of the Law becomes effective immediately upon the filing of the
claim following the claimant's separation from his last employment and
continues indefinitely thereafter until the claimant had engaged in subsequent
employment to the extent set forth in the statute. Accordingly, it is
contemplated by the provisions of Section 620.1(a) that when an employer
receives notice of the initial determination with respect to that issue, the time
within which he may make protest thereto commences to run from the date of the
issuance of such notice. That the failure of the employer herein to make such
protest stemmed from a clerical error is or no consequence since there is no
authority for excusing its default (<u>Matter of</u>&nbsp;<u>Ferraioli, supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is pertinent to note
that the Law makes provision for a review of an initial determination in the
event the Industrial Commissioner obtains new or corrected information which
satisfies him that there was an error in the original determination. In that
event, the Commissioner is authorized to issue a new determination within one
year from the date of the issuance of the original initial determination.
However, that is not the case here. The employer did not submit to the
Industrial Commissioner any information other than that which it submitted
prior to the issuance of the original determination, and the Industrial
Commissioner has not issued any revised or superseding initial determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

filed effective July 25, 1960. By initial determination effective July 20 he
was disqualified for voluntary leaving of employment in order to follow his
spouse to another locality. Claimant resided with his wife and three children,
aged five, four and four months, in New York City. In 1959, claimant's four
year old son became seriously ill. He was hospitalized for 20 days. The
physician advised that this son be removed to a warm climate for cure. Claimant
thereupon sent the child with his wife and the other children to Puerto Rico.
He remained in New York City. After several months in Puerto Rico claimant's
wife reported that the ill son had improved. Claimant thereupon decided to make
a permanent home in Puerto Rico and quit his job in order to move there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We agree with the
referee's conclusion that the disqualification imposed by section 593.1(b) does
not apply, because claimant did not voluntarily leave his job to follow his
spouse to another locality. In Appeal Board, 79,951-61A we pointed out that, if
the proof indicates that the leaving of employment is due to compelling
circumstances which constitute good cause within the purview of Section
593.1(a) of the Law, the disqualification provided for in Section 593.1(b) does
not apply merely because, as a consequence of the leaving, the claimant joins
his spouse. Our aforesaid decision in Appeal Board, 79,951-61A is hereby
incorporated herein by reference. We find that in the instant case claimant's
voluntary separation from his employment was due to compelling circumstances in
that the well being of his child required his physical presence in Puerto Rico.
He therefore left his employment with good cause within Section 593.1(a) of the
Law and the disqualification provided for in Section 593.1(b) is inapplicable.
The initial determination of the Out-of-State Resident Office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits effective July 20, 1960, on the ground that he
voluntarily left his employment to follow his spouse to another locality is
overruled. The decision of the referee is affirmed. (May 26, 1961)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hence, there is no judicial precedent which is controlling or which is of much

Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board which has decided it both ways at different
periods of time. (Cf. Appeal Board decision 49,266-55 dated April 15, 1955;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We do not think a
claimant, under the circumstances present here, should qualify, without
restriction, for benefits. First, the general intent, purposes and objectives
of the Unemployment Insurance Law would not seem to include a situation such as
this. The primary purpose of the law is to ease the hardship of involuntary
unemployment due to economic conditions or other conditions beyond the control
of the employee. It was not intended as a substitute for a minimum wage law.
(Here claimant never received less than the legal minimum wage.) It was not
intended to regulate wages, -- it was intended as a substitute for the complete
loss of wages forced upon an employee. (Unemployment Insurance Law, § 501,
522.) secondly, the Unemployment Insurance Law expressly disqualifies claimant.
Pursuant to section 593 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, claimant is not
entitled to benefits after a voluntary separation from employment solely
because of dissatisfaction with wages, even if they were less than the
prevailing wage, unless he comes within the literal terms of an exception
contained in section 593, subdivision 1(a), the pertinent part of which reads:
&quot;* * * voluntary leaving of employment shall not in itself disqualify a
claimant if circumstances have developed in the course of such employment that
would have justified the claimant in refusing such employment in the first
instance * * *.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>No circumstances
whatever &quot;developed in the course of such employment&quot; which would
have justified claimant in refusing the employment in the first place. His
wages were not reduced during the employment, they were raised. If we assume
his wages were sub-standard when he quit, they were sub-standard when he took
the job. Nothing &quot;developed in the course of such employment&quot; which
would justify a refusal of the job in the first instance, and we may not ignore
those plain words in the statute. To hold otherwise would permit an employee,
fully aware of the wage to be paid, to take a job and use that job for the
necessary qualifying period of employment, and then, for no reason not present
in the first instance, voluntarily quit and receive unemployment insurance
benefits. Such an interpretation is unrealistic and entirely beyond the real
purpose of the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Moreover, we do not
think the record in this case sustains a finding that claimant was receiving
less than &quot;prevailing&quot; wages for his type of work. There is evidence
in the record that the wages paid claimant were commensurate with wages paid
for similar work in the locality, and that the State Employment Service had
referred applicants to job as porter at $1.00 per hour. However, the Board
relied upon a survey made by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics, dated April 1958, which found that the median salary of male
janitors, porters and cleaners in the retail trades in the New York City area
was $1.36 per hour. Claimant’s wage was within the range of wages found in the
survey (which varied widely), but was somewhat less than the &quot;median&quot;
wage. The difficulty is that &quot;median&quot; wage, the wage of the middle
worker, is not the same thing as &quot;prevailing&quot; wage. A wage may not be
said to be &quot;prevailing&quot; when substantially one-half of the workers
are receiving less and substantially one-half are receiving more. The statute
nowhere uses the word &quot;median&quot;. In order to be a prevailing wage it
must appear that at least a majority of workers in similar employment are receiving
approximately that wage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

finds no sanction in the statute, in judicial precedent, or in common sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     for the exception – circumstances which developed in the course of
     employment – is the case of a claimant who was hired many years ago with wages
     which at that time satisfied the prevailing wage requirement. However, he
     did not receive wage increases in line with the rise of the cost of living
     and the general advance of wage scales over the years. Thus, the

worked. We believe there was. Flexicore was the employer of whom the Lathers’
Union demanded employment for one of its members. The fact that the Lathers’
Union sought to achieve this objective by having its Teamster ally bring
indirect pressure through the truck drivers of an essential supplier does not
change the basic character of the controversy or alter Flexicore’s involvement.
Flexicore and the Lathers’ Union continued to be the primary disputants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The claimant contends,
however, that the conduct which caused the loss of employment was a
&quot;secondary boycott&quot; and, therefore, could not be considered an
&quot;industrial controversy&quot;. To support his position, he calls attention
to several cases holding that similar conduct has been held to be
&quot;illegal&quot; and not a &quot;labor dispute&quot; within the purview of
section 876-1 of the Civil Practice Act, our so-called anti-injunction statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

test the validity of the conduct here in issue in terms of section 876-a. The
purposes underlying the Civil Practice Act provision and those which underlie
section 592 of the Unemployment Insurance Law are entirely different. That an
employer may be entitled to injunctive relief against unlawful conduct on the
part of a union does not establish that the employees of such an employer, who
were laid off as a result of the unlawful conduct, are entitled to unemployment
insurance benefits. In interpreting section 592, the unlawfulness of the
controversy is beside the point; the statute does not permit value judgments
either as to employer or employee conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer is in contractual relations with the union of which claimant is a

employees who on June 15 of the vacation year have had five or more years of
service with the employer shall receive two weeks vacation pay and those who
have had less than five years of service shall receive one week’s vacation, to
be computed in accordance with prescribed standards, that all vacations shall
begin on Monday of the week in which July 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;falls and if two
weeks of actual vacation are taken, the same shall be two consecutive weeks of
vacation; and that any firm under contract with the union for five continuous
years or more shall close its factory for two weeks during the vacation period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a claimant receives vacation pay for the entire &quot;vacation period&quot;
there is, of course, no problem of allocation. However, where, for instance, a
&quot;vacation period&quot; of two weeks has been established and a claimant
receives payment for only one week, the payment is usually allocated to the
first week of the period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

discretion in allocation is permissible to prevent hardship. For example, the
claimant may have set aside the second week for a trip with the result that he
is not available in that week but is available in the first week. Or by
coincidence a claimant’s benefit year may expire at the end of the first week.
Allocation to the first week would deprive him of benefits in that week and
only permit credit of a waiting week in the new Benefit Year. Allocation to the
second week is proper under such circumstances as well as in other situations
where a contrary approach would be inequitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

vacation rights derive from the collective agreement. He and the employer are
equally bound by its provisions. Since the agreement specifically provides that
all vacations shall begin on the Monday in which July 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;falls,
it is clear that claimant’s vacation commenced on the first day of the plant
shut down and continued for the period for which he was paid vacation, in
accordance with Section 591.3 of the Law. It follows that the employer’s account
should not be subject to a charge for the payment of benefits arising from
claimant’s unemployment from July 4 through July 10 which might affect the
employer’s tax rate, because of the accidental circumstance that claimant’s
benefit year expired in the week in which he was ineligible for benefits
because he was in a vacation period for which no benefits are payable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

July 4 through July 10, 1960, because claimant was on a paid vacation during

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The claimants were
employed as carpenters and timberman by Tully &amp; DiNapoli, Inc., a
construction firm working on road construction projects in the New York City
area. Their duties consisted of constructing wooden forms and performing other
work in preparation for the pouring of concrete. On Monday, February 3, 1958,
Local 282 of the Teamsters Union called an industry-wide strike. Among those
who struck were the truck drivers of the Colonial Sand &amp; Gravel Company,
the outfit from which the employer obtained its concrete. As a result, since
there were no deliveries of concrete to fill the wooden forms, the claimants
were laid off on various dates over a period from Friday, January 31, the last
working preceding the strike, to February 7, some days after the strike began.
The employer’s own dump truck drivers, who carted materials from one part of
the project to another, also participated in the strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

application for full unemployment insurance benefits was rejected by the
Industrial Commissioner and by the Referee. However, both the Appeal Board and
a unanimous Appellate Division took a different view; it was their opinion that
the employer’s decision to curtail operations and the claimant’s loss of
employment occurred because of a combination of unfavorable weather and the
strike of the Colonial Sand and Gravel truck drivers. It is clear that the
claimant’s loss of employment was not attributable to the participation of the
employer’s dump truck drivers in the Teamster strike. It is enough to say that,
for the reasons set out in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Ferrara</u>&nbsp;(supra, p. ), we
conclude in this case, too, that the industrial controversy which gave rise to
the layoff did not occur in the establishment in which the claimants were

contract between the employer and the union expired on September 30, 1960. On
October 1 a strike was called against the employer by the union involved. Prior
to the beginning of the industrial controversy the employer, through the medium
of a weekly newspaper published for its employees and through local newspapers,
had notified its employees that there was a threat of a strike but that the
employer’s plants would remain open for all employees who wished to work; that
the employer had been assured by law enforcement officials that individuals who
wished to work would be protected against any illegal acts such as violence,
threats or intimidation. Among other statements the publication set forth acts
that had been held illegal by the National Labor Relations Board and by the
courts, such as participating in mass picketing at gates, designed to prevent
access to employees desiring to work; physically damaging or manhandling any
vehicle seeking entrance to the plant; standing or massing in front of, or placing
any kind of obstruction in the path of, such vehicle in an attempt to prevent
access to the plant; physically assaulting employees who attempted to enter the

following additional findings of fact: The employer’s plant is located on about
300 acres of land in the outskirts of Syracuse. There are about 14,000
employees of which about 9,000 are salaried workers who were not affected by
the strike. There are about 5200 production and maintenance workers. Their
starting hour of work is 7 a.m. Of this group, about 1200 reported for work
during the strike. In the course of the strike, five entrances to the plant
premises were in use. Incidents occurred at or near several of the plant
entrances which resulted in disciplinary action taken by the employer against
thirty-three individual employees. Of these 15 were discharged and 18 were
suspended for varying periods. The twenty-one claimants involved on this appeal
are among these and are grouped as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this group wilfully parked his or her automobile in concert with others at or
near entrances to the employer’s plant, resulting in a complete blocking of the
plant entrances for periods of as long as 15 minutes, preventing employees who
desired to enter the plant from so doing. All of this group, except claimants
A.A. and R.T. participated in the blocking of the main entrance to the
employer’s plant commencing at about 6:20 a.m. on October 10 by placing their
personal automobiles in the roadway. The employer used various means of
removing the vehicles from the road. As soon as one car was removed, another
automobile would be driven into its place to complete the blockage. Traffic on
the main highway leading to the main entrance was disrupted and backed up for a
considerable distance. Employees wishing to enter the company premises through
the main entrance were unable to do so. Claimants A.A. and R.T. in concert with
others similarly blocked different entrance roads into the employer’s plant in
the early morning hours of October 10, thus preventing employees’ cars from
entering the plant premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employees desiring to enter the plant for that purpose. On September 29 and
prior to the strike, claimant as president of the union local addressed the
union members at a meeting held at the plant gate, telling the workers that the
success of the strike is dependent upon the picketing and making suggestions to
the workers as to the manner of conducting themselves as pickets. On October 5
at about 6:45 a.m., claimant appeared in front of the main gate to the
employer’s plant and outside of the employer’s premises where there were at the
time from 60 to 70 pickets and 25 to 30 law enforcement officials. L.V.,
following advice of union counsel, instructed the pickets as to the manner in
which they may line up and picket in front of the entrance. By 7 a.m. the
picket line had increased to from 100 to 125 pickets. The picket line was
broken from time to time to permit traffic to enter the gate. Claimant indulged
in discussions and arguments with officials as to what constituted legal
picketing, as to which there was a difference of opinion. At one point,
claimant in crossing the road caused an automobile entering the plant to stop
momentarily in the roadway while he moved out of the way in order to avoid

claimants in Group II, we agree with the conclusion reached by the referee with
the exception of his disposition of the case of claimant M.M. (Appeal Board,
80,112-61). This claimant was charged with a serious offense resulting in
personal injuries to a fellow employee. Although there is no question that such
an assault took place, there is considerable doubt whether claimant was the
person who committed the assault. It is not disputed that because of the
darkness which prevailed at the time identification of the guilty person is a
difficult matter. Significantly, claimant has been placed at another location
at the time of the assault by witnesses including those of the employer.
Moreover, the victim, when originally reporting for treatment for her injuries,
did not name claimant as her assailant. Upon all of the evidence, we are of the
opinion that it was not established that claimant M.M. was guilty of the acts
of misconduct charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimants M.E.C., H.B.,
H.T., S.B. and R.N. in Group II were shown to have committed acts causing
damage to employees’ automobiles which were being driven through entrances to
the plant by employees on their way to work. Unquestionably, such acts passed
beyond the bounds of peaceful picketing and were intended to intimidate and
discourage workers from continuing their employment during the strike.
Claimants R.B. and R.N. in this group, in concert with others, blocked the entrance
to the employer’s plant and failed to heed the warnings of the law enforcement
officers to disperse. As the referee observed, while these two employees were
the only ones of this group charged with the offense, their actions were
sufficiently identified with violence or threat of violence to warrant a
finding that their subsequent loss of employment was occasioned by acts of
misconduct. It is, therefore, immaterial to the case that the other
participants were not similarly charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Finally, we agree with
the referee in his disposition with respect to L.V., the only claimant in Group
III, as to whom an appeal was taken. The charge against this claimant relating
to the speech made by him prior to the strike is that, at the most, he made
misleading statements to accompanying employees concerning their constitutional
rights. The other charge arising out of claimant’s participation in the
incident at the main gate on the morning of October 5 was not sustained by the
evidence. Claimant was at the scene in his capacity as president of the local
instructing and advising the pickets as to their rights as he understood them.
It is understandable that in the heat of argument and the confusion arising out
of an incident such as this, legal niceties cannot be observed with exactitude.
Upon all of the evidence, it cannot be said that it was shown that claimant
L.V.’s actions were deliberately designed to create an atmosphere of fear and
terror as charged by the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

comment. The alternative determinations of voluntary leaving of employment
without good cause by provoking their discharge issued against claimants are
based on the employer’s statements and publications warning employees against
the commission of illegal acts in the course of the strike and the declaration
by the employer that any such illegal act would be considered as cause for
disciplinary action. It is unnecessary to pass upon this question except with respect
to claimants M.M. and L.V. as to both claimants, we hold that it has not been
shown that they deliberately acted in such a manner as to provoke their

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Board
which held that since claimant’s claim for benefits was not sustainable, when
filed, because her unwillingness to work more than three days per week made it
impossible for her to accumulate any effective days of unemployment (Labor Law,
§§ 523; 527, subd. 3), she could not be disqualified, under subdivision 2 of
section 593 of the Labor Law, upon her subsequent refusal of employment without
good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The board’s decision is
predicated in large part upon its quotation of the language that, &quot;before
a disqualification may be imposed, benefit rights must exist from which
[claimant] might be disqualified&quot;, from our opinion in&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Foscarinis</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>) (284 app. Div. 476, 478) in which, however,
the refusal of the offer of employment occurred&nbsp;<u>before&nbsp;</u>any
claim for unemployment benefits was made. The board would thus limit the
meaning of &quot;claimant&quot; as used in the statute (Labor Law, § 593, subd.
2) to one who has filed a &quot;valid original claim&quot; (this quotation in
the board’s decision being from section 527 of the statute); but
&quot;claimant&quot; is expressly defined by section 515 as meaning &quot;any
person seeking benefits for unemployment.&quot; Thus, the meaning suggested by
the board is not merely at odds with the statutory definition but would ignore,
also, the common acceptation of the term as referring to one&nbsp;<u>claiming</u>&nbsp;benefits
to which he may or may not be entitled and thus by strained construction of
unambiguous language attach a peculiar significance to a simple term. Indeed,
in the&nbsp;<u>Foscarinis</u>&nbsp;case (<u>supra</u>), upon which the board’s
decision rests, we held the language of the statute &quot;clear and
unambiguous&quot; (p. 477) and in the very first sentence of the opinion
defined the question presented as &quot;whether a refusal of an offer of
employment by a person&nbsp;<u>not then claiming benefits</u>, may be the basis
of disqualification under section 593 (subd. 2) ***when he&nbsp;<u>thereafter</u>&nbsp;applies
for benefits&quot; (p. 476). (Emphasis supplied.) Here, respondent had filed,
thus becoming a &quot;claimant,&quot; prior to the making and refusal of a job
offer. The decision necessarily implies that respondent had never been a
claimant and does not proceed upon the ground that she had ceased to be such by
reason of the original denial of benefits; but, on the contrary, seems to
recognize that her status, however defined, continued unchanged. Indeed, it was
while she, as a claimant, was continuing to report (pursuant to the
Commissioner’s direction, during the period within which application for review
could be made) and while she thus remained &quot;within the system&quot; (<u>Foscarinis</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>,
p. 478), that the unemployment insurance office notified her of the offer of
re-employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The conclusion which we
have reached finds support in our decision in the somewhat analogous case
of&nbsp;<u>Matter of King</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>) (278 App. Div. 1036). There,
as appears from the record on appeal, the board held that the statutory
forfeiture by reason of a willful false statement (Labor Law, §594) was
improperly imposed by the initial determination because claimant was then
ineligible for benefits because of insufficient earnings in his base year and
hence had no benefit rights which could be suspended then or in a new benefit
year. This court reversed and reinstated the initial determination, as one that
&quot;the statute expressly permits&quot;. If the limitation &quot;valid
original claim&quot; did not, in&nbsp;<u>King</u>, qualify the reference to
&quot;claimant&quot; in section 594, certainly it may not be read into
subdivision 2 of section 593. In any event, the construction foung by the Board
in the case before us seems forced and both unwarranted and unnecessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to its support. Claimant was last employed as a stock clerk in a department
store for a period of five months until October 1960, at a salary of $58 for a
five-day, 40-hour week. Prior to this employment, he had worked for a jewelry
supply firm, also as a stock clerk, for five months until April 1960, at a salary

employment office received a job order from the jewelry supply firm requesting
that the claimant be referred to it for re-employment. Claimant reported to the
employer and was offered re-employment, but only on a part-time basis for four
hours a day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., five days a week at the rate of $1.50 an
hour, totaling $30 a week. Although claimant initially accepted the employment
to commence on October 31, he subsequently refused the offer. Prior to the date
on which he was due to commence work, he informed the employer that he would
not accept part-time work but would be willing to work full-time. Aside from
his objection to the reduced earnings entailed in the part-time job, claimant
objected that if he had accepted such employment from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., it
would not have permitted him to seek employment at a time when most jobs are
obtainable. Claimant’s benefit rate is $28 a week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the employment offer to claimant was for five days a week, and would not permit
her to supplement the lower wage received from such part-time work with partial
unemployment insurance benefits. Considering the expenses to be incurred by
claimant and the deductions from her wages, acceptance of this employment would

apply the rule enunciated by the majority would necessarily provide the

the worker with dependents would not have that protection because his gross pay
would exceed his benefit rate since the amount of deductions, which is made
from a worker’s gross pay, depends upon the number of his dependents in
computing the tax deductions and hospitalization insurance premiums. An
unmarried claimant with no dependents, because of such deductions, would have a
lower net pay than would be the case of a married worker with dependents
earning the same gross pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

less than his benefit rate should not be disqualified for leaving his
employment. I am in full agreement with this principle. However, I do not
believe that we should go beyond that. In the case before us, claimant’s weekly
earnings would exceed his benefit rate by $2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pay to the benefit rate. There, the benefit rate was $35, the gross earnings in
part-time employment $38, and the net or take home pay, somewhat less than the
benefit rate. However, upon careful reconsideration I believe the &quot;net
pay&quot; concept is erroneous. The only sound test to apply is a comparison of
the gross pay offered to the benefit rate. In the absence of undue hardship or
other factors, if the gross pay for the offered part-time employment is equal
to, or exceeds the benefit rate, then the wage offered is not inadequate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

months until July 1960. Except for this period of employment, claimant has been
self-employed during the past six years as a mason contractor. He owns and uses
in his business, equipment worth approximately $4,000. From July 1960, when his
employment was terminated, until December 15, 1960, claimant was actively
engaged in his own business. On the latter date, he was compelled to cease

with the referee that claimant was totally unemployed because he performed no
services in connection with his own business during the period for which he
claimed benefits. The record establishes that claimant had been self-employed
for many years and that he had been engaged in his own business for several
months before the cold weather compelled him to cease operations. Claimant was
prepared to resume his business operation if he could obtain contracts for work
that could be done inside. He sought such work but did not obtain any. Since
claimant continued at all times during the period in issue to promote the
interest of his own business, he was not totally unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

written statement accompanying the foregoing Federal wage survey, among others,
the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics has advised
that data was obtained by personal visits of Bureau field economists to representative
establishments within six broad industry divisions, that the occupations
selected for study are common to a variety of manufacturing and
non-manufacturing industries and that each occupational classification is based
on a uniform set of job descriptions which is designed to take account of
inter-establishment variations in duties within the same job. The job
description of a guard contained in the appendix to the foregoing Federal wage
survey, among others, is a person who &quot;performs routine duties, either at
fixed post or on tour, maintaining order, using arms or force where necessary.
Includes gatemen who are stationed at gate and check on identity of employees
and other persons entering, &quot;and the job description of a watchman set
forth in the aforementioned appendix is a person who &quot;makes rounds of
premises periodically in protecting property against fire, theft, and illegal
entry.&quot; According to a Federal wage survey dated April 1960, the average
straight-time hourly earnings of 2459 watchmen employed in the locality were
$1.83 during the period involved (Bulletin No. 1265, page 15, United States
Department of Labor, Bureau of Research Statistics). The foregoing wage survey
showed that 1319 watchmen earned at least $1.80 an hour and the vast majority earned
a greater hourly sum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and testimony in the record including the foregoing wage surveys conducted by

facts found as herein above set forth, we conclude that $1.80 an hour

that guards or watchmen employed by detective and guard service agencies in the
locality should be treated separate and apart from guards or watchmen employed
in all other industries, at least for the purpose of determining prevailing
wages. For a number of reasons, we overruled such contention raised by the same
employer in Appeal Board, UCX-16-61 which is incorporated herein by reference
as though fully set forth. Moreover, the precise question was considered by the
Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Shotkin</u>, 10 App. Div. 2d 738, reversing Appeal
Board, 63,045-58, where it was stated that &quot;certainly in a case such as
this, involving work of a nature utilized in all industries, the determination
of prevailing rate under subdivision (d) is not to be reached upon the
application of so narrow a test as that afforded by a particular industry;
absent proof of some unusual or exceptional factor or condition.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The record contains no
cogent and convincing proof of any unusual or exceptional factor or condition
which would warrant a deviation from the principle enunciated in&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Shotkin</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>. The business of the employer is analogous to
that of agencies engaged in furnishing temporary or permanent office workers,
such as clerks, typists, stenographers, secretaries, bookkeepers and
receptionists. In no case has it been suggested to us that such agencies
compose a separate and distinct industry which is privileged to fix a so-called
prevailing wage based solely upon salaries paid by them to office workers and
without taking into consideration the actual prevailing wages for all such
workers in the locality. To accept the employer’s concept that there is, or
should be, a prevailing wage applicable solely to guards or watchmen employed
in detective and guard service agencies, as distinguished from guards or
watchmen employed in all other industries, would inevitably result in
depressing wages of workers in the former category. Such a result would violate
the clear purpose and intent of Section 593.2(d) of the Law and would also be
contrary to the rule established in the&nbsp;<u>Shotkin</u>&nbsp;case,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Inasmuch as the
claimants were offered re-employment with their former employer at wages which
were approximately 30 percent below those prevailing for similar work in the
locality, we hold that the offered wages are substantially less favorable to
the claimants than those prevailing for similar work in the locality (Appeal
Board, 74,299-60; 71,720-59; 59,573-57; 59,248-57; 57,381-56). That claimant
W.H.S. obtained employment in the locality as a guard with an international
organization at an hourly wage of $2 (almost double the wage offered to
claimant by his former employer) is a further indication of the disparity of
the offered wages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with the contention of the employer that claimants (except W.H.S., T.R.G. and
A.A.R. who were not last employed by the employer) voluntarily left their
employment without good cause, irrespective of whether their wages were
substantially below those prevailing for similar work in the locality. The
following reasoning of the Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Sellers</u>, 13 App. Div.
2d 204, reversing Appeal Board, 70,414-59 applies:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

is not entitled to benefits after a voluntary separation from employment solely
because of dissatisfaction with wages, even if they were less than the
prevailing wage, unless he comes within the literal terms of an exception
contained in Section 593, subdivision 1(a) …No circumstances whatever
&quot;developed in the course of such employment&quot; which would have
justified claimant in refusing the employment in the first place. His wages
were not reduced during the employment, they were raised. If we assume his
wages were sub-standard when he quit, they were sub-standard when he took the
job. Nothing &quot;developed in the course of such employment&quot; which would
justify a refusal of the job in the first instance, and we may not ignore those
plain words in the statute. To hold otherwise would permit an employee, fully
aware of the wage to be paid, to take a job and use that job for the necessary
qualifying period of employment, and then, for no reason not present in the
first instance, voluntarily quit and receive unemployment insurance benefits.
Such an interpretation is unrealistic and entirely beyond the real purpose of
the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

however, with the contention of the employer that those claimants who refused
the offers of re-employment lacked good cause, irrespective of whether the
offered wages were substantially below those prevailing for similar work in the
locality. The employer argues that the provisions of Section 593.2(d) of the
Unemployment Insurance Law do not apply to a base period employer but only to
all other employers. Such an interpretation appears to be wholly unwarranted
and contrary to the plain language and clear intent of the statute, which makes
no differentiation whatsoever between a base period employer and other

employer’s contract with the Production Workers’ Union expired on December 31,
1960. Negotiations were being held to attempt to agree upon a new contract. No
such agreement was reached by December 31, 1960, and at the request of the
employer, the union extended the contract for two weeks until January 15, 1961,
while negotiations continued. By January 10, the employer and the union were
still unable to agree upon the terms of a new contract. The union scheduled a
meeting of its members for January 15, to take a strike vote. On January 10,
the employer was contemplating ordering additional raw materials to continue
steady production beyond January 15. However, before doing so, it asked the
union for an assurance that there would be a further extension of the contract
beyond January 15, if their points of difference were not reconciled by that
time. The union refused to give any such assurance to the employer. The process
for the manufacture of the employer’s foam rubber products requires three days to
complete. Once the process is commenced, if an interruption should occur, the
materials being processed would be ruined. To avoid the risk of spoilage of
materials if a strike were to occur on January 15, and because the union had
refused to assure the employer of continued operations beyond the work-week
ending Friday, January 13, the employer refrained from ordering new raw
materials for manufacturing operations and decided to merely continue
production until its supply of raw materials on hand was exhausted. The
employer could have obtained a delivery of additional raw materials on hand was
exhausted. The employer could have obtained a delivery of additional raw
material overnight if it were assured that a strike would not be voted on
January 15, to prevent continued operations. On Thursday, January 12, the
supply of raw material on hand was finished, and further production operations
necessarily ceased. Accordingly, approximately 22 of the 29 production workers,
including claimant C. were laid off on that day. The remaining seven production
workers were permitted to come in on January 13 to clean up, and they were laid
off at the end of that day. On Sunday, January 15, a strike of the production
workers occurred and a picket line set up. The controversy ended on March 17,
1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

maintenance workers and their union were not involved in the controversy. They
did not strike. On the contrary, they crossed the picket line of the production
workers and continued to work through January 20, when they were laid off by
the employer because its fuel oil supply was exhausted and the premises were
without heat. The maintenance workers were willing to continue working beyond
January 20, even though the premises were unheated, but the employer would not
agree to this because the weather was intensely cold and it feared that the
sprinkler system might freeze and be damaged. Accordingly, the employer laid
off all the maintenance workers on January 20, after having the sprinkler
system emptied and disconnected to prevent freezing. The employer admitted that
despite the strike of the production workers there was plenty of work for the
maintenance men beyond January 20, and that were it not for the lack of heat in
the premises, it would have kept the maintenance men working beyond that date.
The employer normally obtained its fuel oil from an outside oil company wholly
removed from the employer’s premises. The fuel oil was normally used to produce
heat necessary in the manufacturing operation, in addition to supplying heat for
the building. Because of the production workers’ picket line, the employer was
unable to obtain fuel oil from its usual supplier to heat its building after
the production workers’ strike began on January 15.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the employer allowed his supply of raw materials to become depleted and it
did not order new supplies solely because of its apprehension and anticipation
of a strike by the production workers. Its fears of a strike scheduled for
January 15 were confirmed on January 10, when the production workers’ union
refused to grant the employer an extension of negotiations beyond January 15.
At that time, negotiations between the employer and the union representing the
production workers were stalemated. It is immaterial that economic reasons may,
in part, have motivated the employer’s actions. The basic reason for the loss
of employment by the production workers cannot be ascribed to a lack of work in
the usual economic sense, but was due to an actual and real existence of an
industrial controversy leading to suspension of operations by the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguishable from this case. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Keane</u>, the employer
laid off some workers (not its entire force) because of a shortage of work
caused by the fact that the employer did not accept new work from its customers
in apprehension that pending negotiations with the union involved might result
in a strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>However, despite the
employer’s fears, no strike ever eventuated. In fact, work at the employer’s
establishment and negotiations with the union proceeded during the entire
period in question peacefully and without appreciable incident until a
successful conclusion. The Courts sustained the Board’s finding that no strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy ever existed. In this case, the threat of
a strike was not only real, but immediately ripened into an industrial
controversy attended by picketing. The timetable of events is significant to
support this conclusion. The contract with the production workers’ union
expired December 31, 1960. Negotiations prior thereto for a new contract failed
to achieve that result. By mutual consent, the contract was extended to January
15, 1961, while negotiations continued. On January 10, the employer asked the
union for assurance of a further extension of the contract beyond January 15,
so that it could order additional raw materials to continue steady production
beyond January 15. The union refused to given such assurance. Since it took a
minimum of three days to process the employer’s products, and since materials
in process would be ruined if a strike were to occur on January 15, and since
the union refused to assure the employer of continued operations beyond the
week ending&nbsp;<u>Friday</u>, January 13, the employer refrained from
ordering new raw materials and decided to continue production only until its
supply of raw materials was exhausted. On&nbsp;<u>Thursday</u>, January 12, the
supply of raw materials was exhausted and production ceased, whereupon 22 of
the 29 production workers were laid off. The remaining seven production workers
worked on&nbsp;<u>Friday</u>, January 13 to clean up and when this assignment
was completed, they were laid off at the end of that day. The strike commenced
and a picket line was set up on&nbsp;<u>Sunday</u>, January 15.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Unlike the situation
in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Keane</u>, there was not merely the threat of a strike but
the layoffs were the direct result of the union’s refusal to continue the
extension of a contract and its refusal to assure the employer of continued
operations beyond January 13 which would have permitted the continued
processing of the employer’s materials. These refusals on the part of the union
was part of its plan of economic pressure to compel the employer to renew the
contract between them and were in keeping with its intention to strike on
January 15, when the extension of the contract expired. These refusals on the
part of the union were just as much a part of the industrial controversy
between it and the employer as was the picket line, which was, set up
immediately before a new workweek could commence. It is therefore clear that
the production workers lost their employment directly because of an industrial
controversy in the establishment in which they were employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We are also not
unmindful of our decision in Appeal Board, 65,403 where the facts also were markedly
different. In that case, the employer, a dress contractor, was not furnished
with work by its jobber because the jobber feared the outbreak of a strike in
the industry. Accordingly, as each claimant completed the work on hand, he was
laid off by his employer. When the industry wide strike took place later, the
claimants therein had already been laid off because of lack of work. Relying
upon the Court’s decision in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Keane</u>, we held that
claimants’ unemployment resulted from a lack of work, a condition which
resulted from the fact that the claimants’ employer was not furnished with work
from an outside source. Unlike the situation in this case, the union involved
was not asked to permit its members to continue operations while the
negotiations for a new contract were continued. The lack of work in the dress
industry was occasioned solely by the exercise of the prerogative of the jobber
not to supply materials to the contractor so that financial loss would be
minimized when and if a strike eventuated. In this case, when the strike
commenced on January 15, 1961, the production workers had been laid off solely
because the union exercised its prerogative to refuse to allow the workers to
continue on the job while negotiations continued and to refuse to extend the
contract. These refusals were a manifestation of the industrial controversy
precipitated by the production workers’ union, and we must hold that the loss
of employment by the production workers was due to such industrial controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employed as carpenters and timbermen by a construction firm. An industry-wide
strike was called by a teamsters’ union. As a result, the truck drives of the
concern from which the employer obtained its concrete and the drivers of some
of the employer’s dump trucks went on strike. Since there were no deliveries of
concrete necessary for such claimants to continue work, they were accordingly
laid off. The evidence therein also indicated that unfavorable weather
conditions were a factor in the employer’s decision to curtail its operations.
The Court held that such claimants’ loss of employment occurred because of a
combination of unfavorable weather conditions and the strike, not by its
employees, but by the employees of the employer’s suppliers. The rationale of
that decision was that the provisions of Section 592.1 are not applicable where
the claimants’ loss of employment was not attributable to the participation of
the employer's’ truck drivers in the teamster strike and that the industrial
controversy which gave rise to the layoff did not occur in the establishment in

employed elsewhere is of no importance. We must deal with the circumstances
existing at the particular time when the unemployment arose. At that time they
were clearly employed in the &quot;establishment&quot; where the industrial
controversy arose. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to a holding that
employees regularly working at the same plant but in a different department, or
doing a different kind of work, or belonging to a different union than striking

that fact that as a result of the strike by the production workers and the
establishment of picket lines by them, the employer could not obtain the
materials requisite for it to continue the operation of its plant and office.
The fact that the employer could not obtain deliveries of fuel oil to heat its
premises and consequently could not continue its operations were the direct
consequence of the industrial controversy initiated and continued by the
production workers. The work which the maintenance workers and the payroll
clerk performed was as essential to the manufacture of the employer’s product as
was the work of the production workers. The closing of the plant stemmed
directly from the effective economic weapon of the striking workers directed
against the employer. To ignore the direct link in the chain of causation

1959, by a company which operated a cigar and novelties store as a watchman and
general helper. He was a part-time worker, working at least four hours a day at
a salary of $20 per week. During the month of December 1960 claimant was
informed by a customer that he was receiving less wages than the New York State
Minimum Wage Law permitted. On January 3, 1961 claimant filed a claim with the
Department of Labor for back salary pursuant to the terms of the Minimum Wage
Law and an investigation was made of the employer’s books and records. Claimant
thereafter instituted a civil action against the employer to recover the sum of
$2,600 allegedly due him as the difference between the weekly pay he received
and the legal minimum wage to which he was entitled. This action was thereafter
compromised and settled for the sum of $450 which the employer paid him. The
employer conceded that the salary paid to claimant was less than the Minimum
Wage prescribed by Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Department of Labor certifying that he had worked only three and one-half hours
a day. In response to an inquiry from the insurance office, the employer
reported that it did not discharge claimant, but that he left of his own accord

Unemployment Insurance Law, and a referee is without jurisdiction to adjudicate
any matter not specifically authorized by the provisions of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. As a claimant for benefits, claimants’ right to a referee
hearing is governed solely by the provisions of Section 620.1 of the Law. It is
there provided that a hearing may be requested only by a claimant &quot;who is
dissatisfied with an initial determination of the claim for benefits. In the
instant case, since the initial determination with respect to the claims for
benefits were not adverse to any of the claimants, none of them has a basis for
dissatisfaction therewith, and consequently, they have no right to request a
hearing with respect to such initial determinations. The denial by the
Commissioner of the requests of the claimants for the disclosure of information
does not constitute an initial determination of the claim for benefits. An
initial determination is defined in Section 597 of the Law. The ruling of the
Industrial Commissioner denying claimants’ request does not relate to the
validity of the claims nor to the amount of benefits payable to the claimants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

argument advanced on claimants behalf that they claim to be aggrieved by the
Commissioner’s failure to permit them to inspect the information furnished by
the employer in that they are deprived of the opportunity of learning what
reasons were advanced by the employer for the termination of claimants’
employment with the result that they are unable to use that information in any
proceedings in which they may become involved for the purpose of attempting to
establish that the claimants were wrongfully discharged by the employer. In
that regard it is appropriate to point out that under the provisions of Section
537 of the Law, information acquired from employers pursuant to the provisions
of the Unemployment Insurance Law, shall be for the exclusive use and
information of the Commissioner in the discharge of his duties under&nbsp;<u>that
Law</u>&nbsp;and shall not be used in any Court, in any action or proceeding

on behalf of the claimants that they are entitled to the information which they
seek under the authority of that portion of Section 537 of the Law which
permits such information to be made available to parties affected in connection
with effecting placement. It is the contention of the claimants that the
information sought is necessary to assist them in obtaining other employment.
There is no merit to the contentions so advanced since there is a total lack of
proof purporting to establish that such information would in any wise affect
the procurement of other work by claimants and for the further reason, that the
Law specifically vests in the Industrial Commissioner the discretion of
determining whether the information should be made available for such purpose.
It does not appear that the exercise of such discretion by the Industrial
Commissioner in the instant case was arbitrary or capricious. Under the
circumstances, we conclude that claimants had no legal right to a hearing with
regard to their protest of the Commissioner’s denial of their request, and that
the referee was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute with respect to
such disposition by the Commissioner of the claimants’ request. The decision of
the referee is affirmed. (November 16, 1961)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last employed from April 27, 1955 until June 16, 1961 by a shipping firm.
Thereafter she went on her vacation and was due to return to work on July 3,
1961. While on such vacation, she married a widower with a 16-month-old son.
Upon the marriage, the husband discharged his housekeeper who took care of his
infant. Claimant then replaced the said housekeeper in the care of the child.
Because of her marriage and her assumption of responsibility for the care of
her husband’s child, claimant did not return to her employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the union, which is in contractual relationship with the employer. Under the
union contract claimant was entitled to certain &quot;bumping&quot; privileges.
Thus, as a result of a curtailment in production, claimant was temporarily
transferred to the classification of yard laborer at $2.25 per hour. Claimant
worked as a yard laborer from January 10 to March 27, 1961. About this time, he
notified the employer that he was physically unable to perform the work of yard
laborer. Claimant was examined by the plant physician and was certified to be
capable of performing the duties of yard laborer. Despite this finding,
claimant did not report for work from March 27 until April 4, 1961. During this
week, the employer communicated with the claimant and advised him that unless
he reported for work or presented medical evidence as to his incapability, he
would be discharged. Claimant reported for work on April 4 worked for one hour
and then left. He did not present a medical certificate from his physician. He
had not been under the care of his physician until April 7. Claimant presented
a certificate from his physician dated May 2, 1961 indicating that claimant was
under this care from April 7 to May 2 and that in his opinion claimant should
not work as a laborer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which would have justified the claimant in refusing such employment in the

the claimant to comply with the employer’s request by furnishing contrary
information, if any, from his own physician. Claimant did not comply with the
request because he did not visit his physician until several days subsequent to
his discharge. His failure to visit his doctor supports the opinion of the
plant physician that claimant was in sufficiently good health so as not to

salary offered was thirteen percent less than the prevailing wage. We therefore
hold that the wage offered was substantially less favorable to this claimant
than that prevailing for similar work in the locality. It is significant that
the survey establishes that 65 percent of all the workers engaged in the work
offered to claimant earn a wage which is substantially more than that which was
offered to claimant, and further, that more than two-thirds of the total 10,314
workers who compose the middle fifty percent earn a wage which is more than ten
percent higher than the offered wage. In our view, such differential is
substantial and justifies our conclusion that the offered wage is substantially
less favorable to claimant than the prevailing wage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from a job at which she had been paid $95 per week. After she had filed her
claim for unemployment insurance benefits the State Employment Service got for
her a job referral or offer of employment at $90 per week which she refused on
the ground that the wage was inadequate. The Industrial Commissioner,
thereafter ruled that she was not entitled to insurance benefits since, as he
thought, she had not brought herself within the exception found in Labor Law,
Section 593.2, subdivision d, which provides that such a claimant need not
accept employment where: &quot;the wages or compensation . . . are
substantially less favorable to the claimant than those prevailing for similar
work in the locality.&quot; The referee and in turn the Appeal Board overruled
the Commissioner. When the matter came to the courts on the Commissioner's
appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed. The court called attention to Section
624 of the Labor Law which limits the court's power of review to questions of
law only and held that there was no power in the courts to upset factual determinations
of the Appeal Board and that this particular determination was not erroneous in
its construction or application of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Some preliminary
observations are in order. First, the question as to what is the
&quot;prevailing wage&quot; for a kind of work in a locality is essentially one
of fact. Second, if claimant falls within the exception she is entitled to
reject the offer and collect her insurance benefits, whether or not an
administrative official or agency or court thinks she should have taken the offered
job. Third, since the statutory test is as to whether the job offer was at a
wage &quot;substantially less favorable to claimant&quot; than the
&quot;prevailing&quot; wage for such work in the area, the fact that the wage
for the rejected employment was nearly as high as claimant had previously been
earning is not only not determinative but is of little or no legal
significance. Fourth, the Appeal Board is the highest administrative body in
the unemployment insurance claim adjudication hierarchy and so its
determination and its construction and application of the terms
&quot;prevailing wage&quot; and &quot;substantially less favorable&quot; must
be accepted by the courts &quot;if it has warrant in the record and a
reasonable basis in law&quot; - in other words, if it has a &quot;rational
basis&quot; (<u>Matter of Mounting &amp; Finishing Co. v. McGoldrick</u>, 294

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It would be impossible
on this record for a court to hold as matter of law that the $90 weekly wage
turned down by claimant was not substantially less favorable than the
prevailing wage for such work in the locality. The underlying statistics were
assembled by the Department's Bureau of Research and show that the range of
wages paid to about 20,000 people engaged in this work (a concededly fair
sampling) was from $40 to $145 per week but that about half of them were
working at wages ranging from $90 to $120 weekly. The Commissioner struck from
the sample the lowest and the highest quartiles as representing extreme lows
and highs and then computed at $103.63 the weighted average of the middle 50
per cent. So far, his method and his mathematics were unexceptionable. But his
task under the statute was to find what was &quot;substantially less
favorable&quot; than the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; and this he did by holding
in effect that the &quot;prevailing wage cut-off&quot; was $90 per week. In
other words, he decided that any wage inside the middle 50 per cent (including
the $90 at the bottom thereof) was not &quot;substantially less favorable&quot;
than the &quot;prevailing wage.&quot; The Appeal Board, however, pointed out
that the same survey showed that 65 per cent of all the people engaged in this
work in the area earned more than $90 (5,000 receive less than $90, 2,000 get
$90 and 13,000 are paid more than $90 and up to $140) and that of the middle 50
per cent more than two-thirds receiving wages more than 10 per cent higher than
the $90 offered to claimant. Therefore, held the Appeal Board, the $90 figure
was &quot;substantially less favorable&quot; to claimant than the
&quot;prevailing&quot; wage and claimant was within her rights in refusing it.
The Appeal Board adopted no &quot;rule&quot; that a wage cannot be more than 10
per cent below the weighted average of the middle half, but held that the
claimant could reject the job offer since its compensation was not within 10
per cent of $103.63.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Surely there was a
&quot;rational basis&quot; for the Board's conclusion that the offer was
substantially lower than the prevailing wage for such jobs in the locality,

much more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Commissioner,
however, stands firm on his own directive issued in January 1962 after the
court's decision in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Sellers</u>&nbsp;(13 A.D. 2d 204).
In&nbsp;<u>Sellers</u>&nbsp;it had been ruled that it was arbitrary and
improper to take the median or middle wage in a sample as the &quot;prevailing
wage.&quot; In the directive the Commissioner notified his staff that in cases
where there is no concentration of 40 per cent or more workers at the same wage
rage, the weighted average of the middle 50 per cent was thereafter to be used
(instead of the &quot;median&quot; wage or wage of the middle worker&quot; as
the prevailing wage. As to &quot;substantially less favorable&quot; his order
to his staff was that such a label was to be applied to any wage less than the
lowest wage of the middle 50 per cent or more than 20 per cent below the prevailing
rate. Applying those rules to the present case would require claimant to accept
any job offered at $90 (lowest wage of middle 50 per cent). The Commissioner
argues that as matter of law any wage rate anywhere within the range of the
middle 50 per cent cannot be held to be substantially below the prevailing
wage. The answer is that while the Commissioner could take it as an approach or
rule to thumb for administrative purposes that any thing within the middle 50
percent range was not substantially below prevailing wages, he cannot be heard
to assert that the Appeal Board, given by the statute appellate jurisdiction
over his determinations, necessarily erred when it held in this case that a
wage considerably lower than that enjoyed by two-thirds of those similarly employed
was substantially less favorable than prevailing wages. It is not an error of
law to say that $90 is substantially less than $103.63. The Board's holding had
a not irrational basis in the particular facts, and for the courts that is the
end of the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

more examples could well be put forward to illustrate the unreasonableness of

approach to the problem would serve in the long run to defeat the very purpose
of the statute, designed, as it were, not to regulate wages (<u>Matter of

insecurity due to involuntary unemployment by tiding over the financial strain
incident thereto (Unemployment Insurance Law [Labor Law, Art. 18]. § 501). It
appears that the holding in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Wetzig [Corsi</u>] (304 N.Y. 916)
tends to support my conclusion here. There, claimant, an experienced plier
worker in the jewelry trade, had been earning $1.10 per hour. Some five months
after having become unemployed he refused an offer of a job as a plier worker
at a wage of 90¢ per hour. The prevailing wage was based upon the union scale,

where, as here, the wage range is to wide as to render almost meaningless any

substantially less favorable may very well lie with claimant's last salary, or
the solution may be a more detailed survey which would establish separate
groups for workers based not only on the nature of the work performed but also
experience, tenure and quantum of responsibility, among other things. In any

merely $5 less per week than claimant had been earning, could under any

Whether or not in our view the charges were established so as to justify a

actually engage in any improper conduct. Accordingly, the charge that claimant
lost his employment because of misconduct in connection therewith has not been
sustained. However, the findings of the Federal agency which must be accepted
by us, do establish that claimant resigned while charges to remove him from his
position were pending. These findings compel the conclusion that claimant
voluntarily left his employment and require a decision with regard to whether
claimant had good cause for such resignation. We have repeated1y held that the
leaving of employment while charges for removal are pending is without good

reasoning which we do not accept. Claimant voluntarily resigned from his job to
suit his personal purposes, that is to avoid the stigma of a discharge on his

only if a claimant is convicted of a felony &quot;or has signed a statement
admitting that he was committed such an act.&quot; Claimant was never
prosecuted. The basis of the primary determination was that he had signed a
statement admitting that he had committed a felony. However, the statement of
April 22, 1960, by itself, does not constitute an admission of a felony. There
is no indication in that statement of the amount involved or even of the nature
of the crime. When supplemented by claimant's testimony at the hearing, the
statement would appear to refer to the commission of a felony. However, Section
593.4 provides for the disqualification only, if the statement itself shows the
commission of a felony. Since the statement relied upon in this case is
deficient in that respect, claimant cannot be disqualified under that section.
He was correctly disqualified under Section 593.3 because his actions
constituted misconduct in connection with his employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant is duly convicted of the commission of a felony in connection with his

It is conceded that claimant was not convicted of a felony in connection with

the first or second degree. The statement contains no admission to the effect
that the property wrongfully taken by claimant was valued at more than $10 nor
that claimant took such property from the person of another nor that he took
the same from any dwelling house, vessel or railway car. That the property
which he took may actually have been valued at more than $100 is immaterial in

$12,336.28, R.B. became a 50% stockholder of the corporation by purchasing
three additional shares of its capital stock for the sum of $1O,OOO. From that

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>From time to time, the
Board has considered whether a disqualification for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause applies where the unemployment stems from the
sale of stock in the corporation by which the claimant was employed. In earlier
decisions, the Board held that one who becomes unemployed because he disposes
of his interest in a corporation which he controlled or in which he held a
major interest, must be deemed to have voluntarily left his employment without
good cause (Appeal Board, 53,399; 54,153; 57,135; 60,496; 60,666). Later, in
Appeal Board, 61,586, it was established that the sale of stock which produced
the claimant's unemployment was necessary to prevent a dissolution of the
corporation and a threatened substantial loss. We there held that the sale of
the stock was for compelling reasons and consequently the unemployment of the
claimant was not due to a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause
(See also Appeal Board, 61,437 and 61,969).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Following the Board's
decision in the last mentioned case, the Division of Employment adopted a
policy to the effect that the conduct of the personal financial affairs of an
applicant for benefits, such as the sale of capital stock, should be
disregarded in determining benefit rights and accordingly, no findings should
be made that the loss of employment resulting from a sale of corporate stock is
due to a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause, since the claimant
presumably sold the stock for &quot;good and sufficient reasons from his point
of view.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

policy the local offices initially determined that claimants who had become
unemployed as a consequence of the disposal of stock interest in the
corporations by which they were employed were not subject to disqualifying
conditions. This policy was reviewed by the Board in Appeal Board, 68,663 and
we applied the Division's policy. We accordingly, sustained the initial
determination that claimant was not subject to any disqualifying conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We have now reviewed the
issue in the light of the contentions and arguments advanced by the parties
herein and, we find that there is sufficient validity and merit to the
contentions of the employer to warrant an abandonment of the principle
enunciated in Appeal Board, 68,663. It is uncontradicted that the unemployment
of the claimant is voluntary since he had agreed to a transaction which he knew
must result in the loss of his employment. If we were to hold that under all
circumstances, such a voluntary act is based on good cause, we would be
ignoring the plain mandate of the statute which provides for financial
assistance to workers who are involuntarily unemployed through no fault of
their own (Section 501) Therefore we cannot subscribe to the view that the
reasons which motivated the claimant's sale of stock are &quot;outside the
scope of local office investigations relating to rights to unemployment
insurance benefits.&quot; In our view, such an investigation must be made to
ascertain whether the reasons which caused the sale of stock, which in turn
resulted in claimant's unemployment, were compelling or merely personal. The
fact that some administrative difficulties may be encountered by the necessity
for making such investigations, does not justify the payment of benefits so
long as the statute mandates otherwise, (See e.g.&nbsp;<u>Matter of the
American Legion, Inc</u>., 10 A.D. 400, reversing Appeal Board 58,955 and&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Cassaretakis</u>, Appeal Board 4014-40 aff'd. 319 Board U.S. 306, sub,

that in each instance where a claimant becomes unemployed due to the sale of
corporate stock, the particular facts must be examined to determine whether
&quot;good cause&quot; to precipitate unemployment by such sale, existed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Applying this rule to
the facts in the case on appeal, the conclusion is inescapable that there were
no compelling reasons within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law
for claimant to have terminated his employment by the sale of stock. He entered
into an agreement for the disposition of his stock interest in the corporation
freely and without compulsion or duress and for reasons personal to himself. We
therefore conclude that claimant voluntarily left his employment without good
cause and thereby became subject to the disqualification provided for in
Section 593.1 of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

corporate structure through no fault of his own - Release A-750-1456. There are
other instances which would indicate &quot;compelling&quot; reasons such as
health, substantial change in contract of hire beyond claimant's control, etc.

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: C.S., a former employee of the employer
herein, had filed a claim for benefits on March 26, 1962. C.S. had been
employed up to March 20, 1962 by the employer for 50 weeks during his base
period. Subsequent to the termination of such employment, C.S. became employed
by another employer for whom he worked for one week through March 26, 1962. No
claim for benefits was filed by C.S. until after the termination of the
employment in which claimant engaged subsequent to his employment by the
employer herein. Since it appeared from the information furnished by C.S. upon
the filing of his claim that the employer herein was one of his base-year
employers, the local office required the employer herein to furnish written information
with respect to the period of the employment of C.S., his total earnings, his
last day of work and specifically to state whether the employer knew of any
reason why the said C.S. may not be eligible for benefits. The employer
complied with the request and on March 29, 1962, mailed to the local office its
reply. The employer in response to the inquiry with respect to its knowledge of
any reasons for ineligibility, indicated that claimant had quit voluntarily
without notice or cause and that work was now available for him. The local
office personnel concluded that no disqualification would be imposed by reason
of the circumstances under which the employment of C.S. by the employer herein
was terminated for the reason that such employment was not the last employment
of C.S. prior to the filing. However, the local office personnel inadvertently
failed to give significance to the employer's statement that work was available
for the claimant and, therefore, contrary to prescribed procedure, the local office
personnel failed to refer claimant to the employer for reemployment.
Notwithstanding the information received from the employer, the local office
personnel initially determined that C.S. was eligible for benefits without
disqualifying conditions and on the basis of such initial determination,
benefits were paid. For the<i>&nbsp;</i>weeks ending April 29 and May 6, 1962,
benefits aggregating $41 were paid C.S<i>.&nbsp;</i>and experience rating
charges were made against the employer's account for such payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The employer contended
that the benefits paid to C.S. should not have been charged against the
employer's account for the reason that the initial determination ruling
claimant eligible for benefits was issued inadvertently by the local office
personnel who failed to follow prescribed procedure and failed to refer
claimant to the employer for reemployment in pursuance of the information which
the employer had furnished to the local office. Although it was conceded on
behalf of the Commissioner's representative that there appeared to be merit in
the contention advanced by the employer, the Commissioner was, nevertheless,
constrained to overrule the employer's protest because of the principle
enunciated by us in Appeal Board 59,640 and Appeal Board, 44,169. On this
appeal by the employer, written statements were submitted on behalf of the
Industrial Commissioner urging us to reconsider the principles set forth in the
cited cases and upon such reconsideration to rule that the experience rating
charges should be removed from the employer's account and the benefits paid to
C.S. should be charged against the general account. It is pointed out by the
Commissioner that in view of the omission of the local office representative in
having inadvertently failed to refer C.S. for reemployment, fairness to the
employer requires that it should not be penalized by the experience rating
charge against its account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

charging of the benefits paid to C.S. to the general account rather than to the
account of the employer. Since the employer was<i>&nbsp;</i>actually prepared
to rehire C.S., and since the offer of rehire was not conveyed to the claimant
only because of the inadvertence of the local office representatives, it would
be inequitable and unjust to penalize the employer, by charging its account
with the benefits paid to C.S. without having first tested his eligibility by
exposing him to the job opportunity made available, for him by the employer.
The employer should not suffer by reason of error on the part of the local
office personnel (Compare with&nbsp;<u>Matter or Rae Horowitz</u>, 271 App.

other employments but for five days per week during one period of over three
years preceding 1953. So far as appears, his last employment, other than as a
cab driver, terminated in 1960, after which he continued his part-time work for

determination of claimant’s entitlement to benefits was overruled by a Referee
on the express authority of this court’s decision in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Tucker
(Lubin)</u>&nbsp;(8 A.D. 2d 859). The case was reopened by the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board, however, and the Referee’s decision rescinded and the
initial determination sustained after&nbsp;<u>Tucker</u>&nbsp;was reversed by
the Court of Appeals (8 N.Y. 2d 1145). It seems clear, however, that our
decision in&nbsp;<u>Tucker</u>&nbsp;was reversed because this court was found
to have erred in overruling a purely factual determination which the Court of
Appeals held was supported by substantial evidence. The statute provides:
&quot;No benefits shall be payable in to any claimant who is not capable of
work or who is not ready, willing and able to work in his usual
employment&nbsp;<u>or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by
training and experience</u>.&quot; (Labor Law, §591, subd. 2; emphasis
supplied.) In Tucker, the Court of Appeals held &quot;that there was adequate
support in the record for the board’s finding that claimant was not reasonably
fitted by training and experience to take a position as typist&quot;. (8 N.Y.
2d 1145, 1147.) In this case there was no finding that claimant was not
&quot;reasonably fitted by training and experience&quot; for work in his
&quot;other&quot; employment; and in view of his continuous experience in the
latter work and his annual licensure, over a period of many years, by the New
York City bureau having jurisdiction, it could not well be found or, indeed,
sensibly argued that he was not so fitted. The decision of the board in this
case proceeds upon its finding of &quot;primary occupation&quot;, a ground for
which the Tucker case seems to us to afford no authority and for which no
support can be found in the clear and unambiguous language of the statute. The
board’s conclusion that what claimant &quot;has done in the past 25 years
establishes that his primary occupation is as a public relations man&quot;
seems to us irrelevant and, more important, an improper basis for the decision
and one unauthorized by the statutory provisions as to&nbsp;<u>any</u>&nbsp;other
employment for which a claimant is fitted. The test of &quot;primary
occupation&quot;, which the board thus adopts, would render largely ineffective
the alternative provision respecting &quot;any other&quot; appropriate
employment, and this despite the clear fact that the Legislature has placed the
latter in complete parity with &quot;usual employment&quot;. While the board’s
term, &quot;primary occupation&quot;, might conceivably be equated with
&quot;usual employment&quot; for some purposes, certainly it may not be when
the effect is to exclude all employments but the &quot;primary&quot; one. (See
Matter of Delgado [Corsi], 278 App. Div. 237.) The result seems harsh only if
the purpose of the statute be lost sight of. &quot;[T]he full utilization of
all skills is not the effective test to be applied under the statute, but
rather the availability of work for which the claimant is fitted by training
and experience&quot;. (<u>Matter of Greaser</u>&nbsp;[<u>Corsi</u>], 279 App.
Div. 702, 703).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer advised the bargaining unit that its supervisory force was being
reduced and that three salaried supervisory employees were being returned to
their former jobs and restored to the bargaining unit with seniority to date
back to their last respective dates of hire. At the time a number of union
members were on layoff status. Opposition to the company's action was expressed
by officials of the local union on the ground that it was a breach of the union
contract. A request was made of the employer that it shut down the plant to
permit a meeting of the union membership, which request was denied. The subject
of the dispute was discussed at a regular meeting of the local on October 26.
It was decided to seek advice and guidance from the international union. At a
special meeting of the local held on Saturday, October 29, the district
representative of the international union was present and addressed the
membership. The district representative stated that the union contract was
silent concerning the matter in dispute and he expressed the view that the
employer was in violation of the contract in returning the supervisory
employees to the bargaining unit and that, therefore, the union contract was no
longer in effect. The matter of any further action was left in the hands of the
membership of the local. No official strike vote was taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were discharged in violation of the union agreement. The arbitration board

their employment because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in
which they were employed. Claimants did not contest such determinations. By
further initial determinations, claimants were disqualified from receiving
benefits effective November 3, 1960 on the ground that they lost their
employment through misconduct in connection with their employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this appeal is whether or not claimants' loss of employment was due to
misconduct in connection with their employment, as contemplated by Section 594
of the Law. The first phase of this issue which we must consider is whether or
not the participation by claimants in a strike which was in violation of a no
strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement, of itself, constituted
misconduct in connection with employment within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law, as contended by the employer and the Industrial Commissioner.
The second phase is whether or not claimants committed individual acts of
misconduct during the pendency of the strike, as distinct from their
participation in the strike, and will be discussed later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1960 on the ground that they lost their employment because of an industrial

readily apparent that the disqualifications for misconduct, insofar as they are
based on participation in this so-called &quot;illegal&quot; strike, arise out
of the same facts as led to the strike suspensions. The question of whether or
not both the strike suspension and the misconduct disqualification can be
simultaneously applied has never been decided in our courts. Notwithstanding
our decision in Appeal Board, 42,816-54, a look backward at the history of

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The first attempt to
pass an unemployment insurance bill in this State was in 1933. The proposed
1933 act provided for no stoppage of benefits in the case of loss of employment
due to a labor dispute. It did contain a provision for an extended waiting
period in the case of loss of employment through misconduct, but specifically
provided that &quot;leaving or losing employment due to a trade dispute&quot;
shall not constitute misconduct. (S. 2385, Int. No. 208; A. 2878, Int. No.
533). The proposed act of 1934 provided for an extended waiting period for loss
of employment due to strikes but specifically limited it to strikes &quot;not
caused by a breach of agreement on the part of the employer&quot; or by other
acts abridging the rights of employees (S.2162, Int. No.630; A. 2714, Int.
No.826). The original Unemployment Insurance Act (Chapter 468 of the Laws of
1935) provided extended waiting periods of ten weeks for loss of employment
either through misconduct or because of a strike, but significantly, it cast
them in the alternative, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an extended waiting period was dropped and in its place was substituted a
suspension of benefit rights for seven consecutive weeks. The then Section 504
(a) provided the identical suspension for loss of employment through misconduct
or because of a strike. The key language &quot;lost his employment because of a
strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which
he was employed&quot; and the seven weeks suspension period have remained in
the statute unchanged to this day. The penalty for loss of employment through
misconduct, however, was again changed in 1958 into a disqualification of 42
consecutive days. At the same time the misconduct provision was removed from
Section 592 labeled &quot;Suspension of accumulation of benefit rights&quot;
and placed in Section 593 labeled &quot;Disqualification for benefits.&quot;
The present disqualification for misconduct which can be broken only by
subsequent employment or earnings in stated amounts was enacted in 1960.

apparent that throughout the history of this legislation the Legislature has
regarded and treated the misconduct and strike provisions as separate
disqualifications. While it has not varied the period of withholding of
benefits in strike cases since 1941, the penalty in misconduct cases has been
changed several times. The intention to apply only the suspension of benefits

settlement of the differences between the employer and the employees. This

consistently followed the line that the merits of the industrial controversy
are immaterial to a decision on the issue of whether or not an industrial
controversy existed. No distinction has ever been made between strikes which
violate a law or a contract provision and those which do not. In&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Crealey</u>, 280 App. Div. 845, reversing Appeal Board, 27,071-51, the Court
held that an industrial controversy existed within the statute even though the
employer had obtained an order in the Supreme Court enjoining picketing on the
ground that no labor dispute, as defined by Section 876 a. of the Civil
Practice Act, existed at its establishment. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Sprague</u>, 4
App. Div. 2d 911, reversing Appeal Board, 54,608-56, 54,609-56, 54,610-56; an
industrial controversy was found to exist even though there were no differences
between claimants and their respective employers, where the claimants became
unemployed due to a work stoppage at an air base, caused by the establishment
of a picket line by a union for the purpose of exerting pressure on the Air
Force to reinstate a contract for the employment of union labor. So also
in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Klein et al</u>, 15 App. Div. 2d 201, reversing Appeal
Board, 67,939-59, affirmed 12 N.Y. 2d 678 where the Court found an industrial
controversy to have existed when the employer discharged 18 window trimmers who
refused to comply with conditions of continued employment imposed by the
employer, notwithstanding that no picketing or other manifestations of an
industrial controversy took place prior to the discharges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the question of industrial controversy is consonant with authorities in other

on the ground that a labor dispute ceases to be after a decision concerning its

refused to abide by such determinations. There the Court said in its opinion at

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Irrespective of the
rights or obligations of the parties under the written contract, an industrial
controversy existed in the instant cases. The right of labor to organize or to
strike is a fundamental one. The strike with which we are here dealing,
represented concerted action on the part of the whole union membership in an
effort to air their grievance and a determination by them to refrain from
working until the difference was settled. That the use of the strike weapon may
be in derogation of a written agreement does not abridge that right, since
there may be times that the very existence of the union is threatened
(See&nbsp;<u>Mastro Plastics v NLRB,</u>&nbsp;350 U.S. 278). It is generally
recognized in federal decisions that disputes relating to violations of
no-strike clauses are arbitrable&nbsp;<u>(Signal Stat. Corp. v. Local&nbsp;</u>475,235

conclude that the Legislature must have intended that subsection (1)(b) [the

disputes in order to foreclose the possibility of indirectly financing persons
who are actively engaged in work stoppage during the time they are so engaged
and are consequently unemployed. Otherwise, many of the provisions of the Act
could be used interchangeably to inflict penalties of long duration in cases
where unemployment arises out of industrial controversies. (Also see&nbsp;<u>Canter
v. The Appeal Board et al and the Budd Co.,</u>&nbsp;<u>Circuit Court, Wayne
County</u>, December 18, 1958;&nbsp;<u>The Labor Market and Employment Security</u>,&nbsp;<u>U.S.

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>To go further and impose
the misconduct disqualifications for mere participation in the strike would
require an inquiry into the merits. We are now convinced that this is not the
proper forum to inquire into or to determine the merits of such a controversy
or to decide questions of legality on the part 0£ either of the opposing sides.
If there has been a breach of contract between the parties, adequate remedies
are provided by law for the aggrieved party. We conclude, therefore, that the
disqualifications for misconduct cannot be sustained on the basis of the mere
participation by the claimants in the industrial controversy, regardless of its
merits or legality. Insofar as our own decision in Appeal Board, 42,816-54 is
in conflict with this view, the rule enunciated in said decision is rescinded.
We proceed now to the remaining question of whether or not the claimants by
individual acts, independent of their mere participation in the strike,
committed misconduct so as to be subject to the disqualification provisions of
Section 593.3 of the Law. We recognize that acts or conduct of claimants
committed during the course of the strike or on a picket line may constitute
misconduct and subject them to disqualifications on that ground. We so held in
Appeal Board 80,096-61 where we found to be misconduct actions characterized as
conduct which &quot;overstepped the bounds of legal and peaceful
picketing&quot;; conduct which &quot;evinced a wilful and wanton disregard of
the employer's interests and was in deliberate violation and disregard of
standards of behavior which an employer has a right to expect of its
employees&quot;; actions which &quot;were sufficiently identified with violence
or threat of violence to warrant a finding that their subsequent loss of
employment was occasioned by acts of misconduct&quot; and &quot;aggressive acts
of a deliberate nature resulting in prejudice to the employer's
interests.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The employer selected
the claimants for discharge on the basis of its observations of their conduct
during the course of the strike. Protracted hearings were held before the Board
at which each individual case was separately treated. Voluminous testimony was
taken and numerous exhibits including photographs were received in evidence. We
have carefully examined the entire record in the case and we reach the
conclusion that the alleged acts of misconduct charged were not of such a
nature as to warrant a finding of misconduct in connection with employment
under the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We do not deem it
necessary to separately discuss each case. The employer's charges in the main
fall into two categories. First, there are the activities of certain claimants
on October 31 in allegedly instigating, developing and maintaining the strike,
persuading others not to work and assuming leadership of the strikers, all in
violation of the no-strike clause of the labor agreement. Secondly, there are
those based on the alleged wrongful conduct on November 1 and 2 of the same and
other claimants who were described as &quot;overly active&quot; in connection
with the mass picketing which took place on those days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The activities of the
claimants in the first category were described by the employer's representatives
generally as &quot;overly active&quot; and as being more than the roles of
on-lookers or bystanders. Some of the acts occurred prior to the strike. The
charges that some of the claimants persuaded others not to report for work are
not supported by any direct evidence. As far as the record shows, claimants who
were union officers and who held discussions with groups of strikers may well
have been approached in their official capacity for information as to the
progress of the strike. The exercise of leadership by itself, absent overt acts
of a wilful or menacing nature and overstepping the bounds of propriety is not
misconduct. We hold with respect to the charges in the first category that the
proof falls short of showing any overt acts which might be branded as
misconduct within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

charges is more closely allied with the field of violence and aggressiveness.
However, the evidence before us does not reflect acts of a sufficiently serious
nature to warrant a holding of misconduct. The shouting, pushing, shoving and
participation in the surges during the mass picketing was not shown to be of
such a violent or menacing nature as to brand these acts as deliberate and
wantonly in disregard of the employer's interests. The charges stem largely out
of incidents arising of the mass picketing. About 1OO strikers were involved in
the mass picketing at a time. The evidence does not show that any of the
individual claimants were the leaders or the motivating force in these
activities. It would appear that claimants who were<b>&nbsp;</b>charged in this
respect in most instances were merely part of a mass action and by pure chance
were found in particular locations and in contact with the police officers at
the moment of a breakthrough. There is absent here, any substantial proof of a
design on the part of claimants to create an atmosphere of fear and
intimidation with respect to their co-employees, or of intentional aggressive
acts of violence or belligerence warranting the disqualifications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the vast majority of employing establishments throughout the State,

Typical of these situations is the usual vacation arrangements for the vast
majority of clerical and executive employees. Rarely is there a written formal
designation of the annual vacation period. If the referee's construction of
Section 591.3 of the Law were accepted such employees would be deemed to suffer

the omission of the writing does not render the section ineffectual.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Recently, in Appeal
Board, 90,801, we had occasion to determine whether a loss of employment which
results from a claimant's sale of the stock of the corporation in which he had
a controlling interest and by which he was employed, constitutes a voluntary
leaving of employment within the purview of the Unemployment Insurance Law. We
concluded that, under such circumstances, there is a voluntary leaving of
employment and that &quot;in each instance where a claimant becomes unemployed
due to the sale of corporate stock, the particular facts must be examined to
determine whether 'good cause' to precipitate unemployment by such sale
existed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the instant case,
claimant's unemployment stemmed from the sale of the corporate
&quot;business&quot; rather than from a sale of the stock in the corporate
employer. Nevertheless, claimant, as a principal stockholder, participated in
the decision of the employer to dispose of the property and, without objection,
protest or dissent, joined with the remaining principals of the corporation in
the disposition of the corporate property which provided claimant with
employment. Under these circumstances, we conclude that, for the purpose of
determining claimant's rights under the Unemployment Insurance Law, she is in
substantially the same position as though her unemployment had stemmed from the
sale of her corporate stock. Accordingly, our reasoning in Appeal Board, 90,801
applies and our decision therein is incorporated herein by reference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that claimant voluntarily left her employment within the intent of Section
593.1 of the Law, it is necessary to determine whether such voluntary leaving
was based on good cause. There is no proof to establish that there was any
compelling need for the sale of the hotel. It was sold, solely, because in the
judgment of the principals of the corporation, it was to their economic
advantage to accept the offer made by the university which would enable them to
make a profitable sale. This is a purely personal reason which was not of such
compelling nature as to provide good cause for the termination of employment
which was a necessary sequence to the sale. Accordingly, we hold that claimant
voluntarily left her employment without god cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

September 19, 1962. On September 20, 1962, the finishers and the other piece
workers reported to their union and complained that the employer had refused to
pay them holiday pay for Labor Day, 1962, to which they were entitled pursuant
to the collective bargaining agreement. On the advice of the union, the
pieceworkers and finishers stopped working on September 20, and did not return
to work until two weeks later when they were advised by their union that the
matter had been settled and that they would be paid for the holiday. No work
was available for claimant and other timeworkers, due to the fact that the
pieceworkers and finishers were not working. Accordingly, claimant was laid
off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>There was no picketing
of the employer's establishment. The employer was not prevented from hiring
other employees to replace those who had refused to work. The employer paid its
employees for the Labor Day Holiday, on their ultimate return to work. The
employer had paid the claimant and other timeworkers for the holiday but was
unable to pay the pieceworkers and the finisher's holiday pay at the time they
were entitled to be paid because she was then without funds. She testified at
the hearing before the Board that because of other troubles with the union,
business had been bad and she was without funds to pay the money although she
recognized that under the contract, she was obligated to pay the pieceworkers
and the finishers for the holiday. There was no interpretive difference between
the employer and the union regarding the workers' rights to holiday pay under
the contract. The employer had been having a running dispute with the union<i>&nbsp;</i>on
other matters relating to price schedules which were not related to her
obligation to pay holiday pay to the workers involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The evidence now
before the Board establishes that the work stoppage in the employer's
establishment on September 20, 1962, was occasioned by the employer's inability
to pay to the piece workers and finishers the wages due to them as holiday pay
and not due to an interpretive difference regarding the contract. The
employer's failure to make the holiday payment was not occasioned by any
industrial controversy or labor dispute but rather was due to the employer's
lack of funds. The fact that the union counselled the workers to remain away
from work until they received payment due to them did not operate to make the
matter an industrial controversy. The employer's dispute with the union
regarding price schedules had nothing to do with the work stoppage. Under the
circumstances of this case, claimant's unemployment beginning September 20,
1962 was not due to an industrial controversy and consequently, the statutory
suspension is inapplicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
