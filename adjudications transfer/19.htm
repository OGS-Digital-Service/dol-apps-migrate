filed an original claim for benefits effective December 31. Claimant has
operated a 12-acre cattle farm, owned by him and his wife, for approximately 13
years. The farm maintains 30 to 35 heads of cattle. During the period under
review, claimant spent two to three hours a day feeding and taking care of the
cattle. He also maintained the farm machinery and buildings. In 1979, the sale
of cattle amounted to $4,899.53 and the farm realized a net profit of $378.
Claimant has no employees, but his wife occasionally helps out. In non-winter
months the claimant also purchases seed and fertilizer, plants corn in the
spring, and harvests it in the fall. Even when claimant was working full time
elsewhere he always spent several hours a day before and after work, operating
the farm.</span></p>

     services in the operation of a farm and in raising pigs, some of which he

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It is a well
     established principle that choosing to be laid off rather than accepting a
     transfer to another job at a reduced rate of pay is a leaving without good
     cause, provided the offered employment meets the statutory tests of
     prevailing wages and suitability (<u>Matter of Bus</u>, 32 NY 2d 955;
     A-75O-1741). This principle applies to employees in the public as well as
     the private sector.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Inherent in the
     present decision is the further principle that an employee assigned to a
     position provisionally suffers no change in the terms and conditions of
     employment when reverting to his permanent position. Neither claimant's
     length of service in the provisional title, nor the salary reduction
     incurred in reverting to the permanent title is relevant in determining
     whether there is good cause for leaving.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>a. In another case
     concerning a public employee, claimant had been appointed provisionally to
     a position as Office Assistant. She was also on a civil service eligible
     list for lower level position, Office Aide. Claimant was to be replaced in
     her provisional position by another employee who was being permanently
     appointed. She was offered a permanent appointment as Office Aide at a
     substantial lower salary. By refusing the offer, claimant constructively
     resigned, there being no other position for her. In deciding that claimant
     did not have good cause for voluntary leaving, the Appeal Board held that
     &quot;she was reasonably fitted by training and experience for the
     position ...by virtue of her passing the civil service examination for
     that position&quot; (A.B. 314,137, not reported). The Appeal Board's
     conclusion is that an individual is fitted by training and experience for
     a public employment job, if he has passed a civil service examination for
     that position.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>b. In
another case the claimant had permanent civil service status as a Stenographer,
and later accepted a provisional appointment to the position of Supervising
Clerk with substantial salary increase. After almost one year in the higher,
provisional title, that position was eliminated. Claimant resigned rather than
revert to her permanent civil service position. In sustaining the initial
determination of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause, the Appeal
Board held that &quot;Claimant knew that her provisional appointment was
subject to elimination and that she might be required to return to her
permanent title.&quot; This concept is inherent in all cases of public
employees whose provisional appointments are terminated and who refuse to
return to their permanent positions (<u>Matter of Steinberg</u>, affirming
without opinion A.B. 266,358; not reported).</span></p>

the statutory weeks ending December 17, 1979 through February 17, 1980 and the
statutory week ending March 9, 1980, claimant certified during each and every
reporting period that he was not employed. Claimant knew that he worked and
that his certifications were false. As a result of these certifications he
received benefits totaling $625.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>1. In several recent decisions
concerning the number of effective days to be imposed as a forfeit penalty upon
a principal of a business (corporation, partnership or individual
proprietorship) who conceals services rendered in either employment or
self-employment, the Appeal Board held:</span></p>
<ol start=1 type=a>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&quot;Each week
     when claimant certified that he had done no work in employment or
     self-employment, his certification was a&nbsp;<u>separate offense</u>&nbsp;[underscoring
     supplied] since it concerned activities in different weeks. A penalty of
     eight effective days could have been imposed for each certification.&quot;
     (A.B.268,667; not reported)</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;line-height:normal'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&quot;Claimant
     should have been penalized... as follows:</span></li>
</ol>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>eight days
for each of the weeks for which he received benefits as a result of his wilful
misrepresentation and concealment of employment, and four days when no benefits
were paid.&quot; (A.B. 282,949; not reported)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>2. The present case concerned a
claimant who certified to having done no work in employment or self-employment
for ten weeks (1 waiting period and nine compensable weeks). The administrative
law judge in sustaining the determination of wilful misrepresentation, modified
the forfeit penalty of 76 effective days to be 22 effective days because
&quot;the services were more in the nature of self-employment rather than
employment.&quot; The Appeal Board, in modifying the decision of the
administrative law judge and sustaining the initial determination, held,
&quot;It is of no consequence that the services rendered were either in
self-employment or as an employee for an employer. Claimant made a wilful
misrepresentation pertaining to his employment during each week that he
certified for benefits during the period at issue.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>3. Inherent in the Appeal Board's
holding is a change in the basis used for calculating the forfeit penalty in
cases involving false certifications to total unemployment by a principal of a
business. Previously, activities in self employment were considered to be a
matter of &quot;status&quot;, and as such, wilful false certifications to being
totally unemployed were deemed to be repetitions of a single offense. However,
each wilful concealment of services rendered as an employee for an employer
constituted a separate offense (Special Bulletin A710-21, IIA).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In the present case the Appeal
Board eradicates the distinction between self-employment activities and those
rendered in employment. Thus, self-employment like employment, in one week is
not the same fact as it is in another week. Specifically, each certification,
whether relating to self-employment or employment, is a separate offense
justifying a separate penalty: a forfeiture of four effective days for each
week if no overpayment results from the offense and eight effective days for
each week if an overpayment does result.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>4. In cases pertaining to
concealment of self-employment, the court held that &quot;it is claimant's
responsibility to make a full and complete disclosure of all pertinent facts
which might be determinative of his right to benefits&quot; (<u>Matter of
Marder,</u>&nbsp;16 AD 2d 303); that &quot;silence when there is a duty to
speak, constitutes wilful misrepresentation&quot;&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Galitzer,</u>&nbsp;2
AD 2d 923); that claimant has a &quot;duty to make appropriate inquiry of local
office&quot; and &quot;...was not privileged to speculate on the legal affects
of his activities&quot;&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Vick,</u>&nbsp;12 AD 2d 120).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On March 9, 1979, claimant was
informed by the employer that a reduction in enrollment necessitated the
elimination of her position and that it was to be terminated, effective June
30, 1979. This was confirmed on June 18, 1979 in another letter from the
employer. On June 21, 1979, claimant was informed by the business office of the
school district that it would be possible for her to pay her health insurance
premiums during the summer of 1979 directly to the carrier.</span></p>

mathematics and social studies. On August 10, 1979<i>,&nbsp;</i>claimant was
notified that she had been appointed as a teacher in the school district. She
notified the local office of this and discontinued her claim. She started to
work, for the employer in September, 1979 as a 7th grade social studies
teacher.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Opinion:</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;The
issue in this case is whether claimant was employed on an annual contract which
ended August 31, 1979. If not, having been excessed as of June 30, the end of
the school year, she would be entitled to benefits like any other person who
became unemployed through no fault of her own.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In this case, there was no evidence
of any kind to establish that there was any discussion of the term of
employment between the school district and claimant. We must, therefore, look
to their actions in order to determine their intent. In this case, there was no
written notice of appointment stating that it was for one year, effective
September 1, 1978 (See Appeal Board Nos. 306,854A; 306,857A; 306,858A) or
effective September 1, 1977, at a stated annual salary (See Appeal Board No.
306, 229A), as has been done in other school districts. In the instant case,
the affirmative acts of the school district in notifying claimant that her
employment was terminated as of June 30, the end of the school year, and that
she had to pay for her health insurance after that date, point to the
conclusion that the employer did not consider that claimant was employed under
an annual contract which ended on August 31. To conclude that there was an
annual contract, under these circumstances, is pure fantasy. It would be
unconscionable to deny benefits to one whose employment has been terminated,
simply because that person was a teacher in one of the public schools in this
state. To conclude that an annual contract existed, despite the lack of any
proof thereof, would make all public school teachers ineligible for benefits,
regardless of any other circumstances. Such a rule must be mandated by the
legislature. It has not done so, especially as to teachers who have been
excessed. Significantly, the legislature has mandated only that teachers who
continue employment from year to year and have reasonable assurance of such
continued employment, cannot qualify for benefits during the summer months
(Labor Law, Section 590.10).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>It has been suggested that the
terms of the employment agreement may be spelled out from custom, usage and
practice, supported by the collective bargaining agreement between the
teachers' union and the school district. However, this ignores the fact that
all parties agree that the collective bargaining agreement is not a contract of
employment. This leaves only custom, usage and practice from which to define
the terms of this claimant's employment. It is well known that teachers in the
public schools work only during the ten month school year, from September
through the following June. They do not work during July and August. Summer
school employment is a matter of separate hiring and payment. It is also
significant that the collective bargaining agreement does not refer to annual
salaries for teachers, but only to base salaries, and that the school calendar
covers only ten months, from September through June. If anything, custom, usage
and practice establish that the period of such employment is the ten-month
school year.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>It should be noted that prior to
January 1, 1978, public school teachers were not able to qualify for
unemployment insurance benefits, and that the collective bargaining agreement
herein ran for three years, from July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1979. Clearly, the
school district and the union did not consider that teachers were employed
under an annual contract.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Moreover, it should be noted that
the school district no longer urges that the option given to the teacher to be
paid in 26 installments is the basis for the contention that claimant worked
under an annual contract which ends on August 31. It relies solely on the
original probationary appointment and urges that each renewal of employment was
for one year, rather than for the ten month school year. The evidence herein
does not support this contention.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence now before
the Board establishes that the term of the appointment for each year after the
probationary period was not discussed or even considered by the school district
or the teacher. The notice of probationary appointment does not define the
period of probation and states only that it is effective September 1. The
school district contends it was for one year, ending August 31 of the following
year. The affirmative actions of the school district indicate otherwise. It has
long been established that any ambiguity in a document must be resolved against
the author&nbsp;<u>(Rentways v<i>.&nbsp;</i>O'Neil Milk</u>, 308 NY 342).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In our view the probationary period
in this case was the period in which claimant rendered services as a teacher -
the school year, which ran from September through the following June. It cannot
be extended to include a period during which the teacher does not work and
cannot be observed. W<i>e&nbsp;</i>have recently considered a case in which the
collective bargaining agreement between the teachers' union and a school
district in Westchester Community provides that the first salary step ends on
June 30 following the commencement of the appointment. (Appeal Board No.
312,149)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We need not speculate about the
pension system of teachers or that a teacher may be credited with a full year
of service, even though he or she worked only during the ten month school year.
The pension system does not establish the term of each period of employment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We are not aware of any decision by
our appellate courts to the effect that the teachers in our public schools are
12-month employees. The cases usually cited indicate that the courts will not
set aside a decision by the Appeal Board in which it has found a 12-month
contract, provided there is substantial evidence to support such conclusion.
These cases are readily distinguishable. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Darwin&nbsp;</u>(30
AD 2d 996) claimant was a state civil servant, who was hired on a 12 month
basis, and was assigned to a mental hospital as a teacher. He was not required
to teach while school was not in session. He was not excessed from his job and
returned to teach after the summer.&nbsp;<u>Utter</u>&nbsp;(52 AD 2d 994)
and&nbsp;<u>Wolfson</u>&nbsp;(57 AD 2d 10) were teachers in private school who
were found to have been hired on an annual basis.&nbsp;<u>Utter</u>&nbsp;conceded
this in his appeal to the court. Wolfson was hired and paid for 12-months, but
his vacation pay for July and August was deferred until the following December.
Neither was excessed from his job. The claimant herein is not a state civil
servant, nor did she concede a hiring for 12 months, nor was she given any
vacation pay for July and August.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>No single affirmative act or piece
of evidence has been produced to compel the conclusion that there was an annual
contract of employment for this claimant. The only affirmative acts - the
notice that claimant was excessed as of June 30, and the employer's cutting off
the health benefits which it had provided until that date indicate that she was
not employed under an annual contract that ended on August 31.</span></p>

individuals, the Department of Transportation instituted an investigation and
found that, during 1980, the claimant issued &quot;ghost summonses&quot;. These
are summonses which use vehicle identification information from previously
issued summonses but which are issued against vehicles without any actual
violation and are used to enhance an agent's productivity record. The
investigation was completed after claimant joined the Police Department. The

because of claimant's wilful misrepresentations a forfeit penalty of 58

Supreme Court, Third Department. Pursuant to Rule 800.12 of that Court, the
claimant's appeal was deemed to have been abandoned one year after the date of
the said Board decision. The claimant filed an original claim for benefits on
August 6, 1980 after this separation from his employment as an insurance agent
on August 4, 1980. Since it had been ruled that the claimant had been overpaid
benefits and that the overpayment was recoverable, in keeping with local office
procedures, the claimant was asked to sign a special pay order each week when
he reported to claim benefits. That pay order contains the following: &quot;I
KNOW THAT THIS CERTIFICATION IS TO BE USED AS A CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT SHOWN
ABOVE AGAINST THE BENEFITS I WAS OVERPAID.&quot; The &quot;amount shown
above&quot; was the claimant's benefit rate. Claimant refused to sign these

signed statements at the local office that he was refusing to sign these pay

the case now before the Board, no appeal was taken from the decision of the

disqualifying the claimant from receiving benefits effective August 4, 1980

perceives no basis to reconsider that portion of the decision, it remains the
law of the case that the claimant's separation from that employment occurred

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence now before
the Board establishes that the claimant refused to comply with the directives
of the local office that he sign special pay orders which contained a statement
in which he would acknowledge that his current benefits were being applied as a
credit against a prior recoverable overpayment. A claimant is required to file
a claim for benefits within such time and &quot;in such manner&quot; as the
Commissioner shall prescribe (Labor Law Section 596.1). In&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Soto.&nbsp;</u>(35 AD 2d 395, aff'g A.B. 156,913) the Court recognized the
right of the Industrial Commissioner to practice setoff when the claimant is
entitled to current benefits which are less that the debt owed by that claimant
to the Department of Labor. The primary issue in this case is whether the
Industrial Commissioner may require a claimant to sign a special pay order in
which he acknowledges that his current certification is to be used as a credit
against prior benefits which the claimant had been overpaid. During the period
in issue, the claimant's appeal to the Appellate Division was still pending. In
effect, by reason of that pending appeal, he was denying that there was a prior
recoverable overpayment. Had he signed the special pay order, he would have
been acknowledging a prior recoverable overpayment. Although we do not question
that the Industrial Commissioner may practice offset in appropriate situations,
we find that the Industrial Commissioner's requirement in this case, that such
a pay order be signed, is an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we conclude that
the claimant's refusal to sign that special pay order does not constitute a
failure to comply with reporting requirements. Our decision in no way limits
the power of the Industrial Commissioner to practice offset with regard to
current benefits when there is a prior overpayment. Should a claimant refuse to
sign the special pay order, the Industrial Commissioner could then require the
claimant to sign the usual pay order which does not contain an acknowledgment
of a prior recoverable overpayment. Once the claimant has signed that regular
pay order the Industrial Commissioner may proceed to recover overpayments by
whatever other means may be available. The Commissioner cannot use the special
pay order in this case.</span></p>

issue before the Board is whether the claimant's benefit rate is to be reduced

6OO.7(a) of the Law provides for a reduction of the pro-rated weekly amount of
a pension which the claimant &quot;is receiving.&quot; Subparagraph (b) of that
subdivision provides that unemployment benefits shall be paid without a
reduction if &quot;it has not been established that the claimant will be
receiving a pension.&quot; That subparagraph provides for a review of those
unemployment insurance benefits as with a retroactive payment of remuneration.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>It is the law of the case that the
claimant's benefit rate be reduced by $64 by reason of receipts of his social
security pension. The evidence establishes that the claimant is entitled to a
pension from the State Employees Retirement System. At this time, the claimant
is not &quot;receiving&quot; the pension but his rights to that pension have
been &quot;established&quot; and an approximate monthly payment amount has
'been determined. Since the employer wholly contributed to the pension portion
of the payment from the retirement system, the claimant's benefit rate would be
reduced by the pro-rated weekly amount of that payment. It would be necessary
for the monthly estimate to be over $120 in error before the claimant's benefit
rate would be reduced to an amount in access (sic) of $0 when considering the
pension alone. When the Social Security payments are also considered, the
monthly estimate would have to be about $400 in error before the claimant would
be entitled to receive any unemployment insurance benefits following such reduction.
Since the claimant's rights have been &quot;established&quot; [subparagraph
(b)], the six month period during which the local office may review the
claimant's benefit rate and recover any overpayment has begun to run (See
Appeal Board 309,925 where estimates of the retirement payment could be made
but a final determination of the pension had not been made). Accordingly, we
conclude that it was proper for the local office to reduce the claimant's
benefit rate to $0 based on his Social Security benefits and the estimated
amount of his retirement pension. Should the estimate eventually be found to be
in error, the local office would have one year from the date of the initial
determination herein (Labor Law Section 597.3) to revise the said initial
determination and to pay any benefits which may be due to the claimant if the
error is in excess of approximately $400 a month.</span></p>

been structured to meet the needs of the community. The Board of Education
established a program calendar for each fiscal year which provides for a
&quot;201 Day Instructional Year,&quot; to conform to requirements of the State
Education Department that 201 days of instruction be offered. The Board of
Education adjusted the program calendar so as to meet that requirement. Other
than days when school was closed for civic or religious observances, the
calendar for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1978 provided for breaks in
instruction from July 1 through July 9, 1978, from August 12 through September
10, 1978, from December 16, 1978 through January 1, 1979, and from April 12

was confirmed and that classes for the year would begin on July 10,1978. The

initial determination herein applies to the four extended interruptions in the
201 day calendar required for this program. The Board, therefore, will resolve
whether each of these interruptions constitutes a period between an academic
year or term within the meaning of the statute and, if so, whether the claimant

Notwithstanding that it did not guarantee re-employment because of factors such
as budget, enrollment and registration, nevertheless, considering all of the
facts, including the work history of the claimant since 1967, we conclude that
she had a reasonable assurance of re-employment. Since claimant also received a
calendar for the 1979 fiscal year, we conclude that she had a reasonable
assurance of re-employment. Since claimant also received a calendar for the
1979 fiscal year, we conclude that she had a reasonable assurance of
re-employment in the term following each of the extended interruptions. Accordingly,
the weeks of employment and remuneration of the claimant with the educational

wherein the Court ruled that the filing of a claim while on leave of absence is
not a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Even prior to&nbsp;<u>Wilner</u>&nbsp;the
Board had ruled that where a claimant was laid off indefinitely there was no
reason for her disqualification for voluntary leaving of employment on any
basis as of the day following the layoff and that her overt act in notifying
the employer at the time of the layoff that she would not return cannot convert
the layoff into a voluntary leaving of her employment as of that date (Appeal
Board 208,326; 209,623-A).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

disqualification at the time of layoff, claimant had a definite date to return
to her employment and did not return to work on September 8, 1981, as directed.
Her relocation from the Bronx to Suffolk County was a matter of personal
preference and not for any compelling reason. Accordingly, we conclude that she
voluntarily left her employment without good cause effective September 8, 1981.
Claimant was entitled to all of the benefits she received until that date.
While she was overpaid $75 in benefits thereafter, such overpayment is
non-recoverable. Claimant made no false statement in connection with her claim
for benefits. Her statement on July 2, 1981 as to the loss of her last job was
true and correct. (See Matter of Valvo, appellate Division, Third Department
decided December 4, 1981).</span></p>

the inclusion of a teacher’s name on the list from which substitutes are called

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

which was stated in the initial determination of the local office, or July 6,
1981, the date adopted by the administrative law judge and by the Board in its

successive academic years or terms, or during a similar period between two
regular but not successive terms when the contract provides therefore
instead,&nbsp;<u>provided the claimant has a contract</u>&nbsp;to
perform,&nbsp;<u>or there is a reasonable assurance</u>&nbsp;that the claimant
will perform, services in such capacity for any such institution or
institutions for both of such academic years or such terms…&quot; (emphasis
supplied)</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We read the statute to impose two
pre-conditions to its application. The first pre-condition is that the claimant
have a contract&nbsp;<u>or</u>&nbsp;that there be a reasonable assurance of
claimant’s employment as a teacher during the next year or term. The second
pre-condition is that the period of any ineligibility occur &quot;during the
period between&quot; two academic years or terms. The statute provides that
such ineligibility is applicable &quot;<u>to any week commencing</u>&quot;
during the period between terms. In this state, &quot;week&quot; is statutorily
defined as the seven consecutive days beginning with Monday (Labor Law, Section
519). Thus, in our view, Section 590.10 of the Law should be made effective as
of the Monday which follows the date on which both pre-conditions have been
satisfied. In the event that the pre-conditions are met on a Monday, that will
be the effective date. In this case, the school year ended on June 19, 1981.
The reasonable assurance was created by the notice dated Tuesday, June 30,
1981. The first Monday after both of those dates is July 6, 1981. Accordingly,
that is the effective date of the claimant’s ineligibility which
continues&nbsp;<u>between</u>&nbsp;the academic years or terms. When the school
reopens in the Fall, the claimant becomes eligible for unemployment insurance
benefits, provided she has complied with the other provisions of the Law (see,
for example, Appeal Board 317,196).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Industrial Commissioner’s
application suggests that our interpretation may not be in conformity with the
Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Our reading of the Draft Language and Commentary
to Implement the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 (P.L. 94-566)
leads us to believe that our view is in conformity with federal requirements.
In the question and answer supplements to that publication, the Federal
Department of Labor acknowledges that state definitions of &quot;week&quot; may
vary. In Supplement 5, Question 1, when dealing with the application of these provisions
during vacation periods, the U.S. Department of Labor acknowledges that for
some vacations, claimants may be eligible for benefits at the beginning of the
vacation, while being found subject to the provisions of the statute during the
latter part of the period, simply because of the definition of &quot;week
commencing&quot;. Furthermore, in Supplement 1, Question 6, the federal
interpretations seems to coincide with our interpretation of pre-conditions
that the period be &quot;between terms&quot; and that the reasonable assurance
have arisen before the claimant be ruled ineligible to receive benefits. Since
we find no basis in the federal commentaries or elsewhere to support the
current position of the Industrial Commissioner that the claimant must be ruled
ineligible effective the Monday prior to the occurrence of the two
pre-conditions, we reject this contention.</span></p>

was employed by a school district for over 10 years as a bus driver-mechanic.
She is a member of a union in contractual relations with the employer. While
school was in session claimant usually worked five hours a day as a driver and
three hours a day as a mechanic. When school was not in session, including the summer,
she worked as a full-time mechanic.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>By letter dated April 15, 1981, the
employer notified her that effective at the end of the school term her position
as a driver mechanic was terminated, but that she was still being employed as a
driver for the 1981-82 school year. The change in jobs will result in a
decrease in salary from over $12,000 a year to about $7,000. Claimant has
subsequently expressed her intention to return to work as a driver.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that claimant worked in a non-instructional
capacity for a school district during the 1980-81 school year and was given a
non-instructional assignment for the 1981-82 school year, which she accepted.
Thus claimant has a contract to perform non-instructional services during the
next academic year. In such circumstances, the Court of Appeals has stated:
&quot;…what is required is to establish that an employee of one academic year
will be continued in employment by the educational institution in the following
academic year.&quot; (<u>Matter of LaMountain</u>, 51 NY 2d 318, at 331).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although claimant’s specific job
title was changed and her salary was lowered appreciably, this does not affect
the result because her past and future employment was an will be
non-instructional. The Board has previously held that under Section 590.10 of
the Law, which has similar language with respect continuing services in such
capacity as the previous academic year or term, there is no requirement that
the employment in the next year be equivalent to that in the prior year, so
long as it is instructional in both years. (Appeal Board 281,740 and 298,564).
We conclude that the same result is required under Section 590.11 with respect
to non-instructional employment and that claimant is ineligible to receive
benefits during the summer recess.</span></p>

that he would be on call during the period of the layoff. Claimant was entitled
to two weeks vacation. He then requested and received an advance payment of his
entire vacation pay for the year. Claimant subsequently was recalled and worked
for three days during the week of January 5, and four days during the week of
January 12,1981. He was paid for this seven days of work, apart from the
advanced vacation pay. Claimant then resumed work regularly until November 22,
1981 when the employer had a general shutdown of the plant. Prior to the said
shutdown, claimant did not request any particular vacation time from his
employer. On November 19, 1981 the employer posted a notice that the entire

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
claimant was employed in various capacities by a school district for
approximately seven years. She worked during the 1980-81 school year. She
resigned her employment effective April 15, 1981. The collective bargaining
agreement in effect between the claimant’s union and her employer sets forth a
formula to determine vacation pay during the summer. Since the claimant did not
work a full school year, the employer utilized (sic) another formula, set forth
in its by-laws to determine claimant’s vacation. The collective bargaining
agreement provides that the employer’s by-laws shall continue in full force and
effect. On June 19, 1981, the claimant received $2,939.98 as her total accrued
vacation pay for the period beginning the day after the close of school, June
27, 1981, and continuing for 43 days through August 9, 1981.</span></p>

credible evidence establishes that the formula, used by the employer to
determine the claimant’s vacation period as June 27 through August 9, 1981, was
in the by-laws and was incorporated, by references into the collective

constitutes a designated paid vacation period. Since the claimant received this
vacation pay prior to the end of the vacation period we conclude that no
benefits shall be payable to the claimant for any day during this paid vacation
period from June 27 through August 9, 1981. (Labor Law Section 591.3).</span></p>

employer refused this union recognition, it called a strike effective August
27, 1981. All of the employees who went on strike were replaced. On September
2, 1981, the striking employees were notified that they were discharged for
engaging in an unlawful strike, because ten days’ written notice of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant, Grace Valvo, is employed
by Tambe Oil, which delivers heating oil to homes and a few businesses during
the winter months. From Late Spring to early Fall it is dormant. The
corporation is owned and operated by Anthony Tambe, the father-in-law of one of
the claimant’s close friends. Mr. Tambe was formerly employed as a truck
driver. He went into business for himself in September 1976. The business
presently consists of a truck and a garage with a small office in the garage.
The owner personally delivers the oil, and in the beginning also attended to
the clerical matters. However, he had so much difficulty balancing his checking
account that his credit rating was soon impaired and he was on the verge of going
out of business. When he mentioned this to his daughter in claimant’s presence,
claimant volunteered to help. From October 1976 to November 1977 claimant wrote
his checks and balanced the checkbook as a favor, without compensation. During
this period she was receiving unemployment benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In November 1977 Mr. Tambe hired
claimant as a secretary to write checks, send out the bills, record all
financial transactions and answer the phone at the office. During the summer
months in 1978 and 1979 she was officially laid off and collected unemployment
benefits. However, if a bill had to be paid for monthly utilities or
outstanding loans Mr. Tambe would call claimant and ask her to write a check.
He would then pick it up at her home, sign it and mail it. Claimant received no
compensation for these services.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In June 1980 the agency informed
claimant that her uncompensated check writing activities constituted employment
under the Labor Law,&nbsp;<b><u>2</u></b>/ that she had therefore made false
statements when she claimed to be unemployed during the off-season, and also
during the period she wrote the company’s checks on a volunteer basis before
she was hired in November 1977. It further concluded that the statement had
been wilfully made and that claimant should therefore be penalized by
forfeiting 664 days of future eligibility and must also repay all benefits
received in the amount of $6,019.</span></p>

was held in July 1980. After the hearing the administrative law judge concluded
that the initial determination assessing a penalty and requiring repayment of
benefits should be set aside primarily because there was no evidence of fraud
or wilful misrepresentation on claimant’s part. He stated:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;While
claimant did perform check writing functions for this employer during the
period prior to the time she went on the payroll in November of 1977 and also
during the off season in 1978, claimant could reasonably have believed that
there was no employer/employee relationship since she was not reporting to the
employer’s establishment during the periods when she was writing such checks
and she was performing no other services. This is especially the case in the
period prior to her going on the payroll in November of 1977. With respect to
the off season of 1978, claimant’s activities were so substantially different from
her regular work assignments that even here she could reasonably have believed
that she was not performing as an employee…. In addition, she was clearly not
self-employed and since the amount of time required to write the checks was
minimal the activity or writing the checks as such did not establish a lack of
total unemployment.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Appeal Board reversed the
decision of the administrative law judge and reinstated the initial
determination. The Board summarily concluded that claimant’s weekly certifications
of unemployment &quot;were false and were known by her to be false when
made&quot; and therefore constituted wilful misrepresentations. The Board also
found that claimant’s statements were false in fact because &quot;claimant
performed substantial services for her employer of a similar nature to those
she performed when concededly in employment&quot;.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

alternative the agency urged that pursuant to Labor Law §597, subd 3 and 4, it
could recover a portion of the benefits (i.e. those paid during the year

modified by reversing that portion of the determination which imposed the
penalty and ordered repayment of benefits. The court accepted the Board’s
determination that claimant’s check writing activities constituted employment
but found nothing in the record to support the Board’s determination of
wilfulness. With respect to the Board’s right to recover a portion of the
benefits pursuant to Labor Law §597 subd. 3 and 4, on the theory that she made
a false statement the court held that &quot;the term ‘false statement’ in the
statute refers to a false factual statement&quot; and not to an erroneous
conclusion of law. In this case the court found that &quot;the requirement that
claimant weekly ‘report and certify as to his employment’ [12 NYCRR 473.2(a)]
obligated claimant to draw a legal conclusion – whether her uncompensated check
writing activities constituted employment within the meaning of the labor Law –
rather than provide factual data&quot;. The court distinguished our recent
decision in Matter of Maguire (Ross) (54 NY 2d 965) on the ground that the
petitioner’s activities in that case obviously constituted employment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In March 1978, claimant Debra Loll,
was laid off from her job as a clerk cashier at Stop &amp; Go in Elmira. She
was rehired in September of that year. In the interim she collected
unemployment benefits. At an unemployment interview on July 7, 1978 she had
stated that she occasionally helped out at her father’s drug store, but
received no compensation for these services. Toward the end of the month the
agency sent her a letter warning her that any services performed for her father
at his store would constitute employment even if she did not receive any
compensation. On August 8, the manager of the unemployment office who was a
regular customer at the drug store saw the claimant behind the counter.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In October the agency made an
initial determination that petitioner was ineligible to receive benefits for
two days out of each week during the period of claimed unemployment,
representing the days she helped her family at the drug store. Her weekly
certifications of unemployment were characterized as false and wilful
misrepresentations. As a result claimant was penalized 96 effective days and
was directed to repay $564 representing the benefits she received on the days
she was employed as her father’s drug store.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant demanded a hearing which
was held in February of 1979. At the hearing she testified that she went to her
father’s store nearly every days during the period she claimed unemployment, so
that she could borrow his car or have a family member baby sit for her three
year old son while she looked for a job. On occasion she would take care of a
customer or deliver a prescription if her father or brother were busy or wanted
to take a break. She usually only helped out a for a few minutes one or two
days a week during the evening or on a Saturday and on rare occasions worked
for a few hours. These activities ceased after being warned of the consequences
in July. However, she continued her daytime visits and during one of them might
have assisted her family at the store for a few minutes because she had done so
automatically throughout her life. She received no compensation for the help
she provided at the store.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>At the conclusion of the hearing the
administrative law judge held that claimant’s activities at her father’s store
constituted employment. He also stated that &quot;the record is clear that the
claimant was not candid with the local office and did not advise them of her
activities&quot;. Thus, he sustained the initial determinations. The Appeal
Board affirmed adopting both the findings of fact and opinion of the
administrative law judge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>From 1974 to 1977 claimant
Josephine Polvino was intermittently employed by a small construction company
owned and operated by her two sons, one of whom resides at home with his
parents. The company does general construction work but specializes in paving
driveways in the summer and removing snow in the winter. The company’s office
is located in a trailer on property where the equipment is stored. However,
company business is frequently conducted at claimant’s residence.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant performed clerical duties
at the office of a general and unskilled nature including answering phones,
writing checks and keeping some company records. She was laid off and collected
unemployment benefits on several occasions: March 4 to July 14, 1974; December
23, 1974 to June 13, 1976 and August 8, 1977 to May 14, 1978. According to
claimant and her sons this was due to a lack of work. However during these
periods she continued on occasion to answer phone calls from customers, write
checks and keep some records at her residence without compensation.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In March of 1979 the agency sent
claimant a notice of initial determination stating that she had been found to
be ineligible for unemployment benefits during the periods of claimed
unemployment listed above because she had continued to perform &quot;services
for Polvino Construction Corporation&quot;. She was directed to make repayment
in the amount of $8,834. The agency also imposed a penalty of 208 effective
days for wilful misrepresentation &quot;because you failed to divulge your
association and activities for Polvino Construction Company&quot;.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant demanded a hearing at the
conclusion of which the administrative law judge sustained the initial
determination. He noted that claimant had been employed by her sons’ company
where the services she performed were somewhat vague. He stated:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;In a
situation where a claimant is employed by a closely held corporation whose
principal officers and shareholders are related to her, the closest scrutiny
must be given to a claim for benefits. In the instant case the pattern of her
claims over several years makes it appear obvious that the employer controlled
her periods of employment. Because of the control exercised over the periods of
her employment, the undersigned cannot accept claimant’s eligibility for
benefits during these several periods when, by her own admission, claimant
performed some services for the corporation.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>That decision was in turn affirmed
by the Appeal Board which adopted the findings of fact and opinion of the
administrative law judge.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Appellate Division modified the
agency’s determination by reversing the penalty and repayment provisions. In
its memorandum the court held that there was substantial evidence to support
the Board’s determination that petitioner was unavailable for employment. The
court also found no &quot;reason for disturbing the Board’s determination that
claimant was totally unemployed&quot;. The court then stated:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&quot;We
are of the opinion, however, that there is insufficient evidence to support the
Board’s determination on the issue of wilful misrepresentation. Claimant’s
activities did not obviously constitute employment as the situation was found
to be in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Maguire (Ross)</u>&nbsp;[___NY 2<sup>nd</sup>___(Oct.
27, 1981]). Although claimant may be found to have been employed in the
technical sense of the Labor Law there is no evidence of wilfullness in her
certifications to total unemployment on her weekly reports. Consequently, the
imposition of a forfeiture of effective days and the recovery of overpayments
pursuant to section 594 of the Labor Law are not warranted in the present case
[see,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Valvo (Ross)</u>, supra;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Smalt (Ross)</u>&nbsp;___AD2d___
(June 11, 1981)]. In addition, under the circumstances presented herein, there
may be no recovery of a portion of the benefits pursuant to Section 597 (subd.
4) of the Labor Law [see&nbsp;<u>Matter of Valvo (Ross)</u>, supra].&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The order of the Appellate Division
should be affirmed in the first case (<u>Valvo</u>) and reversed in the other
two (<u>Loll</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Polvino</u>).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Initially, we note that at this
stage no one challenges the agency’s determination that the petitioners’
activities technically constitute employment within the meaning of the statute.
The appeals are limited to the following issues: (1) did the petitioners make
false statements when they stated that they were unemployed and (2) did they
act wilfully. In addition the agency concedes that in order to sustain a
finding of wilfulness the evidence must show that the petitioners knew that
their actions constituted employment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The problem is that the agency’s
interpretation of the statute defining employment (Labor Law 522) although
rational, does not reflect the common understanding of employment. As a result
laymen, particularly unskilled laymen who undoubtedly represent the majority of
claimants for unemployment benefits, may not realize that occasionally helping
a friend or relative may constitute employment even though they are not paid
for it. The agency claims that its information booklet provides a kind of
constructive notice when it states: &quot;You are considered employed on any
day when you work – even an hour or less – in self-employment, or a freelance
basis, or for someone else. It makes no difference whether…you get paid for
that day&quot;. The agency, however, has omitted the next sentence, which
states: &quot;For example, work on a straight commission basis is employment
even though you may not receive the commission until sometime later or make no
sale at all&quot;. This gloss leaves the impression that the term employment
includes activities that are generally perceived as employment regardless of
the technicalities.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The agency is on firmer ground when
it relies on the facts of the particular case. In the Polvino case, for instance,
where the claimant worked for her sons, the evidence shows that she performed
essentially the same limited services while allegedly unemployed as she did
while allegedly employed. The only significant difference is that she received
unemployment benefits instead of wages. In addition, as the agency notes, her
periods of unemployment were never satisfactorily explained. It was appropriate
for the agency to closely scrutinize this situation as it did, because of the
possibility that the periods of employment and unemployment were manipulated in
order to claim unemployment benefits. Under the circumstances the agency could
conclude that if she understood that the services she performed for her sons
constituted employment when she was on their payroll, she also realized that
they constituted employment when she was technically laid off.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The&nbsp;<u>Loll</u>&nbsp;case
presents a more sympathetic situation but nevertheless there is substantial
evidence to sustain the agency’s finding that she acted wilfully. The evidence
shows that she was warned that her services at her father’s drug store
constituted employment. When, despite this warning, she was later observed
behind the counter, the agency could reasonably infer that her activities
throughout the period were not the result of ignorance of the law. Notably in
this case she was not required to repay all benefits received but only those
relating to the days on which she was actually working at the store.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In the&nbsp;<u>Valvo</u>&nbsp;case,
on the other hand, there is nothing in the record from which it can be
reasonably inferred that she realized that her writing of a few monthly checks
during a long period of seasonal unemployment would constitute employment
disqualifying her from all benefits throughout the entire period. Although she
worked for the father-in-law of a close friend, there is no suggestion that her
employment was not legitimate and the obvious seasonal nature of the business
and genuine lack of work during the period of claimed unemployment is
undisputed. Thus, the agency’s finding of wilfullness was arbitrary.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>With respect to the agency’s
alternative argument that claimant Valvo should be required to repay a portion
of the benefits for making a false statement within the meaning of Labor Law
§597 subd. 4, the Appellate Division correctly held that the statute only
applies to false statements of fact and that petitioner’s certification of
unemployment represented an error of law. This does not mean, as the agency
suggests, that wilful misrepresentation is now required under this section and
section 594 thus rendering one of the sections meaningless. It should be clear
from the Appellate Division’s decision that section 597 permits recovery of
benefits received within the past year when the claimant has made a false
statement of fact even though unintended. However, when claimant has in good
faith received benefits to which he or she was not entitled because of a
mistake of law on the part of the claimant or the agency, none of the benefits
may be recovered. This interpretation is required by the wording of the
statute, and supported by its legislative history, which shows that it was
designed to provide relief to claimants when an overpayment or erroneous
payment of benefits resulted from an honest mistake, and to preclude all recovery
when the claimant was not in any way responsible for the error (see e.g.,
Industrial Comm. Memorandum of April 9, 1942 on Assembly Int. No. 1804, Print
No. 2455).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Accordingly, the order of the
Appellate Division should be affirmed in Matter of&nbsp;<u>Valvo</u>, and
reversed in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Loll</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Matter of Polvino</u>.
In the latter two cases the determination of the Appeal Board should be
reinstated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal by the Industrial
Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed
March 27, 1981, which determined that claimant was eligible to receive
unemployment insurance benefits effective December 11, 1980. Claimant, a
carpenter for a construction company, last worked on December 10, 1980,
following which date, at his employer’s instructions, he telephoned every day
to inquire whether his employer, whose business in the month preceding had
become increasingly sluggish, had work for him. Each time he was informed that
no work was available. On December 29, 1980, after claimant told his employer
he was experiencing severe financial problems, the employer informed claimant
that he was laid off, that he should apply for unemployment insurance benefits
and state he had been laid off on December 10, the last day he actually worked.
Claimant did so immediately, but because he had not filed his claim until
December 29, the Industrial Commissioner declared him ineligible to receive
benefits for the period from December 11 through December 28, 1980 [see 12
NYCRR 473.1(a), (h)]. The administrative law judge’s decision overruling the
commissioner and concluding that claimant’s neglect to file was due to
misinformation given him by his employer and, therefore, his failure to timely
register for benefits was excusable, was concurred in by the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board. &quot;Whether or not good cause exists for a claimant'’
failure to comply with registration and reporting requirements is an issue of
fact within the province of the board&quot; [<u>Matter of Condon</u>&nbsp;(<u>Levine</u>),
51 A.D. 2d 1070, 1071]. Mistaken reliance on an employer’s misrepresentations
may constitute good cause excusing failure to register for benefits in
accordance with the commissioner’s regulations [<u>Matter of Beck</u>&nbsp;(<u>Ross</u>),
72 A.D. 2d 867]. Here, there was uncontradicted testimony that claimant, who
had no prior experience with the unemployment insurance system was not simply
relying upon his own impressions during the period in question, but instead was
misled by his employer into believing he could not file before he was
officially laid off and that until then he was ineligible for benefits. As
there is substantial evidence to support the Board’s determination, an
affirmance is required. Decision affirmed, without costs. Main, J.P., Mikoll,
Yesawich, Jr., Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal from a decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed February 1, 1982, which disqualified
claimant from receiving benefits because she voluntarily left her employment
without good cause. Claimant has been a tax service representative for the
Internal Revenue Service for four years, working on a seasonal basis primarily
during the peak January through April periods. On July 8, 1981, she volunteered
to be furloughed under the terms of a union contract, and when she left, she
was given no specific date of return. A recent amendment to section 593
[subd.1, par. (a)] of the Labor Law (L 1981, ch. 234, §1, eff. June 15, 1981),
provides an exception to the disqualification for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause &quot;if the claimant, pursuant to an option
provided under a collective bargaining agreement or written employer plan which
permits waiver of his right to retain the employment when there is a temporary
layoff because of lack of work, has elected to be separated for a temporary
period and the employer has consented thereto&quot;. The appeal board, in
interpreting this statute in the instant case, required an agreement between
employer and employee as to the duration of the temporary layoff. Claimant
contests this interpretation. It is well settled that appellate courts must
accept the board’s construction and application of terms in the Unemployment
Insurance Law if that construction has a rational basis [<u>Matter of Marsh</u>&nbsp;(<u>Catherwood</u>),
23 NY 2d 235, 239;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Newman</u>&nbsp;(<u>Catherwood</u>), 24 AD
2d 1042]. The Board’s interpretation of section 593 [subd.1, par. (a)] of the
Labor Law does have a rational basis. Although claimant argues that the
requirement that a layoff be &quot;for a temporary period and the employer has
consented thereto&quot; should be construed to mean either any non-permanent
employee termination or any termination which, due to the employer’s past
practices, impliedly is temporary, it is at least an equally reasonable
construction of the statutory language to require an explicit agreement between
the employer and the employee at the time of the layoff as to the length of the
temporary separation. Both the Governor’s memorandum of approval and the Deputy
Industrial Commissioner for Legal Affairs’ letter to the Governor’s counsel
prior to approval stated that the amendment would be limited to situations
where &quot;the duration of the layoff is fixed by agreement&quot;.
Additionally, in establishing guidelines to carry out this statute, the
Industrial Commissioner, in Field Memorandum No. 4-81, interpreted the
amendment to have six essential elements for applicability, the last being that
&quot;(t)he separation is for a temporary period whose length is agreed to by
the employer and the claimant&quot;. Thus, the appeal board’s construction is
supported by the language of the statute, documents reflecting its legislative
history, and the interpretation given the statute by the agency responsible for
its administration. Its construction is not irrational or unreasonable and
should be upheld [<u>Matter of Marsh</u>&nbsp;(<u>Catherwood</u>), 13 NY 2d
235, 239, supra; see also,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Howard v. Wyman</u>, 28 NY 2d 434,
438]. Furthermore, substantial evidence in the record supports the Board’s
determination that no agreement existed between claimant and her employer
regarding the length of her furlough. True, claimant and the employer did
testify at the hearing as to an unspoken understanding based on the employer’s
past practice, that claimant would return in the fall or, at the least, by the
beginning of January. However, at the time claimant stopped working, she
clearly was not given any specific date for recall, and when the employer
filled out an unemployment insurance form for claimant, he stated that no
length of layoff was agreed to and that the length of her layoff was
&quot;indefinite&quot;. Decision affirmed, without costs. Main, J.P., Mikoll,
Yesawich,Jr., Weiss and Levine, JJ., concur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal from a decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed May 29, 1981, which reversed the
decision of the administrative law judge and overruled an initial determination
of the Commissioner of Labor which ruled claimant ineligible for benefits
effective June 16, 1980. Claimant was employed as an adjunct assistant
professor for the entire 1979-1980 academic year at New York University where
she had been employed since 1968. During the same academic year, claimant had
also taught a course or two at Touro and Staten Island Colleges on a limited
part-time basis. In March of 1980, through a memorandum of employment, claimant
was advised by New York University that her employment was available to her for
the 1980-1981 academic year and would commence on September 22, 1980. Claimant
concedes receipt of the memorandum and she responded by ordering the textbooks
she intended to use through the university library. Claimant also applied for
and was granted a position as a part time teacher in the abbreviated summer
school session running from June 9 through July 23. Contending that she was not
between two successive academic years but rather was in &quot;the middle of an
academic term&quot; during which she had only partial employment, claimant
filed for benefits by certifying as to partial unemployment from June 16
through July 27. The Board found that claimant was &quot;not between academic
terms&quot; while teaching par-time two days a week during the five-week summer
session and was, therefore, eligible for partial benefits. We disagree. While
great weight is to be accorded to the construction given statutes by the
agencies responsible for their administration and, if not irrational or
unreasonable, that construction should be upheld (<u>Matter of Howard v Wyman</u>,
28 NY 2d 434), the issue presented, involving the interpretation of statutory
language, is a question more appropriate for judicial rather than
administrative resolution [<u>Matter of Van Teslar</u>&nbsp;(<u>Levine</u>), 35
NY 2d 311;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Theurer (Trustees of Columbia Univ. in City of
N.Y. – Ross)</u>, 59 AD 2d 196]. Subdivision 10 of Section 590 of the Labor Law
provides in substance that as to one employed in an instructional capacity, his
or her weeks of employment and remuneration therefor shall be disregarded in
determining his or her eligibility for benefits during the period between
academic years or terms provided the claimant has a contract to complete or has
reasonable assurance or continued employment. Claimant concededly has that
assurance and we have held on numerous occasions that one so situated is not
entitled to benefits [see&nbsp;<u>Matter of Gaeta</u>&nbsp;(<u>Ross</u>), 78 AD
2d 742, motion for leave to appeal denied 52 NY 2d 703]. The Board’s holding
that because claimant chose to teach two days a week during a five-week summer
session she was &quot;not between academic terms&quot; and, therefore,
eligible, is both irrational and unreasonable and thwarts the clear legislative
intent. The law was enacted for the benefit of teachers whose employment had
terminated at the conclusion of the academic year and whose employment
prospects for the ensuing academic year were doubtful. It surely was not
enacted to supplement the income of a regularly employed teacher who chose to
each a few days during her regular summer vacation while awaiting the
commencement of the next academic year for which she had unquestioned assurance
of employment. Since the question is purely one of statutory reading and
analysis, dependent only upon an accurate apprehension of legislative intent,
and since the Board’s decision frustrates that clear intent and is irrational
and unreasonable, it must be reversed (cf.&nbsp;<u>Matter of Kurcsics v
Merchants Mut. Ins. Co.</u>, 49 NY 2d 451). Decision reversed, without costs,
and initial determination of Commissioner of Labor reinstated. Sweeney, J.P.,
Main, Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., and Levine, JJ., concur.</span></p>

was employed as a mental hygiene therapy aide until he was suspended from work

action. Effective October 1, 1979, he filed an original claim for benefits and
a benefit rate of $120 per week was established. Claimant did not receive
unemployment insurance benefits for the statutory week October 1, 1979 through
October 7, 1979, as this was his waiting week. Thereafter, he received a full
benefit check for each statutory week from the statutory week ending October 14
through the statutory week ending November 18, 1979, totaling $720.</span></p>

reinstatement with no loss of pay beginning October 20, 1979. Claimant reported
back to work on the following Monday.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On February 25,1980, the employer,
anticipating a recoverable overpayment determination being issued against the
claimant, forwarded $480 to the local office as repayment of the possible
overpayment. The balance of the back pay was forwarded to the claimant. On
March 5, 1980, the local office issued an initial determination holding that he
was not totally unemployed and charging him with a recoverable overpayment of
$540 based upon claimant’s back pay award. The total office accepted the
employer’s partial payment.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the claimant and the employer entered into
an agreement providing for the claimant to receive his back pay as of October
20, 1979. The decision of the Appellate Division (<u>Matter of Minnie Cohen</u>,
44 AD 2d 286, affirming appeal Board 178,824) is not applicable in this case.
In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Cohen</u>, the arbitrator determined that the claimant was
entitled to damages for wrongful discharge. He determined the&nbsp;<u>amount of
damages</u>&nbsp;by reducing the amount of the lost income by the amount of
income from collateral sources, including unemployment insurance benefits and
income from another job. It was this amount that the employer paid to that
claimant. In the instant case, the claimant was entitled to his full back pay
for the specified period and it was not damages for wrongful discharge. The
agreement did not provide for any reduction for unemployment insurance benefits
received, but rather required the employer to pay, out of the proceeds of the
salary an obligation of the claimant. The employer was thereby acting as an
agent for the claimant. Accordingly, we find that the claimant was not totally
unemployed during the period in issue because he received his back pay. Since
the award covers two days in the statutory week ending October 21, 1979, one
half of the benefits which claimant received for that week constitute an
overpayment. The claimant was also overpaid for the four weeks of full benefits
received thereafter. This totals $540 in benefits. We conclude that the
claimant is obligated to repay the entire amount of the overpayment since it is
a retroactive payment of remuneration. Since $480 was paid by the employer,
acting as an agent for the claimant, there remains an outstanding balance of
$60 due from the claimant.</span></p>

Accordingly, in a case such as this, the employee's right to immunity as a

that claimant's dismissal was not related to the exercise of his constitutional
rights but, rather, was a result of his refusal to perform a duty of his public
employment. In fact, it is uncontroverted that in refusing to cooperate,
claimant disregarded the advice of his union and violated the terms of his
collective bargaining agreement. Under these circumstances, the board could
properly conclude that claimant's refusal to cooperate rose to the level of
misconduct in connection with his employment (cf.&nbsp;<u>Dolan v. Kelly.

a high school. Claimants J.L., L.J. and M.D. were full time elementary school
teachers. Claimant H.H. was a full time driver education teacher at the high
school. All were laid off as of June 19, 1981, the close of the 1980-8l school
year, due to a reduction in force.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In early June, 1981, all of the
school district's principals submitted their 1980-81 substitute teacher lists
to the central office. The central business office then compiled a list of all
substitutes who had been available to teach in the 1990-81 school year. To that
master list it added the names of the laid off teachers, including the
claimants herein. On June 19, 1981, the central business office sent to each
person on that list, including the claimants, a letter which stated, in part:
&quot;...we are placing you on our active substitute list for the 1981-82
school year.&quot; Each claimant received a copy of this letter.</span></p>

maintain a system wide active substitute list. The principal of the elementary

call teachers. These substitute lists for the 1981-82 school year were compiled
by each principal shortly before or after the beginning of the 1981-82 school
year on September 3, 1981. At a meeting of all the principals and the district
superintendent on August 24, 1981, the principals were requested to add the
names of the laid off teachers to their substitute lists. The central office,
however, did not provide the principals with copies of its master list of
substitutes, nor did it thereafter attempt to verify that the names of the laid
off teachers had been added to the individual lists of the respective schools.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The principal of the H.P.
Elementary School compiled his list of substitute teachers on August 27, 1982
and the names of J.L. and L.J. were included on it. The principal inadvertently
omitted M.D.'s name. M.D.'s name was also inadvertently omitted from the list
of the B. Elementary School, which was compiled a few days later by that
principal. The list for the W.F. Elementary School was not compiled until the
second week of the 1981-82 term and, for the first time, M.D.'s name was
included on that list by that school's principal. The name of no claimant
herein appeared on the list of the middle school until J.L. requested that her
name be included on it in September, 1981. H.H. did the same in January, 1982.</span></p>

by the Employment Service from the Teachers Registry which it compiles. In
order to be included on the Employment Service list, a teacher must request
that his name be added to it. The high school can request that the Employment
Service add particular names to its list, but the Employment Service will not
do so until it notifies the teachers in question and receives their consent to
their inclusion on the list. Because H.H. had received the letter from the
central office stating that he was being placed on its active substitute list,
he was unaware that he had to notify the Employment Service to be included on
the high school substitute list. He first became aware of this requirement when
he heard the testimony of an employee of the Employment Service which was taken
at the hearing before the administrative law judge on September 14, 1981. H.H.
then took immediate steps to have his name placed on the list. The high school
did not request his inclusion on the list until early October, 1981.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION:</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;The
Board has previously held that a claimant has a reasonable assurance of
employment in an instructional capacity during the next academic term when he
is informed by the employer that his name is being placed on the list from
which substitutes are called to teach. The reasonable assurance is established
by the presence of the claimant's name on said list (Appeal Board 275,301;
313,883; and 320,200). The credible evidence now before the Board establishes
that the employer's letter of June 19, 1982, which purportedly advised
claimants of their inclusion on the employer's active substitute list, did not
provide them with a reasonable assurance of employment in the 1981-82 term. To
the contrary, the master list compiled by the central office and referred to in
its letter had no relation to the actual substitute lists from which substitute
teachers were called by the principals or by the Employment Service. Its lack
of relationship of the actual active substitute lists is evidenced by the fact
that the central office neither provided the principals nor the Employment
Service with its master list of available substitutes nor did it verify that
the names of the teachers to whom it had sent the letter were ever placed on
any school's list resulting in the failure to include M.D's name on two and
L.J's on one of the three lists from which they were most likely to be called.
The letter, far from providing a reasonable assurance of employment, misled the
claimants to the manner in which substitutes were called. This is especially
true in the case of H.H. because he was not advised that he must himself take
the initiative to have his name placed on a high school list maintained by the
employment Service.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The present cases are similar
to&nbsp;<u>Matter of Maass</u>&nbsp;(77 Ad 2d 765, rev'g A.B. 298,259).
In&nbsp;<u>Maass</u>, the Court held that where the list on which the
claimant's name was placed was not a source of employment, the employer's
letter advising her of such placement on the list did not constitute a
reasonable assurance of employment. While the nature of the teaching employment
in&nbsp;<u>Maass</u>&nbsp;was different from that present here, the
circumstances of the notification to claimants that they were being placed on a
list which was not, in fact, the source of employment was the same.
Accordingly, we conclude that the employer's letter of June 19, 1981 did not
provide claimants with a reasonable assurance of employment during the 1981-82
term.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We further conclude that there was
no reasonable assurance of employment until such time as the names of each
claimant were actually placed on at least one of the substitute lists which
would eventually be used. Inasmuch as the employer refused to produce the
middle school list or have its principal testify, we must infer that none of
the claimants were included on it. Thus J.L. and L.J. had a reasonable
assurance as of August 27, 1981, the date that the principal of H.P. Elementary
School compiled his list and included their names. Accordingly, they were
ineligible to receive benefits effective August 31, 1981, the Monday following
the day upon which there was a reasonable assurance of employment. Claimant
M.D. did not appear on any list until after the 1981-82 school year had began.
She was thus eligible to receive benefits during the entire summer recess. H.H.
was also entitled to have his weeks and earnings as a teacher considered during
the entire summer recess. His name did not appear on any list until after the
hearing before the administrative law judge on September 14, 1981.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We reject the employer's contention
that the Board and the administrative law judge exceeded their discretion by
directing the employer to produce certain witnesses and documents. Any reliance
on the State Administrative Procedure Act is inappropriate since this Board is
specifically excluded from its provisions. The conduct of our hearings is to be
governed by rules and regulations established by the Board (Labor Law, Section
622.1). We also note that there is no &quot;burden of proof&quot; in our

considered at the Board hearing are information which is relevant to the matter
in issue and we think that it was properly requested (Labor Law, Section
621.3). Since the employer and the Commissioner of Labor had contended that
Section 590.10 applied by reason of the June 19, 1981 letter, we determined it was
proper to consolidate these four cases (12 N.Y.C. R.R. 463.2 d). All of these

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: During
the 1981-82 school year, claimant was employed by a public school district as a
teaching assistant and regular substitute teacher. Originally, he was given an
appointment as a probationary teaching assistant and, after three years, he
would receive tenure in that position. The original appointment was for that
three-year period. He spent approximately equal time at each position during
the 1981-82 school year. As a teaching assistant, he took attendance,
maintained order in the classroom, made photocopies for the teacher, watered
the plants, and erased the blackboard. He was not permitted to teach or give
instruction to the students in the class. As a substitute teacher, he had full
responsibility for instructing students in the study of English, as a second
language.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>By letter dated June 3, 1982,
claimant was informed that the school district had no need for his services in
his current joint assignments for the following school year. The letter also
stated that, if he was interested in continuing as a teaching assistant, he
should contact the Associate For Personnel and Instruction. The letter
indicated that such a position would not prevent claimant from obtaining a
teaching job in the district or elsewhere. The letter concluded with the
observation that, in view of the claimant's quality teaching, the district
would be delighted to offer him teaching employment if a position became
available. In a memorandum dated June 23, 1982, the employer reminded the
claimant that he did, in fact, &quot;have a probationary appointment as a
teaching assistant and the district plans to continue your services in that
title unless you indicate that you are not interested in continuing.&quot; The
memo further stated that the district was planning on claimant's availability
as a teaching assistant. Subsequent memoranda advised the claimant that the
district still did not know if claimant intended to return to work. They
requested that he submit a resignation if he did not intend to return. They
also, indicated that formal action would be taken to remove claimant if he did
not report for duty on September 7,1982 and had not resigned. Claimant neither
resigned nor reported.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;The
credible evidence now before the Board establishes that half of the claimant's
employment with the school district was in a non-professional capacity. The
duties which he performed as a teaching assistant were not instructional in
nature. The record fails to establish that the duties of the offered full-time
position as a teaching assistant would be substantially different from those
performed by the claimant during the prior school year. Although the joint
position had been abolished, the memorandum of June 23, 1982 establishes that
the school district was continuing claimant's employment as a teaching
assistant under the probationary appointment. There were no substantial
preconditions to this continued employment. Under these circumstances, we find
that the claimant had an individual contract, within the meaning of Section
590.1 to perform non-instructional services for the following school year. Claimant's
silence does not change our result. A contract, may exist without a commitment
on the part of the employee (<u>Matter of La Mountain</u>, 51 NY 2d 318, at
331, aff'g 70 AD 2d 374, aff'g Appeal Board 276,250). Accordingly, the wages
which he received as a teaching assistant (one half of his total wages) cannot
be used by the claimant to establish a benefit rate during the summer.</span></p>

be used by the claimant to establish his benefit rate during the summer.</span></p>

a general laborer, was employed by a frozen foods company for approximately
eight months until April 24, 1982. During the course of his employment,
claimant's supervisor developed a pattern of reprimanding the claimant and
using profanities and foul language. The final incident occurred when the
claimant did maintenance work on some of the employer's equipment, a job which
the supervisor believed to be his own responsibility. In reprimanding the
claimant, his supervisor engaged in the same pattern of profanity which he had
previously used toward claimant during his employment. On at least two
occasions, claimant complained to the employer and requested to be moved to
another job. No action was taken by the employer. Claimant subsequently
resigned his employment because he was unable to tolerate the supervisor's
abusive language.</span></p>

credible evidence now before the Board establishes that the claimant resigned
his employment because he could not tolerate the abusive language directed
towards him by his supervisor. The fact that claimant remained in this
employment situation despite a developing pattern of abusive profanity, and
requested a transfer to another job indicates a valid effort to retain his
employment. However, the claimant was not obliged to continue to subject
himself to his supervisor's profanity and abuse in order to safeguard his
employment. Even if the employer's contentions were true, that claimant's
supervisor addresses all of his subordinates in a like manner, this does not
operate to deprive claimant of a valid basis for resigning his employment.
Accordingly, we conclude that claimant's separation from his employment
occurred under non-disqualifying conditions because he did have good cause to
resign his employment.</span></p>

school district that her position was eliminated because of a reduction in force.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant filed an original
claim for benefits effective September 7, 1981. A weekly benefit rate of $97
was established for her. During the first few weeks of the 1981-82 school year,
the claimant worked for several days as a per diem substitute school teacher.
Her rate of pay as a per diem school teacher was $36 per day. On September 24,
1981, the claimant was telephoned by the Teacher's Registry of the Employment
Service and was offered employment as a substitute teacher for that day. The
claimant refused the offer because the per diem salary of $36 was less than the
daily rate for her half-day of teaching during the previous school year. Later
that same day, for the same reason, the claimant refused an offer of employment
from the Registry to be a substitute teacher on the following day.</span></p>

advised the Registry that she was not available for work on that day. 0n
September 29, and 30, 1981, the claimant was again called by the Registry and
she refused offers of substitute teaching work because of the salary.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>According to a survey by the Board
of Cooperative Educational Services (B.O.C.E.S.) for the area, the per diem

not higher than, the rates paid by other school districts in the area.</span></p>

well established that the Board has continuing jurisdiction to reopen a case

mot for lv. to app den 45<u>&nbsp;</u>NY 2d 713, and&nbsp;<u>Matter of Mauskoff</u>&nbsp;(Ross),
79 AD 2d 790). Pursuant to that authority, we have determined to reopen this
case on our own motion.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence establishes
that claimant's employment history is primarily that of a permanent teacher. As
a permanent teacher, working only half time during the 1980-81 school year, she
earned $7,393. When claimant worked as a per diem substitute teacher for
several days during the first few weeks of the 1981-82 school year, she was
paid $36 per day. On September 24, 1981, the claimant was called by the
Teacher's Registry of the Employment Service and was offered employment as a
substitute teacher for that day. The claimant refused the offer because the per
diem salary was less than the daily rate for her half-day work during the
previous year. On September 28, 1981, and again on September 29, and 30, 1981,
the claimant was again called by the Registry and again she refused offers of
substitute teaching work because of the salary.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We must first consider whether or
not the pay for such work was substantially less favorable to claimant than the
wage prevailing for similar work in the locality. The B.O.C.E.S. survey lends
support to the conclusion that the salary offered for the per diem assignments
was not substantially less favorable to claimant than the wage prevailing in
the locality for similar work. Moreover, $36 exceeded claimant's benefit rate
for one effective day ($24.2)&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Scranton,&nbsp;</u>12 NY 2d
983, aff'g Appeal Board 79,057). Accordingly, we conclude that the offered
position did not pay substantially less than the prevailing wage.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>However, the question remains as to
whether or not the claimant is fitted by training and experience for per diem
work as a substitute teacher. In our prior decision in this case, we disagreed
with the initial determination of the local office which ruled that the
claimant had primarily worked as a permanent teacher in the last year and,
therefore, was not reasonably fitted by training and experience for per diem
work. The initial determination followed Field Memorandum 4-80 wherein the
Commissioner of Labor adopted the view that if, during the year preceding the
filing of an original claim, the claimant worked primarily as a permanent
teacher, such claimant is not fitted by training and experience for per diem
work as a substitute teacher.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>This Board has previously held the
view that the determining factor is not whether an individual is physically
able to perform a particular type of work. Many people can do entry-level jobs
or menial tasks. That does not require us to conclude that all of these people
are reasonably fitted by training and experience for such work. Work offered to
a claimant for unemployment insurance benefits must be reasonably suited to an
individual's skills and talents. The skills which this claimant has acquired
through years of study and actual experience as a regular teacher are very
different from the requirements for assignment to per diem work. She had been
required to make lesson plans and to chart the scholastic and psychological
developments of her students. A per diem substitute has no such
responsibilities. The higher standards required for a regular teacher are often
reflected in the higher salary, full benefit coverage and union representation
which a per diem substitute does not enjoy. While a full use of skills is not
required, there must be an attempt to match an individual's qualifications, in
an equitable manner, to the specifications of an available position.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We must also look to some of the
peculiar skills required in the offered position in a determination of its
suitability for this claimant. A per diem substitute is required to enter the
classroom, to maintain order conducive to the learning experience, and, Without
advance preparation, to follow the lesson plan established by the regular
teacher, all with children With whom he or she has had and probably Will have little
other contact. This points to two important definable characteristics required
of a per diem substitute teacher.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The first is the ability to
maintain order in the classroom. The probability of little future contact with
the pupils requires that the teacher possess skills and a presence which are
conducive to discipline. There can be little follow-up or enforcement of
decisions beyond the end of that particular day. The pupils are often unknown
to the per diem teacher when he or she enters the room. Assessments of the
emotional, psychological and social development of the individual child must be
on the spur of the moment and are deprived of the overview held by the regular
teacher who is required to engage in long range planning for the child's development
and growth in those areas. Having been a regular teacher, this claimant would
not have been required to develop such skills or presence. At most, they might
only have been helpful on the first, few days of a new school term.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The second distinguishing quality
required of a per diem substitute is the ability, without advance preparation,
to follow the lesson plan established by the regular teacher. Ideally, the
lesson plan has been developed to coordinate the skills and personality of the
regular teacher with the abilities and potentials of the students so as to
achieve a model learning situation. The per diem substitute has no opportunity
to review the plan before he or she is expected to implement it to the best of
his or her abilities. The plan is geared toward the educational techniques used
by the regular teacher, not necessarily by the substitute. The per diem teacher
may be unfamiliar with the topic being covered even if it is within the area of
his or her certification. On the other hand, this spontaneity is obviously not
required of the regular teacher and would not be compatible with the job
requirement that he or she plans lessons.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>While it may be easy to say that a
teacher is a teacher and that anyone can do the job of a per diem substitute, a
closer analysis of the roles of a regular teacher and of a per diem teacher
prevents such hasty conclusions. Upon review of the entire record and all of
the evidence, we are now disposed to conclude that the view set forth in the
aforementioned Field Memorandum 4-80 expresses a more equitable application of
the statute upon all of the circumstances. Accordingly, we determine that this
claimant who had been a regular teacher for several years, is not reasonably
fitted by training and experience to be a per diem substitute teacher. The fact
that she may have given the occupation of per diem teacher a reasonable trial
period for a few days at the start of the school year does not change the
conclusion. Accordingly, we conclude that claimant had good cause to refuse the
offered positions.</span></p>

     per diem substitute work would be with good cause and the claimant should
     not be held unavailable for failing to seek per diem substitute work.</span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Many
teachers have worked both as permanent and substitute teachers. Within the
class of substitute teachers are those who work on call (per diem) and those
hired for longer periods to replace permanent teachers on leave. A teacher who
has had a substantial amount of work as both a permanent and substitute in the
one year period preceding the initial claim is fitted by training and
experience for both kinds of teaching employment and may be subject to a denial
of benefits for refusing to accept or seek substitute work.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>When a
question of wages is raised by a claimant, local offices may not overlook the
relationship between benefit rate and net pay from offered employment. The
principle that there is good cause to refuse a job when the net pay plus
partial benefits is less than the benefit rate is applicable to teachers as
well as any other occupation (<u>Matter of Scranton</u>; A-750-1557). For
example, a teacher, with a benefit rate of $125, who refuses a one-day job
paying a net (take home) wage of $30, does so with good cause.</span></p>

that, as a condition of her continued employment, she was required to pass a
Civil Service examination to be given on Saturday, August 8, 1981. She filed
her application in time to take the examination. However, on the date the examination
was given, claimant attended the funeral of her husband's grandfather in
Florida and did not take the test. Consequently, claimant's name was not on the
civil service list that was promulgated. All the other provisional employees at
claimant's level in the department where she worked took the August 8, 1981
examination, and passed it. Each of these individuals was appointed to a

mechanics who held their appointments provisionally. Several months prior to
September, 1981, the municipality administered a civil service examination to
permanently fill those positions. The claimant did not apply to take the test.
In September, 1981, a civil service list was certified as a result of the
examination and permanent appointments were made to fill the positions.
Approximately 105 of the provisional appointees either did not take or pass the
examination. There was a total of about 200 candidates who did pass the test.
However, the list of passing candidates was exhausted before the end of
September, 1981, and many provisional appointees were retained. The department
had a choice as to which provisionals to retain. The claimant was not retained
because, although his performance evaluations were satisfactory, they were not
as good as the evaluations of the mechanics retained. The claimant's failure to
take the civil service examination did not influence the department's decision

approximately 15 years as a budget and fiscal analyst for the Human Resources
Administration of the City of New York when he was discharged effective April
29, 1981. The duties that his position entailed included reviewing and
developing budget proposals, formulating policies and procedures for funding of
community programs and monitoring grants and expenditures by his agency. His
termination was a consequence of certain incidents which led to his being
indicted, pursuant to l8 U.S.C.201 (subd. [b]), on 10 felony counts of bribing
a public official in connection with immigration matters while representing
aliens. Following a jury trial, he was ultimately convicted of 10 counts of the
lesser felony of knowingly giving gratuities to a public official in violation
of l8 U.S.C. 201 (subd. [f]) and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and
three years' probation. After he served 11 weeks in prison on these convictions
between August and November of 198O, he returned to work for the municipal
agency, which instituted administrative hearings, pursuant to section 75 of the
Civil Service Law, seeking his removal for misconduct. At the conclusion of
these hearings, the commissioner of the agency decided that claimant should be
dismissed from his position because he had been convicted of a Federal crime
involving moral turpitude, and claimant was informed of this decision by letter
dated April 29, 19S1. He subsequently filed an applicat1on for unemployment
insurance benefits, and it is the board's approval thereof which the employer
and the Commissioner of Labor now challenge on this appeal.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

that an employee also has an obligation, even during his off-duty hours, to
honor the standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect of him
and that he may be denied unemployment benefits as a result of misconduct in
connection with his work if he fails to live up to this obligation (see&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Zazycki</u>&nbsp;v.&nbsp;<u>City of Albany,</u>&nbsp;___A.D. 2d ___ [May 26,
1983]; Ann., 89 ALR 2d 1090).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Here, it seems apparent from an
examination of the record that claimant's actions which resulted in his felony
convictions did not directly relate to his employment in the manner commonly
found in most unemployment insurance claims. Nonetheless, he was concededly
employed as a civil servant with a public trust by a government agency which,
being directly accountable to the taxpaying citizenry for its support, must
necessarily maintain the highest standard of integrity and incorruptibility.
Moreover, claimant stands convicted of engaging in the felonious corrupting of
a public official during the period when he was employed in a sensitive
position wherein it was his responsibility to exercise discretionary over
financing and budgetary matters for the agency. Given these circumstances, the
continued presence in a responsible position at the agency of a convicted
felon, such as claimant, would constitute a genuine threat to the integrity of
the agency and also reflect unfavorably upon the agency in the eyes of the
general public. Accordingly, in our judgment, claimant's conduct, which evinced
a conscious and intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his
employer had a right to expect of him, mandates a determination that he was
guilty of misconduct in connection with his employment, as a matter of law, so
as to disqualify him from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.</span></p>

R.R., was employed as a security guard for approximately two years. Claimant
J.M., was employed as a security guard for approximately three and one-half
years. The claimants were scheduled to be on duty the evening of March 19, 1983
in the employer's museum. Prior to going on duty, R.R. spoke with his sergeant
and conveyed misgivings about working with J.M. that night. As a result of
this, the sergeant spoke to the claimants and informed them of the employer's
rule against fighting. He told them that any violation of the rule would result
in their discharge. Shortly thereafter, while in the dining room, the claimants
became involved in a verbal discussion which resulted in yelling and harsh
words being exchanged. The argument continued as they proceeded to the computer
room. During the yelling and screaming in the computer room, each claimant spat
at one another. This led to a physical altercation with both combatants
throwing punches. As a result of this incident, the claimants were discharged
effective May 19, 1982.</span></p>

worked as a garbage collector for a municipality for approximately 21 months
beginning in December, 1980. A condition of his hire and of continued
employment was that he have and maintain a valid driver's license. In
September, 1982, it came to the employer's attention that the claimant had lost
his driver's license in May, 1982, after he was convicted of driving an
uninsured vehicle. He was thereupon discharged effective September 17, 1982.
Claimant had already appealed the motor vehicle conviction. In October, 1982,
claimant conclusively established that he had, in fact, paid an insurance
premium to a broker who was later convicted of misappropriating auto insurance
premiums. Claimant's conviction was reversed and his license was restored.
During the period May, 1982, through his last day at work, claimant was not
required to drive any of the employer's vehicles.</span></p>

his part. Significantly, the claimant did not drive any of the employer's
vehicles during the period that he was without a license. There has been no
showing that claimant did not make a diligent effort to protect his license; on
the contrary, it appears that claimant was able to establish that he had timely
made the required insurance payment, and, therefore, prevailed in his motor
vehicle department proceedings, although after his discharge. Accordingly, we
conclude that the claimant's loss of employment was not due to misconduct on

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The Board
has previously held that members of a military reserve are not totally
unemployed when they perform services at drills required as part of their
reserve service, but that members of the National Guard are totally unemployed,
despite rendering similar services for their units (A.B. 315, 271, 327,499,
337,928). Those decisions were predicated on Section 565.2 (c) of the
Unemployment Insurance Law which excludes National Guard service from the
definition of &quot;employment.&quot; We have upon reconsideration of these
matters, decided that National Guard members and reservists should be treated
alike with respect to performing services at weekly drills. Although the
Unemployment Insurance Law has no similar provision relating to service
performed by members of the military reserves, it is clear that both reservists
and National Guard members are members of the reserve components of the Armed
Forces of the United States. (10 U.S.C. Sections 269,270). In addition, under
federal law, both reservists and National Guard members are required to attend
48 annual paid drills. (10 U.S.C. Section 270; 31 U.S.C. Section 502). Under
these circumstances, it is clear that while attending the 48 weekly drills
mandated by federal law, both reservists and National Guard members perform
similar activities. Accordingly, we conclude that they should be treated in the
same manner for the purpose of determining whether they are totally unemployed
and whether such services can be used to terminate a prior disqualification. We
conclude that claimants were totally unemployed while performing their
mandatory weekly drills and that the pay they received should not be considered
for purposes of determining whether they earned more than the statutory weekly
maximum under the Unemployment Insurance Law during any week. Any prior Board
decisions that may be inconsistent with our decision herein will no longer be
followed.</span></p>

reserve components were considered to have rendered services in employment
while engaging in weekly drill sessions, although members of the National Guard
were not. The distinction may no longer be drawn. The Appeal Board has now held
that reserve and National Guard members &quot;should be treated in the same
manner for the purpose of determining whether they are totally unemployed and
whether such services can be used to terminate a prior disqualification.&quot;</span></p>

weekly drill sessions. Participation in annual field training usually of two

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal from that part of a decision
of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board filed October 7, 1981, which
overruled the initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits because he lost his employment
due to misconduct.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The following facts are undisputed:
Claimant worked as a garage helper for the New York State Office of General
Services for approximately three and one-half years, ending in March, 1981. On
October 1, 1980, the employer notified claimant of its intention to discharge
him because he had submitted five falsified physician's statements covering
eight days of absence from work. Claimant filed a grievance, which was resolved
by a disciplinary settlement agreement with the employer, under the terms of
which he admitted the falsifications, was reinstated in his job, but was placed
on probation for one year. One of the conditions of his probation was that
during the entire year he would participate in a specified drug abuse treatment
and counselling program. Claimant only attended the treatment program for one
month. Upon learning of this violation of the terms of the settlement
agreement, his employer discharged him. Claimant then applied for unemployment
insurance benefits but was initially ruled disqualified on the alternate
grounds that he lost his employment due to misconduct and voluntarily left his
employment without good cause. The Administrative Law Judge overruled the
Commissioner's disqualification on the basis of misconduct but sustained
disqualification on the alternate ground of voluntarily leaving without good
cause. The Appeal Board determined that claimant was not rendered ineligible
from receiving benefits either because he voluntarily left employment or was
guilty of misconduct, holding that claimant's leaving the counselling program
was a matter of poor judgment rather than misconduct. Only the Board's
determination concerning misconduct has been appealed.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Misconduct exists if a claimant's
conduct is &quot;detrimental to the employer's interest or in violation of a
reasonable work condition&quot;&nbsp;<u>(Matter of DeGrego</u>&nbsp;[<u>Levine</u>],
39 NY 2d 180, 184). Clearly the disciplinary settlement agreement was a work
condition - one, in fact, specifically created for claimant in order to give
him a chance to be reinstated in his job. Claimant was fully aware of the
agreement, and it was approved by his union. Participation in the drug abuse
treatment and counselling program for a full year was an essential and
mandatory provision of the disciplinary settlement agreement. Clearly, this
work condition was reasonable - indeed, more than reasonable - in that it was
designed to help claimant overcome a substantial medical problem that was seriously
affecting his ability to hold a job. Claimant admitted that he stopped going to
the drug abuse treatment and counselling program after a month and that he did
so without discussing this decision with either his employer or his drug
counsellor. The Board's determination, that claimant's admitted, unilateral
decision to discontinue the treatment program was merely poor judgment, is
erroneous and is not supported by substantial evidence. Claimant's violation of
his employer's directive which was embodied in the condition of probation in
the disciplinary settlement, with full knowledge of the consequences thereof,
was far less justifiable as a mere mistake in judgment than the violation held
by us to constitute misconduct in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Mclntee (National Ambulance
and Oxygen Serv.&nbsp;</u>-&nbsp;<u>Ross</u>) (64 AD 2d 1003). Therefore, he is
not eligible for benefits (Labor Law, §593).</span></p>

In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Walker</u>, 28 AD 2nd 256, the Appellate Division has
occasion to rule upon the issue of what constitutes a paid vacation within the
meaning of Section 591.3 of the Law. In that case, the employer's manual
provided: &quot;If you should leave the. . .employment for any reason, or you
are released by the company, the vacation period agreed upon will follow the
last day of employment irrespective of any prior election by you or designation
by the company.&quot; The similarity between that clause and the operating
procedure manual clause at issue herein is apparent. The Court in&nbsp;<u>Walker</u>,
in concluding that the subject clause was not legally sufficient to create a
vacation period within the meaning of Section 591.3 of the Law stated that
stated that&quot;. . .the payments bear no relation whatsoever to normal
vacations and vacation payments, which accrue on an annual basis. Neither do
they bear any relationship to the near universal concept of a vacation as a
respite from work, proposed for rest, relaxation and personal pursuits, with
the almost invariable correlary of a return to work at the end of the period .
. The contention that all the benefits of the employment relationship continued
during the so-called vacation period overlooks one important and unusual
concomitant - the reasonably to be anticipated right to return to the job after
the respite from work.&quot;</span></p>

Education of the New York State Department of Education after claimant was
found guilty of professional misconduct in that he inappropriately prescribed
drugs and provided improper treatment to patients. Claimant could not continue
operation of the corporation after his license was revoked because the law
requires that a licensed physician supervise the microbiology work in the lab.
Claimant contacted several licensed physicians in an attempt to have them come
into the corporation so that the corporation could continue. Claimant was
unsuccessful in his endeavor because the physicians did not want the notoriety
of being associated with someone whose license was revoked. Claimant therefore
ceased working for the corporation on June 30, 1982 and commenced steps to
dissolve the corporation, which was completed on November 4, 1982. From July 1
through November 4, 1982, claimant performed no services for the corporation
except for consultations with his accountant concerning the dissolution.</span></p>

credible evidence establishes that claimant's employment ended on June 30, 1982
because his license to practice medicine was revoked. The corporation was
unable to find a licensed physician to supervise the microbiology work as was

employment due to misconduct. His loss of employment came about due to a

in that his license was revoked&nbsp;<u>(See Matter of Malaspina,&nbsp;</u>309
NY 413 and&nbsp;<u>Matter of James</u>, 34 NY 2d 491). Claimant could not have
continued operating the corporation because his license was revoked and it is
because of this that his job ended. Accordingly, we find that claimant's loss

claimant, a laborer, lost his employment under non-disqualifying conditions. He
filed an original claim for benefits effective February 1, 1982, and an
additional claim for benefits effective November 15, 1982. He was not a member
of the union local in the city in which he reported to the local office, but
belonged to the local in another area near his last job site. Transferring his
membership from the union local near his job to the local nearer his home would
have destroyed his chance of being recalled to work at his last job. He had
reason to expect that his recall was imminent. There were no suitable job
openings or prospects in the other city. If he were to transfer his membership,
he would be at the bottom of the seniority list with the local nearer his home.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>&nbsp;The
credible evidence establishes that claimant, whose prospects for obtaining
employment in the city near where he lived were not good, sought employment
through his union local in the area of his last employment. There is no
evidence that his chances of employment in his nearby city were superior to
those in the area of his last job, to which he expected to be recalled shortly.
His testimony to the contrary has not been rebutted. The initial determination
in this case held that the claimant was not available for employment because he
refused to transfer his union membership to another local. Such a transfer
would jeopardize his chances of recall through his current local and place him
at the bottom of seniority with the new local where there are no job prospects.
Since there is no showing that the transfer would do anything other than
decrease his chances of employment, we find his refusal to be reasonable and it
is no indication that he is not attached to the labor market. Under these
conditions, we conclude that claimant was available for employment during the
period in issue.</span></p>

May 1953 until September 30, 1982. He was a member of a union having

clause.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>By November 1981, the employer’s
annual operating losses exceeded $13 million. It projected a loss of at least
$30 million in 1982 and again in 1983 and 1984. The projected loss for 1985 was
in excess of $40 million. The employer was moved by these projections to draft
a plan for restructuring its entire operation, which included substantial
concessions from eleven unions with whom it had collective bargaining
agreements. The employer determined that, in order to remain in operation, an
effort must be made to bring about a saving in labor costs of at least $50
million per year. Failing that, the employer would be compelled to go out of
business. With this goal in mind, the employer met extensively with the
representatives of the various unions from May through August 1982, in an
effort to achieve the threshold requirement for survival. To open the way for
negotiations, the employer made all of its books, records, and forecasts
available to the accounting firm chosen and retained by the unions. After
examination, the unions’ accounting firm verified that the employer’s figures
and projections were accurate. On July 16, 1982, while discussions were going
on with the respective union representatives, the employer sent a letter to all
of its almost 5,000 employees expressing concern for the survival of its
newspaper and mentioning, in passing, that negotiations were underway to
eliminate almost 1500 jobs at the paper. Near the end of July 1982, the employer
and seven unions reached accords, but agreements had yet to be concluded
between the employer and the four remaining unions. In a second letter to all
of the employees dated July 30, 1983 (sic), the employer again detailed the
significance of the negotiations to the survival of the paper. By the end of
August 1982, the employer achieved agreements with the remaining unions. The
immediate result of the accords with all eleven unions was that 1500 positions
would be eliminated.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
primary issues before the board are whether or not the claimant voluntarily
left his employment and, if so, whether such leaving was for good cause under
the Law. To properly review the case, we must examine the entire context in
which the claimant’s separation from his employment arose. From the competent
and credible evidence before us, we conclude that a mandatory reduction in
force had to occur so that the employer could continue its business operation.
Without an almost immediate reduction of nearly 1500 staff members, the
employer’s business would have quickly ceased to exist. The employer and all of
the various unions, including the claimant’s agreed to the legitimacy of the needed
layoffs. What remained to be developed were agreements between the employer and
the respective unions as to how the layoffs were to be allocated. There were a
number of possible agreements, which could have been made. The unions and the
employer could agree that the most junior employees must be laid off first.
They could agree to let the employer have absolute discretion to choose who
would be laid off. They could agree on a formula for random selection. They
could also, as they did herein, allow each and every otherwise eligible
employee to elect to participate in the layoff with the absolute right resting
with the employer to either accept or reject any employee’s application to
enter the reduction plan. The Commissioner of Labor has no apparent objection
to any of the arrangements listed, except the last one, which allows the
employee to participate in the employer’s discretionary allocation of the
layoffs. Because there are elements of employee voluntariness here, it remains
within the discretion of the Board to determine whether or not the voluntary
leaving of employment by offering to personally participate was with good
cause. If the unions had not agreed to participate in a reduction plan, almost
5,000 employees, including the claimant herein, would have quickly become
unemployed with an accompanying acute industrial destabilization within part of
the State of New York. The Legislature of the State of New York has expressed
its policy and concern with the maintenance of existing business (Commerce Law
Sec 100). The renegotiated labor agreements herein are in furtherance of that
policy. It is not the Board’s position or intention to pass judgment on the
provisions of the renegotiated collective bargaining agreements. In this
context, we disagree with the judge’s conclusion that the claimant, by
participating in the negotiated reduction plan, voluntarily left his employment
for personal, non-compelling reasons and without good cause, thereby subjecting
himself to a disqualification. We cannot ignore the fact that under all of the
possible reduction plans described above, the instigating cause for the
claimant’s separation was the employer’s legitimate and mandatory lay off
requirement (<u>Stanford v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board</u>,
147 Cal App. 3d 98).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Throughout all of the proceedings
and all of the cases arising from this employer’s reduction plan, the
Commissioner of Labor has contended that the claimant’s giving up the right to
do his job by signing a buy-out agreement for which he received a monetary
incentive when he could have continued working, was voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause. In so doing, she relies on&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Fisher</u>, 36 NY 2d 146, rev’g 43 AD 2d 753, rev’g Appeal Board 181, 289 and
the Board decisions following&nbsp;<u>Fisher</u>&nbsp;(Appeal Board 339,997;
292,885; and 340,624). We find the instant case distinguishable from Fisher
(supra). In that case, the employer was the United States Postal Service and
was not facing imminent extinction. It was merely making a concerted effort to
reduce its operating costs by cutting the size of its labor force. Moreover,
unlike in the instant case, the claimant in&nbsp;<u>Fisher</u>&nbsp;did not
receive letters from the employer predicting the demise of the United States
Postal Service if a substantial reduction in force did not occur. We conclude
that claimant herein was brought into the decision making process upon finding
himself amidst historical circumstances and economic pressures which caused him
to voluntarily leave his employment. Mandatory layoff was imminent and it is
not within the province of the Board to determine how the layoffs are to be
allocated (<u>Stanford</u>&nbsp;(supra)). Accordingly, under all of the
circumstances herein and in keeping with the Board’s authority regarding
interpretation of the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law (as
reaffirmed by the Court in&nbsp;<u>Fisher</u>&nbsp;(supra)), we held that the
claimant’s employment herein ended under non-disqualifying conditions because
he voluntarily left his employment for personal but compelling reasons.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The provisions of Section 600.7 of
the Unemployment Insurance Law require that a claimant’s benefit rate be
reduced by the proportional amount of the employer’s contribution to the
claimant’s weekly pension payment. It is established that the claimant received
$153 per month as a pension and all contributions to the pension fund were made
by the employer. Accordingly, we find that the claimant’s benefit rate must be
reduced to $90 per week.</span></p>

union in contractual relations with the employer. Under the collective
bargaining agreement, the employer was authorized to close the plant for a
two-week period during the summer, provided it notified the union in advance.
Pursuant to this provision, the employer designated the period from July 4,
1983 through July 17, 1983, as the shutdown period. The employees were
permitted to designate vacation periods other than the period when the plant
was closed. On or about February 1, 1983, vacation request forms were
distributed to the current employees. The employees were to return the form by
March 1, 1983, and the employer would either approve or disapprove each
vacation request. Since the claimant was on a lay off status, he did not receive
the vacation request form and could not inform the employer of his choice for a
vacation period. The claimant was entitled to vacation pay equal to two weeks
and two days wages. The employer paid the claimant his accrued vacation pay on
July 1,1983.</span></p>

determined to reopen this case for the purpose of the consistency of decision,
since we have considered the issue of whether the employer’s shutdown of the
plant from July 4, 1983 through July 17, 1983 constituted a paid vacation in a
number of other cases. The credible evidence establishes that the employees
were given the option to select the times when they wished to be on vacation.
An employee could have a vacation period other than the period when the plant
shutdown. The two-week shutdown of the plant provided for in the collective
bargaining agreement was not a designation of a vacation period as required by
the Labor Law. If the claimant had not been on a layoff status, he could have
chosen a vacation period other than the period of the plant shutdown. The fact
that the claimant was paid vacation pay on July 1, 1983 is not controlling.
Accordingly, we conclude that the period July 4, 1983 through July 17, 1983 was
not a paid vacation period under the Law, and that a claimant was eligible for
benefits (see Appeal Board 349,654).</span></p>

told his subordinate not to leave the employer’s premises until further
notification because a robbery had been committed. However, the claimant was
not so informed and, after putting in a leave slip with his supervisor, he left
at 3:30 p.m. On April 20, 1984, the claimant received a notice of discipline
from the employer alleging that he had falsified his daily attendance record, that
he had been absent without authorization and that he had been insubordinate.
These charges were based on the incidents of March 16, March 23 and March 26.
The disciplinary notice stated that the penalty to be imposed was termination
of employment. The claimant was further advised that he had 14 days in which to
file a grievance objecting to the notice of discipline. He did not file such a
grievance. The claimant was discharged, effective May 16, 1984.</span></p>

credible evidence now before the Board establishes that the claimant did not
leave the employer’s premises before his scheduled departure time on March 16,
that he did request time off from his supervisor on the days in question and
that he was not told on March 26 not to leave the employer’s premises until
further notification. The employer did not produce any witnesses with personal
knowledge of these events. We are constrained to accept the claimant’s credible
testimony on these matters as it was not contradicted by any testimony from
witnesses with personal knowledge of the events. We also accept claimant’s
uncontradicted testimony that employees did customarily sign the attendance
sheet early and then leave the premises at the scheduled departure time and
that employees also customarily took leave time after putting a leave slip on
their supervisor’s desk if the supervisor was not available. Accordingly, we
conclude that the claimant did not commit any deliberate act of misconduct.</span></p>

the claimant did not file a disciplinary grievance which he was entitled to

a voluntary leaving of employment (<u>Matter of LaRocca</u>, 59 N.Y. 2d

affirmative act by the claimant herein, we conclude that he did not leave his

claimant worked for a municipal Department of Parks from April 15, 1951 through

17 through September 1983 for a federal agency. Claimant was laid off and filed
an original claim for benefits on September 19, 1983. Upon retirement from the
municipality, the claimant was eligible to receive a pension of $1,487.48 a
month. The claimant, however, selected a different retirement option available
to him from the municipality which gave him $1,196.80 a month with survivor
benefits to his wife upon his death. The lesser amount was used as a basis for
the reduction in claimant’s unemployment insurance benefit rate in this case.</span></p>

employer’s contention, adopted by the administrative law judge, that claimant’s

amount of pension benefits claimant could have received if he had selected the
higher pension amount available to him under the employer’s plan. Section
600.7(a) of the Law provides for a reduction by the prorated weekly amount of a
pension which the claimant &quot;is receiving.&quot; The Law makes no provision
with respect to how that amount is computed or selected. In past cases, the
Board has interpreted this statute to mean that any reduction due to the
receipt of pension benefits must be based on the pension amount actually paid
to the claimant or an amount to which the claimant’s rights have been
&quot;established&quot; under the Law. (Appeal Board 320,165; 343,175). We find
no basis in Section 600.7 of the Law or in past case law for the reduction of
claimant’s unemployment insurance benefit rate based on a projection of what
the claimant might have received as a pension. Accordingly, we find the
conclusion of the administrative law judge to be in error and not in accord
with Section 600.7 of the Law. Therefore, the initial determination reducing
the claimant’s unemployment insurance benefit rate from $170 to $32 must be

claimant last worked as a clerk and lost that employment under
non-disqualifying conditions. He filed an original claim for benefits effective
May 14, 1984 and was held eligible to receive benefits. The claimant suffers
from degenerative disc disease and was referred by the New York State Office of
Vocational Rehabilitation to a rehabilitation program administered by R.S. Inc.
The claimant entered such program on September 4, 1984. R.S. Inc. is a
not-for-profit corporation engaged in the business of training the mentally and
physically disabled, by working with their individual disabilities so that they
may more readily obtain productive employment. Between September 4 and October
19, 1984 the claimant was trained to be an assembler. As a part of the training
process the claimant received from R.S. Inc. small incentive payment based upon
his production. Such payments, which ranged from $19 to $49 per week during his
training period, were intended only to encourage the claimant to increase his
productivity so as to make him a more desirable employee for a prospective
employer. While in training the claimant was free to accept employment and, in
fact, did seek employment. As a result of his participation in the training
program, the claimant was able to obtain employment which began on October 22,
1984.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
evidence establishes that at the behest of the New York State Office of
Vocational Rehabilitation, the claimant enrolled in a training program with
R.S. Inc. It is the contention of the Commissioner of Labor that the claimant’s
participation in the rehabilitation program constituted employment in that the
payments he received constituted remuneration, and that claimant’s attendance in
the program hindered his search for employment and as a result he was also
unavailable for employment. We disagree. We find that it was not the intention
of the Legislature, nor is it the public policy of this State, that
unemployment insurance benefits be denied to disabled claimants who enroll in a
program designed to assist them in overcoming their disabilities and improving
their chances to obtain employment. Clearly, Section 599 of the Labor Law,
which deals with vocational and related training and the preservation of
eligibility for unemployment benefits despite such training, establishes that
it is public policy to allow participants in certain such programs to remain
eligible for benefits when they are not actively in the labor market looking for
work. However, we note, that we are foreclosed from ruling on the possible
applicability of Section 599 in this case because the Commissioner of Labor did
not choose to issue a determination either approving or disapproving the
claimant’s training program for 599 purposes.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>As for the issues at hand, the fact
that the claimant received token payments from R.S. Inc. does not convince us
that he was their employee and consequently not totally unemployed. The
evidence establishes that such payments were purely incidental to the training
program and should be regarded solely as an incentive designed to encourage the
improvement of the claimant’s skills and consequently to improve his
employability. Significantly, the claimant looked for work and was able to secure
employment within seven weeks from the inception of his training. Accordingly,
under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the claimant was totally
unemployed and available for employment during the period of his participation
in the vocational rehabilitation program.</span></p>

T.J. Amber Jarvis</span></u></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant, a social worker, was
employed by a medical center in a temporary capacity that was scheduled to
terminate on December 10, 1982. On November 1, 1982, she submitted her
resignation effective November 19, 1982, having accepted other similar
employment scheduled to commence December 1, 1982. Claimant admits that between
November 1 and November 19, 19982, she decided to pursue employment
opportunities other than the employment that she was scheduled to commence on
December 1, 1982; therefore, although she attempted to withdraw her
resignation, she was not permitted to do so. Her last day of employment was
November 19, 1982. On November 22, 1982, claimant applied for unemployment
insurance benefits, indicating to the local office only that she lost her
employment because it was &quot;temporary&quot; in nature. She did not disclose
that she had resigned and that she could have continued working until December
10, 1982, or that she had decided not to accept the new employment that she had
been offered.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
affirmed the initial determination, effective November 20, 1982, disqualifying
claimant from benefits because she voluntarily left her employment without good
cause. Claimant was deemed to have been overpaid $125 in benefits, ruled to be
recoverable, and her rights to future benefits were reduced by eight effective
days because of her wilfully made false statement.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant applied to reopen and
reconsider the decision of the ALJ. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board
granted claimant’s application to reopen and reconsider. Subsequently, the
Board decided that on November 19, 1982, the termination date of claimant’s
last employment, she had a validly existing offer of employment and that her
intention at that time regarding whether to accept the new job was immaterial.
Therefore, claimant was found to be separated from her employment under
non-disqualifying conditions, and the determinations of the local office and
the ALJ to the contrary and ruling the benefits paid to be recoverable were
overruled. As to the issue of wilful misrepresentation, that initial
determination was affirmed by the Board, but the penalty of a forfeiture of
eight effective days was modified to four effective days. Upon application by
the Commissioner of Labor, the Board reopened, reconsidered and adhered to its
prior decision.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On this appeal by the Commissioner,
it is urged that the decision of the Board does not have a rational basis and
should be reversed. We disagree with the Board’s decision insofar as it ruled
that claimant’s intention with regard to the acceptance of her new employment
was immaterial when she left her old job on November 19, 1982, and that the
only factor necessary for consideration was a valid, then-existing offer of
other employment. In order for claimant to have left her employment under
non-disqualifying conditions, she had to have left for good cause (Labor Law
§593[1][a]). The only good cause that would attend her leaving under these
circumstances was that, at the time she left, she intended to accept the new
job that awaited her. If claimant’s resignation had been submitted in
expectation of her discharge scheduled for December 10, 1982, it would
constitute a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause (<u>Matter of
La Greca [Catherwood</u>], 30 AD 2d 597). Furthermore, this court has affirmed
without opinion Board decisions ruling that separation from employment after
the refusal of an employer to withdraw a resignation upon a claimant’s request
is a leaving of employment without good cause [see, e.g.&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Waltos (Levine)</u>, 39 AD 2d 644].</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Bearing on the issue of claimant’s
intent are her attempt to withdraw her resignation before leaving, her refusal
to report to the new job, her filing for benefits on November 22, 1982 before
the new job was scheduled to begin, her failure to disclose to the local office
her resignation and offer of new employment, and her statement to the local
office that her only reason for leaving was the &quot;temporary nature&quot; of
the employment. These are factors that must be, but were not, considered by the
Board in determining claimant’s intention. The element of intent is important
here because these facts and circumstances differ from those of&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Curran (Levine)</u>&nbsp;(50 AD 2d 681, revd on dissenting opn below 41 NY
2d 856), on which claimant relies and which the Commissioner attempts to
distinguish. In&nbsp;<u>Curran</u>, the claimant, who left her employment one
week before starting a new position that failed to materialize for lack of
funding, was held to have had good cause for leaving and was ruled eligible for
benefits. Significantly, the failure of the new position to materialize
in&nbsp;<u>Curran</u>&nbsp;could in no way be attributed to any fault of the
claimant. Here, however, the new position was at all times available to
claimant if she wanted to accept it. Her intent in not doing so is not only
relevant but critical to the issue of whether she left her employment under
disqualifying conditions.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In view of the Board’s failure to
consider claimant’s intent, a critical element in determining whether she

evidence establishes that the claimant received a disability retirement pension
to which he contributed five percent. Section 600.7 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law provides for a reduction of unemployment insurance benefits when
the Federal Unemployment Tax Act requires a reduction in order for New York
State to receive full tax credit from the Federal Government. In analyzing this
subsection, we find that the claimant’s disability pension constitutes a
periodic payment which is based on claimant’s previous work, under a plan
contributed to by the claimant’s base period employer. Accordingly, we conclude
that Section 600.7 of the Unemployment Insurance Law is the operative section
and requires a reduction of the claimant’s benefit rate. The amount of the
reduction should be 50 percent of the amount claimant receives. In this
particular case, that amount exceeds the benefit rate and, thus, the claimant’s
rate is reduced to zero.</span></p>

Kyle Kindlon; 114 AD 2d 730</span></u></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Appeal from a decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed October 29, 1984, which ruled that
claimant was entitled to receive benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant, a financial systems
clerk, voluntarily resigned the position, which she had held with the employer
for about two years. It is uncontroverted that claimant initially left the
employer voluntarily for personal reasons. Her resignation was effective in
January 1984. Prior to her resignation, the employer requested that she delay
her actual termination until such time as she had trained the person hired to
replace her. Claimant declined to do so but indicated a possible willingness to
return on a temporary basis at some later date for that purpose.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant did return to work for the
employer for a one-week period in February 1984 for the purpose of training her
replacement. She negotiated a salary with the employer which was higher than
that which she was being paid at the time of her resignation. It was
anticipated that she could adequately train the new employee in one week.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant completed the training of
her replacement in the one-week period. Thereafter, she filed for unemployment
benefits and her initial application was approved. That decision was appealed
by the employer and upheld by the Administrative Law Judge and the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board. The employer appeals.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Board found that Labor Law §593
required a determination that claimant was eligible for unemployment benefits.
That section, in pertinent part, provides:</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>No days of total unemployment shall
be deemed to occur after a claimant’s voluntary separation without good cause
from his last employment prior to the filing of his claim until he has
subsequently worked in employment on not less than three days in each of five
weeks and earned remuneration at least equal to five times his weekly benefit
rate (<u>id</u>.).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Board rejected the employer’s
position that claimant’s temporary employment was so intertwined and
interrelated to her voluntary termination that the two periods were essentially
inseparable.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>We find that the Board’s decision
in the instant case contravenes the basic intent and spirit of the Unemployment
Insurance Law [<u>see, Matter of Shanley (Catherwood)</u>, 27 AD 2d 496,
498-499]. Labor Law article 18 provides its own guideline for the
&quot;interpretation and application of this article&quot; by setting forth the
declared public policy of the State with regard to unemployment compensation
(Labor Law §501). In setting forth the purpose and policy of the unemployment
insurance program in the State, the statute expressly refers to&nbsp;<u>involuntary</u>&nbsp;unemployment
as a public problem. In interpreting a statutory program or enactment, the
courts must reasonably consider the general spirit and purpose of the enactment
and the circumstances which prompted its creation. Ordinarily, the preferred
construction is one which furthers the object, spirit and purpose behind the
Legislature’s enactment of the program (McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1,
Statutes, §§ 96, 124).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>It is abundantly clear from the
record that claimant’s unemployed status at the time of her application was
self-imposed and in no way involuntary. The one week she spent training her
replacement was not inconsistent with her purpose of completely terminating her
employment voluntarily. The reason claimant was unemployed at the end of the
one-week period cannot be viewed in a vacuum. She had no employment at the end
of that one-week because she had already elected to quit her job and be
replaced by someone else. She knew well that the training of her replacement
was to be of very short duration. Such temporary activity for her former
employer under the existing circumstances did not constitute a new period of
employment for purposes of Labor Law §593 [<u>Matter of Williams (Levine)</u>,
51 AD 2d 1094]. Any other result would give undue import to a hypertechnical
construction of the Unemployment Insurance Law in a manner which would do a
disservice not only to the employer, but also to the purpose intended by the
Legislature when the program was enacted, i.e., to ease the burden created by
involuntary unemployment [<u>Matter of Aquilina (New York Tel. Co., - Ross)</u>,
62 AD 2d 1096].</span></p>

     the fact that she had not agreed to conduct this training prior to

     claimant’s reason for unemployment at the end of the week period
     &quot;cannot be viewed in a vacuum&quot; inasmuch as the period of time

claimant was employed as a drill press operator from January 1977 through

discharged pursuant to the employer’s rule that any absence of more than ten

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the claimant did not report to work after
September 25, 1985, due to his incarceration on criminal charges. His failure
to report to work violated a reasonable condition of his employment, which
required regular and punctual attendance. Claimant had caused his arrest and
incarceration by his own actions, which resulted in his guilty plea to a
felony. We do no agree with the judge’s reliance on&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Betancourt</u>&nbsp;(60 AD 719 aff’g Appeal Board 220,539 and 230,890D). In our
opinion, the Court based its interpretation on the fact in that case that the
claimant was an ordinary seaman on a merchant ship. Because of his arrest,
claimant missed the scheduled sailing of the ship and so that employer had no
alternative but to replace that claimant. Such a compulsion is not present in
this case. In view of the ruling in&nbsp;<u>Matter of James</u>&nbsp;(34 NY 2d
491), we think that the more appropriate legal issue herein is misconduct
rather than provoked discharge. Claimant was absent from work due to his own
actions which do not justify the absence. Accordingly, we conclude that
claimant lost his employment through misconduct in connection therewith (Appeal
Board 199,344; 332,914 and 361,791).</span></p>

replacement before her starting time but did not want to be late. Instead of
taking some time in the morning, the claimant decided not to be late by taking
the whole day off. The claimant could have gone on a Saturday, when she did not
work, to replace the contact lenses but she did not want to wear her
eyeglasses, which were available. On January 29, the claimant went to the
district attorney’s office to obtain a letter to excuse some previous absence.
The claimant did not have an appointment to see the assistant district attorney
concerning that matter and the claimant could have telephoned instead to ask that
the letter be mailed to her rather than taking time from work. On the following
day, January 30, the claimant did not report to work either, because she
received a telephone call to take her mother home from the hospital. Her mother
was under medication at the time and had high blood pressure. The claimant did
not attempt to contact two of her brothers to see if they could have taken her
mother home instead. Escorting her mother home from the hospital was not an all

13 through April 19, claimant worked on April 12,1984. After the Easter recess,
she next worked on April 30, 1984.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Section
590.10 of the Labor Law applies: &quot;to any week commending during an
established and customary vacation period or holiday recess, not between such
academic terms of years, provided the claimant performed services for such
institution immediately before such vacation period or holiday recess and there
is a reasonable assurance that the claimant will perform any services described
in this subdivision or subdivision eleven of this section in the period immediately
following such vacation period or holiday recess…&quot;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In this and several other decision,
the Board will set forth its interpretation of that statute. Consideration has
been given to Field Memorandum 10-84 of the Commissioner of Labor and to the
arguments advanced by parties and interested groups at hearings upstate and in
New York City. In view of the fact that any interpretation of this section must
be in harmony with our prior interpretations of Section 590.10, we will briefly
summarize those rulings.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In numerous cases involving the
possibility of work as a per diem substitute teacher, we have held that a
reasonable assurance of employment exists when the employer expresses a good
faith willingness to place and/or has in fact placed a claimant’s name on the
list from which substitutes are called to teach, and when the employer will in
good faith consider the possibility of offering per diem work to the claimant.
It is the responsibility of the parties to demonstrate, with competent
testimony from knowledgeable witnesses concerning the employer’s personnel
practices and hiring procedures, that these basic conditions have been met.
Absent proof that both of these conditions have been satisfied, there is no
reasonable assurances of employment in an instructional capacity as a per diem
substitute teacher. As for full-time teachers and for teachers who work some
regular part-time schedule, we have held that reasonable assurance between
academic years and terms is usually found when the employer expresses, orally
or in writing, a good faith intent to reemploy the teachers even if such
reemployment is subject to preconditions such as budget, enrollment or
registration.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In determining the intent of the
Legislature when it amended Section 590.10, we are guided by the holding of the
Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Miller</u>, (78 AD 2d 561, aff’g Appeal Board
299,745), wherein the Court found that an intent of Section 590.10 was to
further alleviate the financial burden on school districts which would be
imposed if the school districts were required to finance unemployment insurance
benefits for employees traditionally unemployed during certain periods of time.
We see no reason to believe that the intent in amending Section 590.10 was any
different for established and customary vacation periods and holiday recesses.
We, therefore, conclude that the amendment serves to restrict entitlement to
benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Although Field Memorandum 10-84
does achieve that purpose, we find the employer’s argument to be more
compelling that the stringent requirements of the memorandum effectively negate
the intent of the statute by compelling school systems to guarantee work to all
substitute teachers on the day before and the day after the vacation or recess
regardless of the school’s needs for substitute teachers on those specific
days, if the school wishes to avoid the burden of unemployment benefits during
the vacation or recess. However, while we agree that there should be a broader
interpretation of the statute than that set forth in the Field Memorandum, we
are also mindful of the fact that the unemployment insurance system is social
legislation which must be liberally construed so as to extend coverage to
workers unemployed through no fault of their own. A balance must be struck.
This balance must also allow for its administration by the local office so that
benefit payments can be made promptly when due.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Accordingly, although the statute
requires work &quot;immediately&quot; before, and an assurance of work in
&quot;the period immediately&quot; following the vacation or recess, we find
that the time periods are identical, regardless of the difference in words used
by the Legislature. That time frame must be more than the one day called for in
the Field Memorandum. Considering that the vacations or recesses usually are a
week or two long, at times such as Christmas, Easter/Passover, and midwinter
break or President’s Week, we conclude that a week would be an appropriate
measure of the &quot;immediate&quot; time provided in the statute. The first
condition of the statute is, therefore, satisfied if a person worked in the
week before the vacation period or holiday recess and has a &quot;reasonable
assurance&quot; of work for the educational institution in the week following
the vacation or recess. We must now address the question of whether the
reasonableness of that assurance is the same as that between academic years or
terms. We think not. A reasonable assurance of employment in the next academic
year or term recognizes the possibility/probability of work at some time during
the next four to ten months. A reasonable assurance for a school year means
that a substitute might be called on up to 180 days (Education Law, Section
3604.7). As indicated above, this reasonable assurance is established by a
presence on the list from which substitutes are called to teach and the
employer’s good faith willingness to consider the person for a vacancy. If a
person is not called to work as per diem substitute during the year or term,
that does not automatically negate the existence of a prior reasonable
assurance. In order for an assurance of reemployment to be reasonable for a
significant shorter period of time (namely for the week following the vacation
or recess), we think that there must be a greater likelihood that the person
will be considered and possibly called to work during the specified week. To satisfy
this requirement, an employer must demonstrate that it had a priority list
which is used to call substitutes during the week after the vacation or recess
and that the employer would only include on this priority list those
substitutes who had worked in the week prior to the vacation or recess.
Provided the employer was prepared to come forward with proof of the good faith
operation of such a priority system, we find that the short periods of time
involved make it unreasonable and unpracticable to require the employer to give
individual notice of the priority system to any person who substitutes during
the week prior to the vacation period or holiday recess. The lack of such
notice does not relieve the employer of its responsibility to demonstrate, with
competent testimony from knowledgeable witnesses concerning the employer’s
personnel practices and hiring procedures, that all of the other requirements,
which we have set forth, have been met.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In our opinion, this system would
be administratively workable for employers and the local offices. Employers can
establish the priority list for the week after the vacation or recess by
keeping track of those who accept per diem work in the week before the recess.
If a claim is filed during a vacation period or holiday recess, the local
office can promptly determine eligibility by establishing whether the claimant
had worked in the week prior to the vacation or recess and by establishing
whether the employer had an operational priority system for after the vacation
period or holiday recess. We also would note that, although employers may not
have been aware of our above criteria prior to these decision, they effectively
are not aggrieved by the criteria. The standards are much more flexible than
those of the Field Memorandum of the Commissioner of Labor. It now remains for
us to apply the above principles to the facts of this case.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The credible evidence establishes
that the claimant worked within five school days prior to the holiday recess in
question. However, the credible (evidence) further establishes that the
employer did not demonstrate that it had a priority list, including only those
substitute teaches who had worked in the five school days prior to the holiday
recess, which priority list was used to call substitute teachers during the
five school days after the holiday recess. The claimant was called to work
within five school days after the holiday recess but not from a priority list.
We, therefore, conclude that, based on the criteria established herein, the
claimant did not have reasonable assurance of employment for the period
immediately following the holiday in question, pursuant to Section 590.10 of
the Law.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>FINDINGS OF FACT: The claimant was
employed for about ten years as a machinist. Approximately four or five months
prior to the loss of his employment, the claimant was warned and suspended for
one week because he failed to punch his time card in or out when leaving for
lunch. The claimant was aware that all arrivals and departures on employer’s
premises must be accurately recorded on the employee’s time card.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On June 3, 1986, the claimant
arrived at 2:50 p.m. for the beginning of his 3:00 p.m. shift. Upon signing in,
he observed a notice indicating that he and a number of other employees were to
be placed on temporary lay off status at the end of the shift. Shortly
thereafter, claimant began to feel ill. He thought that if he ate something he
would feel better so he punched out at 5:45 p.m. for something to eat. He
returned at 6:04 p.m. and punched back in. He was still not feeling well so he
left the premises. He did not punch his time card to indicate that he was
leaving for the day nor did he change a previously entered notation on the back
of his time card to the effect that he would be working a full eight hour day.
When management became aware of claimant’s failure to properly punch his time
card, he was suspended. Two or three days thereafter, the claimant was formally
advised that he was being discharged and that the reason for his discharge was
his failure to punch out his time card after a previously suspension for the
same type of conduct.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Prior to the redetermination of his
claim, the claimant received $80 in benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Upon filing his claim for benefits,
claimant advised the unemployment insurance office that he was no longer
working because of a lay off. He knew at the time that he was no longer working
because he had been discharged for time clock violations.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: We
disagree with the administrative law judge’s opinion that claimant’s failure to
punch his time clock was a mere judgmental error. We further disagree with the
administrative law judge’s opinion that an employee scheduled for layoff does
not have to complete the final work shift. Claimant has offered no valid excuse
as to why he failed to punch out his time card. Inasmuch as the claimant had
previously been suspended for time clock irregularities, we conclude that the
claimant’s course of conduct rises to the level of misconduct within the
meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law and subjects him to the
disqualification imposed. Since the claimant is subject to disqualification,
the benefits he received constitute an overpayment and must be repaid pursuant
to Section 597.4 of the Law. Further, since he received benefits to which he
was not entitled, the proper forfeiture penalty was the eight day penalty
initially imposed by the unemployment insurance office.</span></p>

claimant, a tenured teacher for the New York City Board of Education, applied
for an was granted an unpaid leave of absence effective October 1, 1984 through
June 30,1985. She obtained this leave of absence because she was tired of
teaching and desired to seek employment in the private sector. The claimant
then worked for two weeks for R.J.G. until October 12, 1984. Thereafter, she
obtained employment with another private employer for approximately nine weeks
from October 30 until December 28,1984.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The claimant filed an original
claim for benefits on December 31,1984. She did not seek to resume her teaching
duties as of that date. The employer’s policy allows for teachers on leave to
apply for another teaching position before the end of their leave. The claimant
was held eligible to receive benefits at the rate of $180 a week, and received
$4,680 in unemployment insurance benefits for the statutory weeks from January
13 through July 7, 1985. The claimant obtained an extension of her unpaid leave
of absence for a period from July 1, 1985 through June 30,1986. In October
1985, the claimant resumed teaching on a per diem substitute basis until about
January 1986, as authorized under the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement. In January 1986, she resumed teaching as a regular teacher for the
employer herein.</span></p>

an employee of the employer herein, while on leave.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>When she filed her original claim
for benefits, she still was on a leave from the employer herein. However, she
had signified her intention of leaving her employment for personal and
non-compelling reasons, namely that she was tired of teaching and was seeking
work in the private sector. We note that the claimant could have resumed her
position as a teacher on a per diem basis or applied for a full-time teaching
position at the time she filed her original claim for benefits and while she
was in receipt of benefits, but made no effort to do so. Significantly, it was
not until she exhausted all of her benefits, that the claimant returned to
teaching with the employer herein first on a per diem basis and then full-time.
The Board has previously held that a claimant, who files an original claim for
benefits, while on leave, and immediately after holding a temporary position,
is deemed to have voluntarily left his employment without good cause (See
Appeal Board No. 324,500A). The case before the Board is clearly
distinguishable from the&nbsp;<u>Matter of Wilner</u>&nbsp;(78 AD 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;56),
which case concerns a claimant who had sought to return to her secretarial
position while she was on leave and before she filed her original claim for
benefits. Furthermore, unlike the case before the Board, the claimant in the
aforementioned case had no expressed any intention of leaving the field of
secretary work.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Section 501 of the Labor Law states
that the public policy of the State is to provide benefits for an applicant due
to his or her &quot;involuntary unemployment&quot; and who, &quot;through no
fault of their own,&quot; have lost their jobs. This clear cut public policy
would be contravened if this claimant was held eligible to receive benefits.
Under the circumstances, any prior cases of the Board, which are inconsistent
with the reasoning and the result reached in the instant case, are no longer to
be followed. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant voluntarily left her
employment for personal and non-compelling reasons and without good cause.</span></p>

as amended.</span></p>

were employed as pari-mutuel clerks at a harness racing track until they went
on strike on January 1, 1986. The racing meet at the track was due to end after
racing concluded on January 6, 1986, but the track shut down because of the
strike. All claimants would have been laid off as of January 7, 1986, when the
track was due to close until the scheduled date of reopening of the next meet,
March 24, 1986. Claimants engaged in picketing at the race track from January 1
through January 6, but picketing ceased as of January 7, 1986. The strike had
been called when the previous union contract expired on December 31, 1985 and a
new contract had not been successfully negotiated.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>OPINION</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
present case falls between two established precedents concerning whether
claimants are subject to a suspension of benefit rights during an industrial
controversy. The Court has held that when a claimant loses employment due to an
industrial controversy, even if the claimant was due to be laid off shortly
after the controversy began, the seven week suspension continues. This is true
even if claimant was told before the industrial controversy started that he
would be laid off on a specific date, providing that the industrial controversy
actually began before the date of the lay off (<u>Matter of Echevarria</u>, 273
App. Div. 1046, reversing Appeal Board 16,034). However, it has also been held
that, if an employer goes out of business or moves to a different locality
after an industrial controversy began, the seven week suspension ends at the
time the business is terminated (Appeal Board 20,677).</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In the present case, the credible
evidence establishes that all of the claimants would have been laid off as of
January 7, 1986, but the strike began before that date. The evidence also establishes
that the race track ceased operations, by law, as of January 7, 1986. Although
the employer was not actually out of business as of January 7,1986 because it
was scheduled to resume operations on March 24,1986, as a practical matter the
employer had actually ceased such operations as would have required claimants
services. We thus conclude that, during the period from January 7 through March
23, 1986, the employer was, in fact, not in business and the strike cannot be
said to have continued at that time because there were no services the
claimants can be said to have withheld beginning January 7, 1986. This was
evidenced by the fact that picketing had ceased as of that date. Under the
circumstances, we conclude that the suspension period ended January 7,1986. It
is not necessary to determine if the industrial controversy would thereafter
resume on March 24,1986 when the employer was due to resume its operation, nor
to determine if claimants would again be subject to a suspension for the
remainder of the seven week period if the strike had resumed.</span></p>

determine claimant’s eligibility for such benefits. The ALJ stated that he was
bound by the arbitrator’s factual determinations as to claimant’s conduct as
well as the determination that she had been insubordinate. Given those
findings, the ALJ made his independent determination that claimant’s actions

additional findings of fact and concluded that claimant’s conduct did not
constitute misconduct. The appellate Division affirmed stating that
&quot;(t)here was substantial evidence in the record presented…to support the

claimant has presented no reasonable excuse for his failure to report at the
local office on one of the seven days immediately preceding August 23. He knew
that he was supposed to report to the office before August 23 and he had no
right to assume that he would be permitted to report at his leisure. Compliance
with reporting requirements is essential for the proper administration of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. Failure to comply, in the absence of a reasonable
excuse is sufficient ground for the imposition of a stop order. However, there
is no justification for the stop order being made effective as of August 9. The
claimant reported on August 15 and was in good standing until at least that
day, which was the final day of his three week waiting period. There appears to
be no reason why the claimant should be deprived of credit for any of the
period during which he fully complied with all reporting requirements. We
therefore hold that claimant must be credited with the statutory three week
waiting period which ended on August 15, 1938.</span></p>

claimant was employed for approximately 29 years by a steel manufacturing
company. He lost his employment under non-disqualifying conditions on July 25,
1986. Claimant filed an original claim for benefits effective July 28,1986. He
subsequently received almost a full 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits
thereafter, through the week ending February 1,1987. Claimant applied for a
company pension for which he was eligible based on his age and seniority. The
pension was wholly financed by the employer. The employer’s pension program
consisted of a lump sum special payment and the receipt of regular monthly pension
payments thereafter. As of December 31, 1986 claimant was entitled under the
collective bargaining agreement entered into between his union and the employer
to receive a special payment of 24 weeks of vacation pay, totaling $7,180.88.
The employer on January 2,1987 paid claimant $3,077.52 of such special payment
in the form of six weeks vacation pay. As claimant had elected to retire
effective February1, 1987, on March 1, 1987 claimant received a check for the
remainder of the special payment, $4,103.36 to cover the period of the first
three months of his pension, February 1 through April 30, 1987. As of May 1,
1987 claimant was entitled to receive a regular pension of $440 per month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>In this matter, the essential facts
are not in dispute. Claimant, a regular student at the State University of New
York at Buffalo, was employed by its Educational Opportunity Center from
January 26, 1984 to September 12,1984, during which time she regularly attended
school and had no other employment. She lost her employment under
non-disqualifying conditions and, upon her application for unemployment
benefits on December 19, 1984, she accurately reported the nature of her
employment on the application and that she was a student at the State
University where she was employed. When the local unemployment insurance office
requested wage information from claimant’s employer, it was notified by the
employer, in writing, that claimant was a student rendering services at her
educational institution and should be denied benefits under the provisions of
Labor Law Section 511 (15). Nevertheless, and as a result of an apparent
oversight at the local office, an initial determination was made awarding
claimant benefits. These benefits continued until April 1985, when the employer
questioned the experience rating charges against it and erroneously notified the
local office that it had no record of claimant being employed. This information
prompted a review of the claim by the Unemployment Insurance Division in
Albany, which, upon recognition of claimant’s status as a student in regular
attendance, advised the local office to invalidate claimant’s claim for
benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Accordingly, a redetermination was
issued by the local office ruling claimant ineligible to receive benefits,
effective December 17, 1984, and charging her with an overpayment of $860 in
benefits. After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge sustained the
determination finding the overpayment in benefits to be recoverable, which
finding was reversed by the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board upon the ground
that there was no authority for the Commissioner of Labor to review and
redetermine claimant’s eligibility, after the award of benefits, in the absence
of &quot;new or corrected information&quot;, as required by Labor Law Section
597(3), which statute did not contemplate the discovery of errors or mistakes
by a local office as within its provisions. This appeal by the Commissioner
ensued.</span></p>

limitations imposed by this statute and concluded that, essentially, its
purpose was to prevent &quot;the Department of Labor from simply changing its
mind&quot; and that &quot;where an initial determination appears to be
erroneous in light of new or corrected information, it would be a waste of time
and effort to wait for a referee to correct the error&quot; [<u>Matter of
Dunford (Roberts)</u>], 111 AD 2d 1067). Accordingly, we concluded that
&quot;the phrase ‘new or corrected information’ should be liberally
construed&quot; (<u>id</u>.). Although&nbsp;<u>Dunford</u>&nbsp;may be
distinguished on its facts, since it concerned &quot;an amplification of prior
information&quot;, the rule of construction established should obtain and apply
to a situation where, as here, upon internal review by a higher authority, it
is manifest that the original determination was incorrect in fact or law. It is
both an inherent power vested in the Commissioner, as well as an affirmative
obligation that the law be properly administered and erroneous determinations
of eligibility corrected. Absent such powers, in a case such as the one at bar,
benefits erroneously paid would not only be retained, but would continue
notwithstanding a claimant’s obvious ineligibility. Accordingly, the
determination of the Board cannot stand.</span></p>

instructed to install three gear boxes on a production line. The work required
him to set up each job individually after arranging with the line manager for a
time for the line to be shut down. Generally, claimant would work alone, but
the final stages in which the gear box was actually lowered into place required
claimant to call another person to help him. Claimant’s supervisor expected
that all three boxes could be installed well within claimant’s ordinary shift.</span></p>

that he was avoiding work and when claimant attempted to call for the
assistance of the second individual, he was interrupted by his supervisor. They
had words and claimant was instructed to report to the plant manager’s office.
After a discussion there, it was concluded that claimant had been insubordinate
and he was suspended. One week later, on March 12, at a meeting between
management and claimant and his union representative he was offered
reinstatement with no loss of benefits, including seniority. Under this plan he
would not be paid for the week that he had been out of work. The only condition
attached to his reinstatement was that he come back to work under &quot;intent
to discharge,&quot; a status in which he would be subject to summary dismissal
after any infraction of company rules. Claimant declined the offer of
reinstatement because he did not want to work under those circumstances. He was
thereupon removed from the company’s payroll. One week later, at a similar
meeting, another offer was made to claimant under which he could be rehired
with no seniority and be given a different job from which, in time he could bid
up to his most recent job level. He would be regarded if he accepted the offer,
as a new employee. Claimant also rejected that offer.</span></p>

Unemployment Insurance Program Letter dated December 24,1986, the United States
Department of Labor has modified the definition of &quot;reasonable

and within terms provisions, particularly where the circumstance of employment
change from one academic period to the next. In order for reasonable assurance
to exist, the economic terms and conditions of the position in the second
academic term or period must not be substantially less than those for the job
in the first period. The claimant had worked on a full-time position during the
1985-1986 school year, but was only placed on the list from which substitutes are
called for the 1986-87 school year. The record thus lacks substantial evidence
from which to conclude that the claimant would be given substantially the same
amount of employment in the subsequent school year. Under these circumstances,
we now conclude that the claimant did not have reasonable assurance of
continuing employment in the 1986-87 school year under the same or
substantially similar terms and conditions as her employment in the 1985-86
school year. Accordingly, she was eligible to receive benefits during the

employment application containing the question &quot;have you ever been

answered &quot;no&quot; to this question. As part of the employment process,
the claimant was investigated by the company. The investigation disclosed that

that the fact that a claimant is given a conditional discharge for an offense

statement on the application for employment was a false statement concerning a

was employed by a public relations firm as an administrative assistant for
approximately 15 months until May 5, 1988. On April 6, 1988, the employer
instituted a new policy regarding smoking in its workplace. Thereafter, smoking
would not be permitted in common areas, including the receptionist area,
conference rooms, hallways and central production areas. Smoking would only be
permitted in private enclosed offices and the employer’s library/mail room.
Claimant, who was a heavy smoker, was assigned to work in one of the common
areas. The employer made an attempt to accommodate her by allowing her the use
of a private enclosed office, pending the employer's contemplated acquisition
of additional office space. However, claimant's use of the enclosed office
proved inconvenient for the employer. Therefore, she had to be moved back to
the common area to perform her duties. Claimant became offended by the
employer’s smoking policy and the employer’s determination that her use of the
existing enclosed office would not suit the employer’s convenience. Therefore,
she voluntarily resigned her employment.</span></p>

There is no competent evidence to support the judge’s conclusion that claimant
was discharged. Claimant’s reason for voluntarily resigning her employment must
be considered personal and non-compelling. The employer’s smoking policy was
reasonable. Moreover, the employer made attempts to accommodate the claimant by
allowing her temporary use of an enclosed room in which she could smoke and
work. We conclude that the claimant voluntarily left her employment without
good cause and she is subject to disqualification. Inasmuch as claimant
voluntarily left her employment there is no basis for the determination that
claimant lost her employment through misconduct in connection therewith.</span></p>

was employed as a letter of credit clerk for a bank for about three months
until August 11, 1987, when he was discharged. On his first day of employment,
claimant filled out a &quot;post-employment questionnaire,&quot; in which he
answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question: &quot;Will you permit our physician
to examiner you?&quot; Several days later claimant was directed to go to the
medical facility where employees underwent examinations for the employer. When
he got to the facility he was handed a form which had a stamped statement on the
top saying that the patient understood that he would be required to provide a
urine specimen which would be tested for drug use. Upon reading this, claimant
refused to provide a specimen and thus did not complete the physical
examination. During the remainder of his employment claimant was repeatedly
advised that unless he completed the examination he would be discharged, but he
refused to do so because he believed that his privacy was being improperly
invaded. He was discharged on August 11, 1987 because of his refusal to
complete the physical examination.</span></p>

credible evidence now before the Board establishes that prior to the time he
went to take the physical examination, claimant had no notice that a condition
of his continuing employment would be that he had to undergo a urinalysis test
for drug use. In addition, there is no evidence that the employer had any
suspicion that claimant might be using drugs. To the contrary, the evidence
shows that the employer did not question this point at all.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>There have been a number of cases
involving the issue of whether particular public employees could be required to
submit to drug testing urinalysis. While there have been decisions both
upholding drug testing programs and enjoining them, all the cases have held that
such tests constitute a search and seizure. In addition, even in those cases
upholding drug testing, the courts have found that the employer must have had
either a reasonable suspicion of drug use or there must have been adequate
advance notice that such testing was a condition of employment. (<u>Patchogue-Medford

Employees</u>&nbsp;v.&nbsp;<u>Weinberg</u>, 818 F 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;935.) In
the present case, the employer is a private corporation and thus can establish
its own rules of employment. However, based on the evidence in this case and on
the decisions cited above, we conclude that as there was no reasonable
suspicion of drug use or specific advance notice that such testing would be a
condition of employment, the claimant’s refusal to submit to urinalysis was not
an act of misconduct.</span></p>

claimant was employed as a quality control worker for a food processing firm
for about two years until May 13, 1988. During this term of employment, she was
concurrently attending college. She would work on a full-time basis during the
semester breaks and the employer would otherwise arrange her work schedule so
as not to interfere with her classes. When classes were in session, claimant
worked four or five days per week, working a few hours in the morning and a few
hours later in the day. On May 13, claimant informed the employer that she
could no longer work her normal hours because her curriculum required her to be

the employment was made by the claimant and not the employer. It has been
repeatedly held that leaving employment to attend school does not constitute

filed an original claim for benefits effective April 18, 1988. During his base
period, claimant was employed by a corporation formed in September 1985, of
which he was a 50 percent stockholder as well as the president. The corporation
operated a store where food was prepared and sold for take-out purposes. On
April 13, 1988 there was a fire at night and the place was damaged and needed
substantial repairs. As of the date of the hearing, June 19, 1988, the repairs
had not been completed, but were far enough along that claimant would have been
able to return to work in about a week or two. The bulk of the repairs was to
be done by the owner of the premises. Thereafter, the corporate owner of the
business would need about a day or two to prepare the machines to reopen the
business. During the period that the business was closed, claimant wrote six
checks consisting of payments for taxes, electric utility and telephone bills.
He last visited the premises about one week before the hearing.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the employer corporation including the
claimant were unable to conduct their business beginning with April 14, 1988.
However, the business was not dormant. The premises were being renovated during
that period and would be available for use in about a week or two. The Appeal
Board has previously held that as long as the claimant remains an officer and
stockholder and continues to render some services and there is no dissolution
of the corporation, then the said officer and stockholder is not totally
unemployed (Appeal Board 59,671). In the instant case the claimant wrote a
number of checks during the period that the premises were being renovated. In
addition, the claimant testified that after the renovations are completed by
the landlord of the premises he would need a day or two to prepare the machines
used in preparing the food that was to be sold for take home purposes. It
cannot be said that during this period claimant was not engaged in corporate
business. The corporation which had been formed in September 1985 remained in
business and will continue in business after the renovations are completed.
Under these circumstances, claimant was not totally unemployed during the
period in issue.</span></p>

claimant worked as a laborer for the employer herein for about six months until
January 5, 1988. In October 1987, the employer instituted a new policy whereby
workers would be given points for incidents of absences or latenesses. The
accumulation of 20 points within a 12 month period would result in automatic
termination of employment. As of January 5,1988, claimant had accumulated 18
points under this system. He reported to work late on January 6, giving him an
additional two points at which time he was discharged. Claimant attributed this
lateness to the fact that his alarm clock did not go off due to a power
failure. Claimant filed a grievance through his union and the matter eventually
went to arbitration. By decision dated May 31, 1988, the arbitrator found that
the claimant did violate the employer’s attendance policy and also rejected
claimant’s explanation for the incident of January 6, as unsupported by any
evidence. However, the arbitrator ruled further that the attendance policy was
implemented unilaterally by the employer in violation of the union contract and
that the claimant should be reinstated to his job without back pay.</span></p>

such, we are bound by the arbitrator’s findings of fact (<u>Matter of Ranni</u>,
58 NY 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;715). The arbitrator found that the claimant had
violated the employer’s attendance policy and further found that the final
incident, which directly precipitated his discharge, was under circumstances
which could not be excused. We also note that we would reach the same
conclusion based on the testimony and evidence given by the parties at the
hearing before the administrative law judge. In addition, the fact that the
arbitrator reinstated the claimant because the attendance policy was instituted
in violation of the union contract cannot serve to excuse the claimant from the
consequences of his actions. Significantly, claimant’s was the first case

Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, filed March 26, 1987, which ruled that
claimant was entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant, a firefighter, sustained
a broken wrist while off duty in June 1985. As a result of his injury, claimant
was unable to work as a firefighter for approximately one year. Claimant was
able to perform light duty as of January 10,1986, but no suitable position was
available at that time.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Claimant thereafter applied for
unemployment insurance benefits and the local office determined that claimant
was eligible to receive benefits during the period from January 13, 1986 to
June 1, 1986 when claimant returned to work as a firefighter. The employer
objected to the initial determination on the ground that,&nbsp;<u>inter</u>&nbsp;<u>alia</u>,
claimant was not totally unemployed prior to March 16, 1986 because he remained
on the employer’s payroll until this date. A hearing was held in which there
was evidence that by the end of 1985, claimant had exhausted all of his
accumulated sick leave time. During the period in issue, January 13, 1986
through March 16,1986, claimant was paid on the basis of his 1986 sick leave
entitlement and pursuant to a term of the collective bargaining agreement,
which provided that an employee who has exhausted all of his sick leave time
may use current year vacation time as additional sick leave. Following the
hearing the Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter ALJ) ruled that claimant was
not totally unemployed during the period he received his salary.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board subsequently reversed that part of the decision of the ALJ and sustained
the initial determination finding claimant eligible during the entire period in
question. The Board reasoned that claimant’s vacation time was converted into additional
sick leave under the collective bargaining agreement and such sick leave
benefits do not constitute remuneration under Labor Law Section 517 (2)(a).
Since claimant performed no services for the employer during this period and
received no remuneration, the Board concluded that claimant was totally
unemployed and eligible for benefits. This appeal by the employer ensued.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The employer contends that the
Board erred in finding claimant eligible for unemployment benefits during the
period he continued to receive his full salary. Remuneration, as defined in
Labor Law Section 517, is relevant to making a base period determination of a
claimant’s eligibility [<u>see</u>,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Bachuretz (Roberts)</u>,
___ AD 2d ___ (May 5, 1988);&nbsp;<u>Matter of Rothstein (Roberts)</u>, 96 AD
2d 699]. The Board reasoned that since claimant’s weeks of paid sick leave
would not be considered remuneration or weeks of employment for the purpose of
establishing claimant’s future eligibility for benefits, it should not be
considered employment or compensation so as to make claimant ineligible at
present. The Board’s determination of what constitutes &quot;total
unemployment&quot; under the Labor Law is entitled to great deference and must
be upheld if it is rational [<u>see</u>,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Berger (Ross)</u>,
41 NY 2d 1065, 1066;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Fisher (Levine)</u>, 36 NY 2d 146, 150].
We are not persuaded that the Board’s decision here was irrational. The Board
could also rationally conclude that claimant’s vacation time allotment was
converted into additional sick leave time under the provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>The employer also contends that the
Board erred in finding that claimant was available for light-duty employment
during the period in question. There was evidence in the record, however, that
claimant had prior experience as a clerical worker and was able to perform such
duties after mid-January 1986. Hence, the Board’s determination that claimant
was &quot;reasonably fitted&quot; and available for this type of employment was
supported by substantial evidence [<u>see</u>,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Levin
(Catherwood)</u>, 22 AD 2d 286,&nbsp;<u>appeal dismissed</u>&nbsp;15 NY 2d
1034]. We have considered the employer’s other contentions and find them also
to be without merit.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: Claimant
was employed as an assembler for a lighting manufacturer from September 1985
through October 11, 1988. She is a single parent with two young children. When
hired, she worked on the first shift, enabling her to be home with her
children. Eight months later due to lay-offs based on seniority, the claimant
was bumped to the third shift where she worked for about five months. She
continued to request reassignment to the first shift. The employer,
appreciating her family situation, transferred her back to the first shift at
the next opportunity, where she worked from December 1987 through May 1988.
However, there was another lay-off and the employer was required to reassign
claimant again, this time to the second shift from 3:30 p.m. to midnight. These
hours did not allow the claimant any time to be with her children as either she
was at work or they were in school. Her landlord looked in them while she was
at work. The employer was fully aware of her continuing problems with this
shift; however, it could do nothing because of the terms of its union contract.
The claimant continued to request an hope for reassignment to the first shift.
However, when further lay-offs on the first shift were implemented, dashing such
expectations, she resigned from her employment as the only way to be able to
spend any time with her children in the near future.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>: The
credible evidence establishes that the claimant was hired by the employer to
work on the first shift. Although she later worked for periods of time on the
second and third shift, she never accepted this condition of employment,
continuing to object to such assignment and seeking reassignment to the first
shift. She in fact was returned to the first shift for six months before being
transferred yet again to the second shift. We, therefore, conclude that the
fact that she did not immediately leave her employment upon assignment to the
second shift was not an acceptance of such condition of employment. It was a
reasonable effort by claimant to protect her employment while awaiting
reassignment to the first shift. However, when it became evident, following a
further lay-off, that an opening would not become available on the first shift
the claimant left her employment with good cause. The necessity that she, as a
sole parent, have some time with her young children gave her good cause to
leave her employment.</span></p>

claimant was employed as a trimmer in a handbag factory for approximately two
and a half years until April 18, 1988. She was scheduled to start work at 8:00
A.M. During the last months of her employment, claimant was warned about her
tardiness. All of the latenesses were due to transit delays. After being
advised by her employer to leave earlier in the morning in order to arrive on
time, the claimant did so. She allowed an hour and a half to one and ¾ hours
for travel time. On her last day of work, the claimant came in approximately
nine minutes late. This was caused (by) a fifteen-minute verified delay of the
train claimant took to work. The train also skipped the station at which
claimant needed to alight in order to go to her job site. If there were not a
transit delay, she would have arrived at her place of employment at the time
scheduled for her to start work. Her employer discharged the claimant because
of her pattern of lateness.</span></p>
