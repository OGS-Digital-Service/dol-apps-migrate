mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which claimant, her attorney, witnesses and representatives of the employers
and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a
designer, filed for benefits effective November 22, 1954. By initial
determination effective the same date, she was ruled ineligible because of lack
of total unemployment. She was ruled overpaid $180 and her benefits were ruled
to be forfeited for 24 effective days because of wilful false statements made
to obtain benefits. Prior to the filing in issue claimant was employed to
November 17 as a designer. After she lost her job she attempted to find other
employment. In applying to employers, it is customary for designers to submit
sketches to enable the employer to evaluate their work. In November and
December claimant applied to several employers. At one establishment, Fashion
Wear Dress Company, she discussed with the designer the possibility of selling
some of her sketches. No sales were made to that company by claimant. In the
early part of December she applied to another employer, Miss Cane, Inc. She
applied there because she learned that a designer who had been employed by that
employer had left. She was interviewed and requested to submit sketches. The
employer requested that she submit some sketches made specifically for it
pursuant to its suggestions. On December 13 claimant submitted 12 sketches. She
was told to submit additional sketches. On December 16 she submitted an
additional seven sketches. At the time claimant was requested to submit the
sketches she was told that she would be paid for the same at the rate of $3.50
per sketch. On December 16 when she brought the additional seven sketches to
the employer, she submitted bills, one dated December 13 for 12 sketches, for a
total of $42 and another bill dated December 16 for seven sketches totaling
$24.50. The total of the two bills was subsequently paid to her by check. On
December 23 she submitted five additional sketches and a bill for $17.50. This
was paid to her on December 27. During the period that claimant submitted the
sketches to Mss Cane, Inc., and received payment therefore, she certified to
total unemployment. She also completed insurance office questionnaire forms
indicating that she had not done any work during the period in question. She
contended that she did not consider that the sketches she prepared for the
employer and for which she was paid constituted work, because they were
submitted in connection with her application for employment. She further
contended that she would have made no claim for payment had the employer not
been willing to pay for the sketches; that they were submitted solely to
demonstrate to the employer her ability. The employer believed that the
sketches were submitted pursuant to an arrangement whereby it would pay for
them. During the entire period in issue commencing with November 22 claimant
sought full time employment. She did not hold herself out as a freelance
designer, but was willing to sell her design if anyone desired to purchase the
same. Any sketches she made during that period were made primarily to
demonstrate her ability to prospective employers rather than for the purchase
of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was totally
unemployed during the period that she claimed benefits, except during the
period when she prepared sketches for Miss Cane, Inc. and received payment for
such sketches. During the periods prior and subsequent thereto the sketches she
prepared were not made primarily for the purchase or sale, but to demonstrate
her ability to prospective employers. Claimant first submitted sketches
prepared specifically for that employer on December 13. At the time she
prepared the sketches she believed that she was doing to indicate her ability
to the employer. However, on December 13 she knew that she would be paid for
such sketches. She also knew that she would be paid for the additional sketches
requested by that employer. The work which she performed from December 13
through December 23 therefore constituted employment under the Unemployment
Insurance Law. Claimant was not totally unemployed during that period. Claimant
certified to total unemployment for the weeks ending December 19 and December
26 although she knew that she had done work specifically for one employer and
that she had been or would be paid for such work. It is not material that
claimant’s intention may not have been primarily to make the sale, but to
obtain employment. She knew that she had worked and would receive remuneration
for her work. It therefore follows that when claimant advised the insurance
office with respect to such periods that she had done no work, she
misrepresented. In order to find that the misrepresentation was wilful it is
not necessary to show that claimant understood the materiality of her
certification or representation. (<u>Matter of Bernstein</u>, 303 N.Y. 755,
affirming 278 App. Div. 625, reversing Appeal Board, 22,265-50.) It is perhaps
unfortunate that claimant did not realize that the work which she did for Miss
Cane, Inc., constituted employment under the Law. However, she knew that she
had performed work and had earnings, and it was therefore incumbent upon her to
advise the insurance office of this. Because of her failure to do so, the
insurance office was required to impose a forfeiture. The initial determination
of lack of total unemployment is modified to be effective from December 13
through December 23 and, as modified, is sustained. Claimant was overpaid only
for the weeks ending December 19 and December 26. The determination of wilful
misrepresentation is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The effect of the
referee’s decision is that claimant was not totally unemployed from December 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;through
December 23<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>1954; that claimant was overpaid for the weeks
ending December 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;an December 26, 1954, and that claimant
had wilfully misrepresented that she was totally unemployed, for which a
forfeiture of twenty-four effective days was imposed. Appellant contends that
she was totally unemployed during the period in question, was not overpaid, and
did not wilfully misrepresent. Claimant was a designer of women’s clothing. In
seeking employment as a designer, claimant made sketches and submitted them to
prospective employers as a sample of her work and ability, as was customary in
that field. Early in December 1954, claimant called upon a dress manufacturer,
Miss Cane, Inc., where she had heard there was no opening for a designer. At
the interview she exhibited some of her sketches, and was requested by the
President of Miss Cane, Inc., to submit additional sketches made specifically
for that company. On December 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;claimant submitted twelve
sketches which were accepted, and she was told that she would be paid therefore
and was requested to submit more. On December 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;claimant
submitted seven more sketches and two bills, one dated December 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;for
$42.00 and one dated December 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;for $24.40. On December 23<sup>rd</sup>,
pursuant to suggestion, she submitted five additional sketches and a bill for
$17.50. All of these bills were paid, and altogether claimant received from
Miss Cane, Inc., the sum of $84.00 for sketches which she had made upon
request. She was not employed as a designer by Miss Cane, Inc., then or later.
We think these transactions which resulted in remuneration of $84.00 paid to
claimant for work performed by her during a period of approximately two weeks
clearly provides the necessary substantial evidence to support a finding that
claimant was not &quot;totally unemployed&quot; during the period in question.
The statutory definition is: &quot;’Total unemployment’ means the total lack of
any employment on any day. The term ‘employment’ as used in this section means
any employment including that not defined in this title.&quot; (Labor Law,
§522). The last sentence is very broad. If it be deemed that claimant was not
in the employ of Miss Cane, Inc., under a contract of employment to make
sketches for a remuneration, she certainly was not totally unemployed. If it be
deemed that she was self-employed and merely sold the sketches to Miss Cane,
Inc., she likewise was not totally unemployed. &quot;Self-employment is clearly
work for profit; one who is cannot claim any unemployment insurance
benefits.&quot; (<u>Matter of Emery</u>&nbsp;[<u>Corsi</u>], 281 App. Div.
426). That portion of the decision which determines that claimant was not
totally unemployed and was overpaid during the period in question should be
upheld. The final part of the decision which imposes a forfeiture for wilfully
making a false statement or representation to obtain any benefit presents a
more difficult problem. Section 594 of the Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor
Law, Article 18), provides, in part: &quot;A claimant who has wilfully made a
false statement or misrepresentation to obtain any benefit under the provisions
of this article shall forfeit * * *.&quot; When claimant certified to total
unemployment for the week ending December 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and December 26,
1954, she made a false statement – or at least it has been so determined, and
we are upholding the determination. But was the false representation
&quot;wilfully&quot; made? It is without dispute that claimant was
conscientiously seeking full-time employment as a designer by a single employer
during all of the period involved. It is undisputed that the making and showing
of sketches was for the purpose of assisting her in obtaining such employment.
In other words, she was looking for a job – she was not selling sketches. She
did not get a &quot;job&quot; and had no &quot;job&quot; at the time she
reported her total unemployment. She testified that she did not regard the
incidental purchase of the sketches as employment. In fact, it does not appear
in the record that she had been paid for the sketches at the time she made the
misrepresentation. In such circumstances the every day understanding of the
common man should prevail, and we do not think that the ordinary individual who
was still looking for a job would regard himself as &quot;employed&quot; or
&quot;working.&quot; Claimant should not be held to a technical construction of
&quot;employment&quot; as it is used in the Unemployment Insurance Law. There
is no suggestion in the record of deliberate or intentional misrepresentation.
Indeed, the referee states in his decision: &quot;It is perhaps unfortunate
that claimant did not realize that the work, which she did for Miss Cane, Inc.
constituted employment under the Law.&quot; If she, in good faith, did not
&quot;realize&quot; it, then she did not knowingly or wilfully misrepresent.
Some element of scienter and knowledge of falsity or wrongfulness must be
present. We said nothing to the contrary in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Bernstein</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>),
(278 App. Div. 625, aff’d. without opinion 303 N.Y. 755). In that case we said
no &quot;criminal intent&quot; was required, and further: &quot;if a claimant
certifies to a false fact, knowing that it is false, the statute authorizes the
forfeiture, regardless of claimant’s interpretation of the ultimate effect of
his false statement.&quot; The&nbsp;<u>Bernstein</u>&nbsp;case is readily
distinguishable factually. There claimant returned to his usual job, for the
same employer who had laid him off two days before, and worked one day for
which he was paid $23.00. At the end of the week he certified that he suffered
total unemployment for the week. Here we do not think the record will sustain a
finding that claimant &quot;knew the statement was false.&quot; While
ordinarily the question of whether a false statement was wilfully made would be
one of fact, there appears to be nothing in this record to even permit an
inference that knowledge of falsity or the essential element of wilfullness
were present. The decision should be modified by reversing so much thereof as
determines that claimant made a wilful false statement and imposes a forfeiture
therefore, and, as so modified, the decision should be affirmed, with costs to
claimant-appellant, and the matter remitted for proceedings in accordance
herewith. (December 23, 1955)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, a salesperson of ladies’ coats, suits and dresses, refiled
for benefits effective March 23, 1953. By initial determinations effective May
18 she was ruled ineligible because of unavailability for employment and it was
ruled that she forfeit 24 effective days for a wilful false statement to obtain
benefits. Claimant was employed for six years, during the last part of which
she worked short-time, due to the inability of the employer to furnish her with
full-time employment. Short-time work is available during the busy season only.
On May 25 claimant was asked about her job efforts and was unable to advise the
insurance office where she had sought work. Beginning with May 26 claimant
sought employment throughout the balance of that week. She was interviewed on
May 29 for a job to which she was referred by the employment office and at
which she started working on June 2. On May 18 claimant advised the insurance
office that she had worked on May 17 and had earned $10 for such work. That
statement was false. Claimant had been ill on May 17 and had been unable to
report for work that day, although scheduled to do so. She advised the employer
of the reason for her failure to report for work. She told the insurance office
that she had worked on that day because she desired &quot;to disqualify
herself&quot; because she knew she was not eligible for benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Until May 26 claimant
did not seek employment and did not establish her presence in the labor market.
Since May 26 claimant has looked for work. She was hired following a job
application she made subsequent to that date. I therefore believe that until
May 26 claimant was unavailable and since May 26 she was available. There is no
dispute that the statement claimant made to the insurance office on May 18 that
she had worked on May 17 was false and it was known to her to be false.
However, it was her intention not to seek credit for that day because of her
illness, and that was the means she undertook to advise the insurance office of
her ineligibility for that a day. Section 594 of the Unemployment Insurance Law
provides for a forfeiture for a wilful misrepresentation&nbsp;<u>to obtain any
benefits</u>. Claimant did not seek to obtain benefits by her false statement.
Accordingly, no forfeiture for wilful misrepresentation should be
imposed.&nbsp;<u>Matter of Bernstein</u>, 278 App. Div. 625, 303 N.Y. 755,
rev’g. Appeal Board, 22,265-50, is distinguishable. The initial determination
of unavailability, as modified, is sustained. The initial determination of
wilful misrepresentation is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Appeal by the
Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board which affirmed that portion of the decision of a referee overruling the
initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner that claimant wilfully
made a false statement to obtain employment insurance benefits. Claimant
usually worked Saturdays and Sundays only. She reported to the local
unemployment insurance office on May 18, 1953 and reported that she had worked
on Sunday, May 17, 1953, and had earned $10 for that work. As a matter of fact
she did not work on that day, but had called her employer’s place of business
on that morning making this false statement because by so doing she was
disqualifying herself for benefits for that day. She was afraid that if she
stated that she was sick and did not work it would involve obtaining a doctor’s
certificate and other complications. The Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor Law
§594), provides: &quot;A claimant who has wilfully made a false statement or
representation to obtain any benefit under the provisions of this article shall
forfeit * * *.&quot; The forfeiture imposed by the Industrial Commissioner in
this case was for 24 effective days. Something more is required by the statute
than a wilful false statement. It must be made &quot;to obtain any
benefits.&quot; Certainly the false statement there was not made to obtain any
cash benefit, and we do not think the record discloses that it was made to obtain
any benefit. It was really made to disqualify her from benefits for the day
involved. We do not think that the false statement was made for the purpose
which the statute requires, or comes within the spirit or intent of the statute
necessary to work forfeiture. We do not hold that the false statement must be
made to obtain a cash benefit, and we certainly do not condone making any false
statement at all, but upon this particular record we do not think that a
forfeiture was authorized. Decision of the Unemployment Insurance appeal Board
affirmed, without costs (April 24, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and a witness for the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. A statement was submitted on behalf of the Industrial
Commissioner in lieu of an appearance. Claimant, a millman, filed a claim
effective September 12, 1955. Claimant last worked August 31. His place of
employment went on strike starting September 1. As of October 5, the strike had
not been terminated. Claimant stated at the hearing on October 31, that the
strike was still in progress and he has participated in the picketing of his
place of employment and expects to go back to his place of employment if and
when the strike is settled. He states he will go back no matter where he is
employed, when the strike is over. From the statement submitted by the
Industrial Commissioner, it appeared that claimant’s benefits were suspended
for seven weeks because of loss of employment due to an industrial controversy
and claimant is not contesting the issue on the strike. By initial
determination effective September 22, 1955, claimant was disqualified for
refusal of employment without good cause. On September 22 claimant was referred
to employment as a millman. The pay was $1.75 an hour for a 40-hour week. The
job was in a union shop. Claimant would have to join the union which is a
C.I.O. union. Claimant belongs to an A.F. of L. union. Claimant was hired to
start work September 23. He reported for work on September 23 but refused to
work, giving his excuse that he did not think he could do the work. He says
that he would have to operate a shaper and he could not make the cutting knives
for the machine. The employer reports the claimant stated he did not like the
dressing room. The employer stated he did not blame claimant since claimant had
worked in a beautiful shop with good working conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was offered the employment in issue, there was an industrial controversy or
strike going on in the establishment of his former employment which job he had
had for 17 years. Claimant was participating in the strike and expected to
return to the employment on settlement of the industrial controversy. During
this period, claimant must be deemed to have a job or at least not to be in the
labor market seeking employment elsewhere. He was given and accepted a
suspension of any benefit rights he had during the seven-week period. In the
first seven-week period, the strike was still in force. The suspension was
still in effect on September 22. Claimant may not be disqualified for refusal
to accept other employment during the seven-week suspension period because of
the strike. Since claimant was not claiming or entitled to any benefits during
this seven-week period, he could not be penalized for not taking other
employment. Claimant refused employment with good cause. The initial
determination is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     that a disqualification may be imposed, when the refusal occurs during a
     disqualification period for voluntary quit or, after the filing of a
     claim, during a period of suspension because of misconduct. There is a
     marked distinction from these cases in that a definite break in
     employer-employee relationship occurs when the separation is due to a
     voluntary quit or misconduct, whereas such relationship continues while an
     industrial controversy is in progress. Under such circumstances it may
     reasonably be said that the individual is not an applicant for benefits
     until a claim is again filed after the suspension terminates. Thus, the

     final disposition of that issue. Thus, the claimant would have clearly
     remained an applicant for benefits. It seems that under such circumstances
     an additional determination disqualifying the claimant for refusal of
     employment would have been proper.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant, a bakery sales
clerk, filed effective October 11, 1955. By initial determination effective
October 12 her benefits were suspended for seven weeks for loss of employment
through misconduct. Her benefits were further forfeited for 20 effective days
because of a wilful false statement to obtain benefits made on October 27. For
four and a half years to October 11, 1955 claimant worked for a bakery chain
store organization. On October 10 her hours of work were from 12 noon to 9 p.m.
The store manager went off duty at 5:30 p.m. but returned to the store at about
6 p.m. She remained in the store until about 7 p.m. Business was slack and
little merchandise remained to be sold. Claimant’s manager suggested to her that
she close the store and telephone her husband to call for them and drive them
home in his automobile. A rule of the company permitted the person in charge of
a store to close before the regular closing hour of 8:30 p.m. if there was no
further merchandise to be sold and upon obtaining the permission for such
closing from the district manager or manager. At 6:30 p.m. the manager had
taken a reading of the register which she entered in the time book as having
been taken at 7 o’clock p.m. At 7 o’clock p.m. claimant took the final reading
and indicated that she was going to enter that reading as of 7:30 p.m. The
manager instructed her to indicate such reading as having been made at 8:30
p.m. Claimant then phoned her husband and after she and the manager closed the
store he drove them to their homes. Shortly after 7 p.m. and again at 7:45 p.m.
the district manager telephoned the store and when he received no reply, went
there, arriving before 8 p.m. He found the store closed with a sign in the
window that all of its products had been sold out and that it would be opened
the following day. He entered the store and ascertained that there was some
merchandise remaining to be sold. He telephoned the manager at her home and she
informed him that she knew nothing of the store being closed. The manager then
phoned claimant at her home, advising her of the telephone call from the
district manager and her reply and instructed claimant to advise the district
manager the following day that she had been ill and that she had closed the
store early for that reason. On October 11 claimant went to the store and was
dismissed by the district manager when she said that she had closed the store
because she was ill and had been too ill to telephone the district manager to
advise him of that fact. The conversation took place in the presence of the
store manager who said nothing about having been present the evening before.
Claimant said nothing of the manager’s presence and instructions the evening
before because she did not believe that the employer would discharge her, and
she did not want to jeopardize the manager’s employment. On October 27 claimant
was interviewed in the insurance office and * * * she repeated her statement
that she had been alone in the store on October 10 and that she had closed
early because she was ill. On November 17 she signed another interview reciting
that she did not earlier advise that the manager had been present in the store
until it was closed because she did not believe it was necessary to mention that
fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Considering the facts
in the light most favorable to claimant we cannot concur in the conclusion
reached by the referee based thereon that claimant did not lose her employment
through misconduct in connection with her employment and that she did not
wilfully make a false statement on October 27, 1955 for the purpose of
obtaining benefits which he based upon the premises that claimant’s acts were
upon the instruction and consent of her supervisor and that her false statement
was not made to obtain benefits but to save her manager from possible
discharge. Claimant by admittedly closing the store while merchandise remained
to be sold and falsifying her employer’s time records to signify that she
closed the store at 8:30 p.m. and made sales to that time on October 10, 1955,
when in fact she left such establishment at 7 p.m. displayed a wanton disregard
of the employer’s interests and a breach of trust which justified her employer
in discharging her which constituted misconduct under the Law. Claimant’s
impropriety cannot be condoned because it was sanctioned by her immediate
supervisor, who also disregarded the interest of their employer. Furthermore
under the employer’s rules claimant herself was in charge of the store from six
until nine, not her supervisor, who was off duty. Under the facts and
circumstances of the present case, we believe that the local office properly
suspended the accumulation of benefit rights by claimant for seven consecutive
weeks effective October 12, 1955. Since claimant’s statements on October 27
that she was alone in the store and closed the store early because she was ill
were known to her to be false, she was also properly charged with having made a
wilful misrepresentation for the purpose of obtaining benefits. Even assuming
that the referee’s conclusion as to claimant’s motive for making the false
statements is correct, which is extremely doubtful (witness her subsequent
statement of November 17), nevertheless, a person must be presumed to intend the
necessary effects of his acts, and, if undetected, claimant’s false statement
might have had the effect of avoiding a suspension or disqualification and, to
that extent, of obtaining benefits for her. The amended initial determination
of the local office suspending the accumulation of benefit rights by claimant
for seven consecutive weeks effective October 12, 1955 on the ground that she
lost her employment through misconduct in connection with her employment and
the initial determination holding that she wilfully made a false statement on
October 27,1955 for the purpose of obtaining benefits for which a forfeiture of
20 effective days was imposed as a penalty are sustained. The decision of the
referee is reversed. (February 10, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was employed for several years as a busboy. He resumed employment on December
14 in the post office. On November 16 claimant was referred to employment as an
assembler of aluminum doors at $1.20 an hour. He went to the employer and was
hired. The employer advised claimant to obtain an examination from his
physician and to return the following day with the report. Claimant then
refused the job because the work was different from his last employment, he did
not wish to join another union and he did not desire to pay for the physical
examination. In the last employment claimant earned $1.27½ an hour. This was
unskilled work. In the job offered him he would be required to join the union

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We agree with the
conclusions of the referee that the employment offered claimant was one for
which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience within the meaning of
the Unemployment Insurance Law and that the wage offered to him was not
substantially less favorable than that prevailing for similar work in the
locality and that consequently the reasons advanced by claimant for refusing
the offer of employment on such grounds were untenable. We also concur in the
conclusion reached by the referee that claimant’s objection to joining a union
was not justifiable reason to decline the offer of employment inasmuch as it
was not shown that there would be any interference with his membership in
another union. However, claimant also refused the proffered employment on the
further ground that the employer required that he submit to a physical
examination by his own doctor for which he was to pay the medical bill as a
condition imposed for obtaining employment. In Appeal Board, 17,906-48 where
the claimant in that case advanced a similar reason for refusing employment
offered to him the Board held that he had good grounds for rejecting the proffered
employment because it was unjustifiable to make him pay for a physical
examination as a condition precedent to his obtaining the job. We, therefore,
hold that the instant claimant had good cause, within the meaning of the Law,
for refusing the offered employment for the reason indicated. The initial
determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits effective November 16, 1955 on the ground that, without good cause, he
refused employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience
is overruled. The decision of the referee is reversed. (February 10, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which claimant’s union representative and attorney and representatives of the
Industrial Commissioner and of the employer appeared. Testimony was taken.
Claimant, a marine electrician, filed for benefits at San Francisco, California
effective October 17, 1955. An initial determination was issued ruling claimant
eligible for benefits without disqualifying conditions. The employer protested,
requested a hearing and made the statutory deposit. Claimant was employed
aboard a vessel operated by the employer from 1942, until September 30, 1955,
on which date he requested and was granted a leave for vacation purposes in
accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and a union rule. The
agreement provided that all seamen who are employed continuously aboard a
vessel for 360 days are required to take a trip off for vacation purposes in
order to spread the work among the unemployed seamen to maintain a large labor
reservoir for the shipping industry. There were approximately 40,000 union
members to fill 23,000 jobs and unless a system for sharing the work were
adopted, many of the seamen who were unemployed, would leave the industry and
thereby create a critical shortage in the first line of defense in emergency
situations. Claimant was paid 38 days vacation pay from a pooled fund to which
the employer contributed $1.25 a man per day. His vacation payment was computed
on his average base rate during the vacation year and bore no relationship to
the amount of payment made by the employer. The payments made by the employer
were not earmarked for any specific individual but were placed in a pooled
fund. However, according to the union shipping rules then in existence,
claimant could not bid for any job coming into the union hall during the relief
trip unless he desired to sacrifice his job and obtain employment with another
contract employer. Claimant returned to work for his regular employer on
November 28 the next voyage of the vessel after the completion of the round
trip which started on October 1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the payment of benefits to claimant for the 38-day period for which he received
vacation pay from his union through the pooled fund and argued that for that
period, claimant was not eligible for benefits. The objection is well taken.
For the 28-day period of his vacation pay through October 28, claimant had
temporarily withdrawn from the labor market and consequently was ineligible for
benefits. However, commencing with October 29, claimant was under no disability
by his union rules from resuming employment with his employer. The only reason
he could not return to the vessel was because it was at sea due to
circumstances beyond his control. Claimant could obtain other employment by
registering at the union hiring hall provided he was willing to give up his
employment with his last employer. However, in view of the nature of the
shipping industry and shipping conditions at the present time, claimant could
not hope to reship prior to the time that he would be able to reship by waiting
for the return of his regular vessel. Accordingly, I find that claimant had
temporarily withdrawn from the labor market through October 28 but was
available thereafter. It follows that any benefits which claimant received
through October 28 constituted an overpayment. The initial determination of
eligibility, as modified, is sustained. Since the initial determination was
modified, the employer is entitled to a refund of its deposit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was employed for 21 months to August
5, 1955 as a controller-office manager. She has 11 years experience in that
classification. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective August 8, 1955
and registered for employment. On November 1, 1955 she invested $3,000 in a
corporation which operates a retail store selling gift items. Claimant became
vice-president and holder and owner of 50 percent of the issued stock. The
president of the corporation owns the remaining 50 percent of the issued stock
and devotes his full time to the business of the corporation. The store hours are
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Claimant devotes all day
Saturday and virtually every weekday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. to the store’s
business. Her duties consist of keeping the books for the corporation and
waiting on customers. Claimant is a signatory to the corporation’s checks. She
and the president agreed that they would draw no salaries from the business at
its inception. However, they further agreed that when business conditions
warranted they would draw equal amounts without regard to the number of hours
devoted to the business. Claimant restricted her search for employment to
positions paying $7,500 per annum. Based on an interview with the claimant the
local office issued initial determinations holding claimant ineligible to
receive benefits effective November 1, 1955 on the ground that she was not
totally unemployed and in the alternative, holding claimant ineligible to
receive benefits effective November 1, 1955 on the ground that she was
unavailable for employment and charging her with an overpayment of $36 in
benefits by reason thereof. Claimant protested the determinations and requested
a hearing before a referee. The referee overruled the initial determinations
and the Industrial Commissioner now appeals to the Board from the decision of
the referee insofar as it overrules that part of the initial determination
holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective November 1, 1955 on
the ground that she was not totally unemployed and the initial determination
holding that as a result thereof she was overpaid the sum of $36 in benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee overruled
that part of the initial determination of the local office holding that
claimant was not totally unemployed on the premise that she became a
stockholder and officer of the corporation for investment purposes only. The
referee further concluded that the amount of time she devoted to the business
was sporadic and limited. On the record we reach a different conclusion.
Claimant was an officer of the corporation and was empowered to sign checks on
its behalf. She devoted herself to the corporation’s business all day Saturday
and virtually every weekday from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The services which claimant
rendered were those of an active officer of a corporation. She spent a
considerable amount of time (about 20 hours a week) at the corporation’s
premises and rendered appreciable service in connection with its business. A
statement submitted on behalf of claimant on February 28, 1956 indicates that she
is still unemployed, a period of almost seven months. Although claimant
contends that she drew no salary and no proof that she did was offered,
nevertheless, claimant was in a position to have salary payments to herself
arbitrarily manipulated as to certain periods in order to enable her to qualify
for unemployment insurance benefits. It is significant that whereas claimant
testified that she and the president of the corporation drew no salaries at the
business’ inception, she further testified that if business conditions
warranted, she and the president would draw equal amounts. She stated that this
was so despite the fact that the president was engaged in the business on a
full time basis. We accordingly conclude that claimant was in a position at any
time to have payments made covering past services by causing payments for past
services or increases to be voted at a meeting called for that purpose. To
reason otherwise would permit claimant, the officer of a corporation rendering
substantial services, to circumvent the spirit and intent of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. Under all the circumstances herein, we are persuaded that
claimant was not totally unemployed. That part of the initial determination of
the local office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective
November 1, 1955 on the ground that she was not totally unemployed and the
initial determination holding that as a result thereof she was overpaid the sum
of $36 in benefits are sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (March
9, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

During the 20-day statutory period, within which time claimant could have
requested a hearing before a referee (Unemployment Insurance Law Section
620.1), she raised no objection thereto and did not request a hearing. Her
failure to act timely, foreclosed her from a hearing on the merits (Appeal

December 28, 1955 however, may be considered in relation to the determination
issued and mailed on December 22, 1955, since her request for a hearing insofar
as that determination is concerned was timely. However, the statement in the
determination, that the overpayment of $30 in benefits resulted from the
previous initial determination of her refusal of employment without good cause,
was merely explanatory, designed to inform the claimant of the basis and reason
for the overpayment as charged. It neither revised the original initial
determination nor revived it. Although the referee had jurisdiction to render a
decision on the merits as to the determination of overpayment, the scope of
such decision may be limited to the issues of whether or not claimant was in
fact overpaid any benefits and the amount thereof (Appeal Board, 49,687-55).
Since claimant does not contend that she did not receive the benefits charged
as an overpayment or that the amount thereof is incorrect, it follows that the
determination mailed on December 22, 1955 must be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant, her witness and union representative, and representatives of
the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a sewing machine
operator, refiled for benefits effective March 15, 1954. By initial
determination effective March 26, she was disqualified for refusal of
employment without good cause, and ruled overpaid $98. On March 26, claimant
obtained employment on a piecework basis in a shop which was under contractual
relations with her union. She was being paid union piecework rates. The
industry is about 90% organized. A normal day’s work in the employer’s
establishment was 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Claimant started work at 8:30 a.m. on
March 26. At about 11 a.m. she decided to quit because she was dissatisfied
with her earnings. She continued working until (about) noon and then quit
before going to lunch. She did not complain to her union about the piecework
rate before quitting, nor did she have any immediate prospect of other
employment when she left the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seem to us to be unequivocal findings that claimant did not refuse, but rather
accepted, employment. Whether a job is kept a full day instead of a half-day or

two days by a subcontractor engaged in furnishing the carpentry work in the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Malaspina</u>, 285 App. Div. 564 reversing Appeal Board, 42,606-54, it was held
that an employee who refused to join a union within 60 days after the date of
hiring, as provided in the agreement between the union and the employer, and
who was discharged because of that refusal was deemed to have left his
employment voluntarily without good cause. The Court stated that this was
equivalent to an election by the employee not to meet a condition of the
employment. Under the Fair Labor Management Act of 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act)
union membership may be required on or after the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;day of
employment if there is a union agreement to that effect. The Act also provides
that it is an unfair labor practice to demand immediate membership prior to the
expiration of 30 days. Accordingly, it was held that where such immediate
membership was demanded, a disqualification for refusal of such employment
could not be sustained. (Appeal Board, 34,937-52, 34,877-52.) The question then
to be determined is whether the employment herein constitutes interstate
commerce sufficient to come within the jurisdiction of the National Labor
Relations Law or is controlled by the New York Labor Law which contains no
prohibition against the closed shop or the immediate requirement that an
employee become a member of a union as a condition of obtaining or retaining
employment. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Dennely Construction Company</u>, 111 N.L.R.B.
180, 35 L.R.R.M. 1640, jurisdiction was accepted by the National Labor
Relations Board in a case involving the operations of a general contractor.
Authority for including a local subcontractor within the jurisdiction of the
Federal act has not been discovered. Therefore, this employer, providing only
labor to the construction project, was not engaged in interstate commerce and
the employment was subject to the State Labor Law and not subject to the
Federal Act. Section 704 of the Labor Law provides that an employer is not
precluded from making an agreement with a bona fide labor organization

Centre Street to report a failure of a previous employer to pay her two-weeks
salary. She arrived at that building at about 10:30 a.m. and left about 2 p.m.
She could have reported at the insurance office either before or after she
visited the State Labor Department Building. She would have reported to the
insurance office on Saturday or Sunday, March 17 and March 18, but did not
because the office was closed. She was available for employment on those days.
She did not report to the insurance office on March 19 because of weather
conditions. She telephoned the insurance office and she was excused for not
reporting on that day. She next reported to the insurance office on March 20.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant advanced no tenable reason for not reporting to the insurance office
as required on March 16, 1956, she was properly held ineligible to receive
benefits for that day because of her failure to comply with reporting
requirements. Inasmuch as claimant’s failure to report at the local office on
March 19 was excused by the local office due to the severity of the weather,
the only issue left is whether claimant should be charged with a failure to
report at the local office on March 17 and 18, 1956, at which time the local
office was closed. We are not in accord with the referee’s reason for excusing
claimant’s failure to report on these days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>A careful reading of
this provision fails to justify the interpretation, which has been placed
thereon by the referee. He ruled that this section referred to those days when
claimant failed to report at the local office due to her own fault or
negligence. In our opinion such interpretation of the section is not
permissible. It must be remembered that claimant was required to report on
March 16, 1956. Had she done so, the question of whether or not she was to be
penalized as to the days intervening until her next reporting would have
arisen. Inasmuch as she is chargeable with a failure to report on March 16 she
is likewise to be charged with the consequences which flow from her failure to
report on that date. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the above
quoted paragraph of Regulation 41, claimant may not receive credit for the
intervening Saturday and Sunday, which were admittedly days of unemployment. We
are of the opinion therefore, that the revised initial determination was correct
and that the referee erred in modifying same by limiting it to the one day of
March 16, 1956.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the referee stated that Appeal Board, 22,241-50, cited by the Industrial
Commissioner, was not applicable to the facts in this case because it presented
a different factual situation. However, a question similar to that before us
was presented to the Board in Appeal Board, UCV224-56. In that case, the
claimant failed to report to the employment office on Friday, December 23 and
next reported on Tuesday, December 27. There intervened a Saturday, Sunday and
Christmas Day, which was celebrated on Monday, December 26. The Board reversed
the referee’s modification of the initial determination of the local office in
that case and held that claimant was not entitled to be credited with the
intervening Saturday, Sunday and Monday pursuant to the provisions of
Regulation 42.c. of the Industrial Commissioner. That regulation is similar to
Regulation 41.3, except that it refers to a failure to report at the employment
office instead of at the local office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tapering down, by refraining from soliciting or accepting ship repair work
other than short-term jobs, and by advising some of its customers that it might
not be able to guarantee timely completion of jobs. * * *In the meantime, the
employer and the union engaged in collective bargaining to reach a new
agreement. The negotiations commenced June 3 and terminated Saturday, September
18 after about 25 sessions, when a new agreement was drafted and initialed by

completed until the following week and formal execution and delivery of the document

were in the affirmative, the union team was not vested thereby with power to

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant’s
employment in the employer’s ship repair yards was under the terms of a union
contract expiring June 23, 1954. The union gave sixty day’s prior notice of
intent to terminate the contract and to renegotiate as of that expiration date.
Negotiations at two meetings held prior to that time were unsuccessful. On June
23 the union advised the employer, in writing, that no strike would be called
prior to July 23 or, in any event, without fifteen days’ prior notice. On July
7 the union served notice of its intention to call on its members to strike on
July 23 and by votes taken at subsequent meetings of local unions the union
negotiating committee was authorized to call a strike. Such action was,
however, subject to final authorization by the president or executive board of
the international union, which was not given or, so far as appears, applied
for. On July 23, the union issued to its members leaflets stating that work, as
well as negotiations, would continue on a day-to-day basis, the employer and employees
continuing to observe the terms of the expired contract and no strike to occur
until the general executive board should be convinced that there would be no
usefulness in continuing negotiations. On September 18 the negotiating teams
reached an agreement which was subsequently ratified. Work and negotiations
alike did proceed during all the period in question, peacefully and without
incident except that on two occasions certain shifts left work early, on the
first occasion to vote on the proposal to authorize a strike and, later, to
vote on the proposed new contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer laid off workers in substantial numbers and has offered proof claimed
to substantiate its contention that such layoffs were necessitated by a
shortage of work which was, in turn, due to its, as well as its prospective
customers’, apprehension as to delays in performance which would ensue upon a
strike. As early as June 9 the employer began to advise prospective customers
as to what it termed the strike threat and to solicit work which could be
completed quickly or without penalty by way of demurrage, if delayed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seven weeks from the day after loss of employment &quot;because of a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy&quot;. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board has found that neither occurred. In our view, there was substantial

subsequent authorization conferred upon the negotiating committee, but neither
acted upon by the committee nor ratified by the international union the board
was entitled to weigh the evidence that the available work continued without
any significant interruption or other incident and that the contract
negotiations proceeded peacefully and to a successful conclusion. Upon thus
weighing the proof, the board was entitled to find, as it did, that no strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy existed. In affirming that basic
finding, we do not adopt the unnecessary expressions of opinion which followed
it in the referee’s decision, which the board adopted, characterizing the
collective bargaining negotiations as &quot;the antithesis of a strike, lockout
or other controversy&quot;, nor do we approve the further and again unnecessary
conclusion that the initial denial of benefits to workers laid off by reason of
the employer’s anticipation of a strike was unjustified because no strike
eventuated. We are satisfied from our reading of the board’s decision that its
findings were based upon the entire record and are amply sustained by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

properly applied the principle expressed in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Cohen</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>),
283 App. Div. 143. There the employer properly elected to negotiate a new
working arrangement, as the employees did here. There, as here, employees were
laid off while negotiations proceeded peacefully until a new contract was
concluded. &quot;This&quot;, we said, &quot;is not what the Legislature meant
by ‘strike, lockout or other industrial controversy’ which, read together, must
open to the construction that the ‘other industrial controversy’ intended was
something in the nature of a strike or lockout. The purpose of the statue as
Presiding Justice Foster observed in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Burger</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>)
(277 App. Div. 234, 236) (affd, 303 N.Y. 654) is that the State is to step
aside for a time, pending the settlement of the differences between employer
and employee ‘to avoid the imputation that a strike may be financed through
unemployment insurance benefits.’&quot; In this case reasons at least equally
strong forbade the application of pressure by denial of benefits while
bargaining was carried on peacefully and in good faith and without act or
incident found, upon the factual situation as a whole, to have been in the
nature of a strike or lockout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

or with the board’s determination here. There, negotiations had failed, a
strike was called and temporarily deferred only by reason of an executive order

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Adhering, as we do, to
the principle and the incidental definition stated in the&nbsp;<u>Cohen</u>&nbsp;case,&nbsp;<u>supra,</u>&nbsp;we
refrain from an extended discussion of appellant’s contention that the term
&quot;other industrial controversy&quot; is synonymous with &quot;labor
dispute&quot;, as used in other state and federal enactments, with the effect,
in appellant’s view, of broadening the application of the former. In
particular, appellant would apply to &quot;other industrial controversy&quot;
the definition specifically applied by subdivision 10(c) of section 876-a of
the Civil Practice Act to the term &quot;labor dispute&quot; appearing
elsewhere in that section, relating to injunctions issued in labor disputes. It
seems clear that the definition prescribed by a statute for words used in that
particular statute does not necessarily govern the construction of those same
words, to say nothing of words merely similar, as they may appear in other
acts, and, in fact, the reasons necessitating such a definition in a particular
instances may some times militate against the general application of that
definition. Nevertheless we do not consider the resolution of this semantic
controversy necessary to a proper analysis of the authorities above reviewed or
to our determination of the issues. Dealing with a similar contention raised in
the&nbsp;<u>Aragan</u>&nbsp;case,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>, the court said, &quot;we
need not determine whether ‘labor dispute’ must in all cases be construed as
broadly as it is defined in the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the National Labor

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A combined hearing was
held at which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a shipping supervisor, filed for benefits on
March 14 effective March 12, 1956. An initial determination was issued which
ruled claimant ineligible for benefits because he had no covered employment in
the base year, March 14, 1955 to March 11, 1956, which was established on the
above filing. Claimant requested that his claim be predated to January 2, 1955.
This request was denied and an initial determination was issued ruling claimant
ineligible for failure to comply with registration requirements from January
29, 1955 to March 11, 1956. Claimant was employed by a department store
organization for 31 years until January 1955. He was a supervisor in his
employer’s warehouse. For some time prior to the end of January negotiations
took place between claimant and his employer concerning the termination of
claimant’s job. Claimant believed his last day of work was January 28, 1955. He
received his semi-monthly pay at the end of January. This included one month
vacation pay. It was known to claimant at the time of his separation that his
employer intended to pay him one year’s pay. This payment was made in a lump
sum. Claimant had no experience with the unemployment insurance program. During
the first half of February 1955, he telephoned the Jamaica office of the
Division of Employment in order to obtain information concerning the filing of
a claim for benefits. He had not received any forms or instructions concerning
this from his employer at the time of his separation from his job. During the
course of the telephone call to the insurance office, claimant was required to
repeat his inquiry to three successive staff members. He explained that he had
been laid off and that he had received or was to receive one year’s salary and
asked what to do about applying for unemployment insurance. He was told to make
his claim after the year would expire. He specifically asked if it was
necessary for him to report to the insurance office at that time and offered to
do so, but was told that this was not necessary. There was no reason why
claimant could not have promptly reported to the insurance office. He did not
do so only because of his reliance upon the instructions, which were given to
him. Claimant is 62 years of age. He had no intention of abandoning employment.
He had independently instituted steps to secure work even prior to making the
telephone inquiry of the insurance office in the first half of February. He
thereafter continued his job-seeking efforts by applying to employment agencies
and by applying to prospective employers and by negotiating with employers not
only in New York City, but elsewhere. He continued to be ready, willing, and
able to accept work throughout 1955. Claimant intended to report to the
insurance office to file a claim in early February 1956, when the year to which
the payment applied would expire. He was ill for a number of weeks during February
and for this reason did not report to the insurance office until March 14. The
$5000 paid to claimant by the employer was a voluntary dismissal wage. Claimant
was not subject to call by the employer after the end of January 1955, and was
not required to, nor did he, render any services of any nature whatsoever for
the employer subsequent to the end of January 1955.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant performed no
services during the base period Mach 14, 1955 to March 11, 1956. The payment,
which he received from his employer after the termination of his employment,
was a dismissal payment and was excluded from the definition of remuneration.
(Section 517.2(I).) Claimant, therefore, failed to meet the requirements of a
valid original claim with respect to the filing which was made effective March
12, 1956. Although it was testified that it is contrary to the established
procedures and policy which govern the operation of the insurance offices for
information to be given by telephone, the credible evidence convinces me that
claimant failed to report to the insurance office and to personally register
his claim for benefits during the first half of February 1955, solely because
of his reliance upon instructions which were given to him that it was not necessary
for him to report to the insurance office until a year elapsed. Claimant was
able to report to the insurance office and would have done so if any indication
had been given to him that this was required, necessary or desirable. The
quality of claimant’s testimony was such that it far outweighs the evidence
offered on behalf of the Industrial Commissioner, which consisted of a general
reference to the established policies of the insurance office. Since claimant
had a valid reason for not reporting to the insurance office during 1955,
following the termination of his employment, the initial determination denying
his request for a predating of his claim is overruled. This matter is referred
to the insurance office for the ascertaining of a benefit rate for claimant
based upon such a filing. The initial determination of ineligibility based upon
the filing effective March 12, 1956 is sustained. The initial determination
denying claimant’s request for a predating of his claim is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due deliberation having
been had thereon, and having found that the referee’s findings of fact and
conclusions of law are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that
no errors of fact or law appear to have been made, the Board adopts the
findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the referee as the findings
of fact and conclusions of law of this Board, except that we find that the
record does not support claimant’s contention that he telephoned the insurance
office in February of 1955 and was advised by a representative of the
Industrial Commissioner, in answer to an inquiry, that he was ineligible to receive
benefits until after a year would expire (period represented by the one year’s
salary which he received from his employer in a lump sum) and that it was
unnecessary for him to report at the local office. We do not adopt the
referee’s findings to that effect. The Board is of the opinion that the referee
made proper findings of fact and correctly determined the issue involved in
this case; except as above stated. Claimant offered no valid reasons for
predating his claim. He bases his contention on an alleged telephone
conversation with an unidentified person in the insurance office. Such
information, had it been given, would have been contrary to the regulations of
the Industrial Commissioner. Accordingly, we find that there is no evidence of
probative value in this case to substantiate claimant’s contention that he was
misinformed by a representative of the local office and thus to overcome the
presumption of regularity as to compliance with proper office procedure.
Claimant’s request to predate his claim was properly denied. The initial
determinations of the local office (1) denying the request of claimant to
predate his claim from March 12, 1956 to January 29, 1955 and holding that he
was ineligible to receive benefits effective January 29, 1955 through March 11,
1956 on the ground that he failed to comply with registration requirements and
(2) holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective March 12, 1956 on
the ground that he did not file a valid original claim in that he did not have
at least 20 weeks of covered employment in his base period, are sustained. The
decision of the referee is modified accordingly, and, as so modified, is
affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a carpenter-apprentice, was employed
by a construction company for approximately seven months to October 1955. He
had been hired under a program of the State Apprenticeship Council pursuant to
which he would qualify as a journeyman-carpenter after four years. He was paid
$1.75 an hour with the construction company. He was laid off because of a lack
of work. Claimant is a war Veteran, 24 years old, who was discharged from the
military service because of a disability involving his arm. He is unable to do
heavy labor work. His disability is rated at 50 percent by the Veterans’
Administration. Claimant filed an original claim for benefits effective October
31, 1955 and registered for employment. Claimant’s employer indicated on a
notice of experience rating charges mailed to it on February 16, 1956, relating
to the payment of benefits to claimant for the week ending January 29,1956,
that claimant &quot;refused to come back to work&quot;. Based upon a report by
telephone from the employer that claimant’s refusal to return to work occurred
either in November or December 1955 the local office issued initial
determinations disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits effective
December 27, 1955 on the ground that without good cause he refused employment
for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience, and charging him
as a result thereof with overpayments of benefits totaling $396. Based on a
statement by claimant on January 27, 1956 to the effect that he had not refused
any jobs during the period for which he was claiming benefits the local office
issued an initial determination holding that claimant wilfully made a false
statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits, for which a forfeiture of 24
effective days against his future benefit rights was imposed as a penalty.
Claimant protested the initial determinations and requested a hearing. The
referee overruled all of the foregoing initial determinations and the
Industrial Commissioner appealed to the Board. The employer's offer to
re-employ claimant was made at sometime prior to January 27, 1956. He was
informed that he would have to do laboring work if necessary and that it would
be heavier work than that usually performed by carpenter-apprentices. Claimant
refused to accept the offer of re-employment because he had found that labor
work, which he had occasionally performed during slow periods when there was no
carpentry work available, affected his arm, in which he has a plate to replace
a missing bone. On January 27, 1956 claimant stated that he had no refused
employment because he thought that only the offer of work identical to that
previously performed required an affirmative answer to the question on the
Unemployment Insurance office form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee ruled that
claimant refused employment with good cause since he was offered heavy labor
work which he is unable to do. The Board agrees with this portion of the
referee’s decision. The referee resolved the ambiguity in the record as to the
date on which the refusal of employment occurred by fixing the same as January
30, 1956 and consequently overruled the initial determination holding that
claimant wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits
when he stated on January 27, 1956 that he had not refused employment. The date
on which the refusal occurred would be immaterial were the only issue in the
case refusal of employment, since the record supports the conclusion that the
refusal was with good cause. The date on which the refusal occurred is however
of importance in connection with the issue of wilful misrepresentation, since
if the date be prior to January 27, 1956, rather than as found by the referee,
the initial determination of wilful misrepresentation was properly issued by
the local office. A careful analysis of all of the evidence in the record
convinces us that the date on which claimant refused the offer of re-employment
cannot be fixed with certainty. The employer’s testimony on this subject is
contradictory. He stated that he was not sure of the date, that it occurred
about Christmas time, and that &quot;it could be the second or third week in
January&quot;. Claimant’s testimony on this subject is equally unsatisfactory.
He stated that he was not sure of the dates and that he thought the employer
&quot;called me up at the end of February.&quot; It is obvious that the
selection by the referee of January 30, 1956 as the date of refusal was
arbitrary, as was the date of December 27, 1955, which was selected by the
local office. Although the date of refusal cannot be fixed with certainty, the
record is clear that it occurred at some time prior to January 27, 1956 when
claimant certified at the local office that he had not refused employment. An analysis
of his testimony indicates that he answered the question in the negative
because it was his belief that an affirmative answer was called for only in the
event he had been offered employment involving the same duties as previously
performed by him. This indicates that the refusal of employment had already
taken place at the time claimant furnished contrary information. Claimant was
obligated to supply truthful information and was not at liberty to speculate as
to the ultimate legal effect of the underlying facts (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Bernstein</u>, 303 N.Y. 755, affirming 278 App. Div. 625, reversing Appeal
Board, 22,265-50). Claimant knew that he was stating something to be a fact,
which was not the fact, and he did so for the purpose of obtaining benefits.
The initial determination imposing a forfeiture of 24 effective days was
correctly issued by the local office. The initial determination of the local
office disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits effective December 27,
1955 on the ground that without good cause he refused employment for which he
is reasonably fitted by training and experience and that part of the initial
determination charging him with overpayments of $396 in benefits are overruled.
That part of the initial determination of the local office holding that
claimant wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits
and imposing a forfeiture of 24 effective days against his future benefit
rights as a penalty therefore is sustained. The decision of the referee is
modified to accord with the foregoing and, as so modified, is affirmed. (July
20, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ill. She died on August 28, 1954 and funeral services were held on August 31,
1954. Claimant next reported at the local office on September 8, 1954. He was

unavailable for employment. The referee overruled all of the foregoing initial

insofar as this appeal is taken therefrom. It affirmatively appears that
claimant was unable to work during the period in issue. It is therefore our
conclusion that the very circumstances which justified excusing his failure to
report at the local office (the necessity of being with his sister and making
arrangements in connection with her funeral) rendered him unavailable for
employment within the meaning of the Law (See Section 591.2 Unemployment
Insurance Law).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hearing before the referee that the referee was without jurisdiction to rule
upon the issue of availability which was tendered for the first time at the
hearing and that the authority to issue initial determinations rested
exclusively with the local office. These objections are without merit. It was
not argued, nor indeed could it be that claimant was prejudiced in meeting the
additional issue, since it was based on the same facts which gave rise to the
issuance of the initial determination concerning his failure to report at the
local office. The Industrial Commissioner is of necessity constrained to act
through agents and employees. It has long been customary for such agents and
employees, at hearings before referees, to supplement or amend initial
determinations already issued by the local office, in proper cases. We perceive
no valid reason for interfering with such customary usage, deemed necessary by
the Industrial Commissioner to efficient administration of the Law. No new
facts were adduced before the referee that were not already known to claimant.
The amendment offered by the Industrial Commissioner’s hearing representative
was merely an additional determination based on the same facts. The referee was
therefore empowered to rule upon the issue of availability, which was
introduced at the hearing. His ruling thereon was erroneous for the reasons
herein above set forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant, her witness, and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a merrow-machine operator, filed for benefits
effective December 5, 1955. By initial determination, she was ruled ineligible
on March 22 and March 23 because she was not totally unemployed. By initial
determination effective March 26, she was disqualified for refusal of
employment without good cause. She was ruled overpaid $46.50 in benefits. Her
benefits were ruled to be forfeited for 24 effective days because of wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits. On March 20 the employment office
referred claimant to a job for which she was to apply on the following day, and
she was instructed to report back to the employment office on March 22. She
applied for the job on March 21 as instructed, and was told to report for work
the following day. Claimant did not report to the employment office on March 22
because she worked on that day and on the following day. During the afternoon
of March 23 she reported to the employment office and stated that she had
worked three days and left the job because she was dissatisfied with her
earnings. The employment office referred claimant to another job with
instructions to report to the employer on the following Monday, March 26. This
employer informed the employment office that claimant failed to report.
However, claimant testified, and I find, that she did apply for the job and
returned each day until April 2 at the employer’s request to see whether there
would be work for her. On April 2 the employment office referred her to another
job. When claimant reported to the insurance office on April 2 there were entries
in her insurance booklet showing that she was unemployed on each day during the
statutory week ending March 25. These entries were made by one of claimant’s
daughters. Claimant has a limited knowledge of the English language. She
testified, and I find, that she told her daughter that she work on March 22 and
March 23. On December 13, 1955, claimant had been interviewed at the insurance
office in connection with reporting several days of employment a few weeks
earlier. At that time it was explained to her that her insurance booklet must
be marked to show on which days she worked. This interview was conducted with
the aid of an interpreter whom claimant had brought to the insurance office
with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was
ineligible for benefits on March 22 and March 23 since she worked on those two
days. As a result, she was overpaid in benefits. The credible evidence
establishes that claimant did not refuse employment on March 26. She applied
for the job and continued to report to the employer until the employment office
gave her another referral. It was contended on behalf of the Industrial
Commissioner that claimant’s benefits were subject to forfeiture under Section
594 of the Unemployment Insurance Law because she failed to report that she
worked on March 22 and March 23. However, the fact that claimant furnished
incorrect information to the insurance office is not, in and of itself,
sufficient to establish the wilful misrepresentation. It must further be shown
that she knew the information she furnished was incorrect. (<u>Matter of Bunzl</u>,
1 App. Div. 2d 46, modifying Appeal Board 50,401-55). The credible evidence
establishes that claimant was unaware of the fact that her daughter had made
incorrect entries in the insurance book. This conclusion is supported by the
fact that claimant reported this employment to the employment office. Appeal
Board 53,475-55 is therefore inapplicable. In that case, it was held that
previous notification to the employment office did not excuse a false
certification at the insurance office. However, in the instant case claimant
did not knowingly make a false certification. The instant case is also
distinguishable from those cases in which the appeal Board held claimant
chargeable with the entries made in his insurance booklet by another person.
(Appeal Board 51,489-55 and 52,998-55.) In those cases there was no indication
that the claimant had made any effort to furnish correct information. In the
present case claimant did not conceal her employment, but discussed it at the
employment office. Her insurance booklet showed that there had been a job
referral and that claimant had reported late to the employment office. This
case involves an inadvertent error resulting solely from claimant’s language
handicap. The initial determination of total unemployment is sustained. The
other initial determinations are overruled. The overpayment should be
recomputed by the insurance office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due deliberation having

no errors of fact or law appear to have been made, the Board adopts the
findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the referee as the findings

The Board makes the additional findings of fact: On March 26, 1956
(inadvertently stated in the referee’s decision as April 2, 1956), claimant
reported to the insurance office that she was unemployed on each day in the
statutory week ending March 25 as noted in her insurance booklet. The entries
in the insurance booklet for the week ending March 25 were made by one of
claimant’s daughters due to the fact that claimant had limited knowledge of the
English language. The improper entries were made by the daughter after she had
been informed by claimant that she had worked on March 22 and 23. On the same
day claimant certified for benefits for the week ending March 25. The Board is
of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and correctly
determined the issues involved in this case, as modified and supplemented
herein, except as to the initial determination relating to claimant’s wilful
misrepresentation. The record shows that claimant was employed on March 22 and
March 23 and that claimant was aware of this fact at the time she reported to
the insurance office on March 26 and certified that she was totally unemployed
for that week. Under such circumstances the Board must conclude that claimant
wilfully made a false statement to obtain benefits within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. The fact that claimant disclosed to the employment
service her employment on the days in question and the fact that claimant
relied on the assistance of her daughter in marking the insurance booklet does
not affect the falsity of the statement (See appeal Board, 53,475-55; 52,998-55
and 51,489-55). The initial determination of the local office holding that
claimant wilfully made a false statement to obtain benefits for which a
forfeiture of 24 effective days in reduction of claimant’s future benefit
rights was imposed as a penalty is sustained. The decision of the referee
insofar as appealed from is modified accordingly and, as so modified, is
affirmed. (August 3, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee in overruling the initial
determination concluded that claimant was not reasonably fitted by training and
experience for the offered employment. The referee further stated that the
employer offered claimant a salary substantially less than that quoted by the
employment service. Although claimant lacks a degree, in view of his varied
experience extending approximately 15 years, we hold he was reasonably fitted
by training and experience for the offered employment. Although he lacked the
precise experience preferred by the prospective employer, his general
experience in the electronics field was acceptable to the employer. The
referral was made at a salary ranging from $6,000 to $6,500 per year. Because
he did not have acoustical experience, claimant was offered $115 a week by the
employer. This amount to $5,980 annually, and is not substantially less than
the minimum figure quoted. Because of certain characteristics of the occupation
in question, obtaining of reliable prevailing wage information is not feasible.
Therefore, in the absence of competent evidence as to prevailing rate, the
wages earned by the claimant in previous employments may be some indication of
the prevailing rate for a person with his qualification at the time of the
offer (Appeal Board, 12,852-46). From July 1955 to the date of the refusal of
the employment in question he held two jobs in each of which he earned $120
weekly. Prior to that he earned $135 a week for a two-week period. The salary
involved in the job offer in question bore a reasonable relationship to
claimant’s demonstrated earning capacity. Upon all the circumstances herein, we
held that claimant, without good cause, refused employment for which he is
reasonably fitted by training and experience, is sustained. The decision of the
referee, insofar as appealed from is reversed. (August 24, 1956).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

overruled the refusal disqualification on the premise that since claimant had
two and a half years' experience as a short-time worker, the fact that she most
recently worked full time for seven months, under the circumstances in this
case does not disqualify claimant as a short-time worker. We are unable to
agree with the referee's conclusion. Since claimant had worked recently
full-time for a substantial period, it cannot be said that she
&quot;customarily works less than the full-time prevailing&quot; in her place
of employment. (See Section 596.5 of the Unemployment Insurance Law). At the
time of filing for benefits, claimant did not qualify as a short-time worker
under the Law. We hold, therefore, that her reason for refusing a full-time job
on this sole ground was without god cause. In view of the conclusion reached by
us, it is unnecessary to pass on the alternative initial determination. The
initial determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits effective June 18, 1956 on the ground that, without good cause, she
refused employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training and
experience is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed (10/11/56)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

held that a claimant who for health reasons performed part-time work for
approximately six months prior to the filing for benefits was a
&quot;short-time&quot; worker (Index No. 755d.5; A-750-919). A comparison with

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which claimant and
representative of the employer and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. Claimant, a taxi driver, filed effective July 2, 1956. By
initial determination effective July 1, his benefits were suspended for seven
weeks for loss of employment through misconduct. He was further ruled
ineligible to accumulate more than one effective day per week, effective July 2
through July 5, and ruled ineligible because of unavailability for employment
by initial determination effective August 5. For about 15 years claimant worked
for a taxicab company. In 1952 he suffered a heart attack and since then worked
three or four days per week. On June 25, 1956, he was involved in an accident
resulting in personal injuries, and telephoned the employer shortly after the
accident to report it. The employer's rules require reporting such accidents
immediately. Claimant made the telephone call as soon after the accident as he
could locate a telephone. He was instructed to return to the garage and did so.
He was then sent to the insurance company to file an accident report. He worked
on June 30, but on July 2 was advised by an official of the employer that his
employment was terminated at the insistence of the insurer. Thereafter,
claimant looked for work for three or four days per week. Most of the taxicab
companies require working five days per week. Since August 6 he has made very
little effort to secure work as his condition requires him to rest frequently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that claimant's employment was terminated at the insistence of the employer's

claimant. Since he is only able to work at most four days per week, he can only
accumulate one effective day of unemployment per week. However, his efforts to
secure such work since August 6 have been so extremely limited as to offer no
reasonable probability of his securing employment. The initial determination of
loss of employment through misconduct is overruled. The other initial
determinations are sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the referee dated August 27, 1956. The Industrial Commissioner appeals from
said decision solely for the purpose of correcting the referee's findings of
fact as to the effective day of two separate initial determinations of the
local office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective July 2
and August 6, 1956 (erroneously stated by the referee to be August 5, 1956)
respectively, because he was unavailable for employment. Claimant appeals from
said decision insofar as it rules that claimant was ineligible to receive
benefits effective July 2 through July 5, 1956 on the ground that he was
unavailable for employment, in that his restriction to employment of no more
than four days per week prevented him from accumulating more than one effective
day per week, and also insofar as it sustains the initial determination of the
local office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective August
6, 1956 because he was unavailable for employment, in that he did not
diligently seek employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the referee
as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of this Board except as
hereinafter stated: The referee's finding that the initial determination of
unavailability based on claimant's restriction to employment of no more than
four days a week was made effective July 2 through July 5, 1956 was inaccurate;
it was made effective July 2, 1956, to continue for an indefinite period
thereafter. The Board finds that claimant was a short-time worker within the
meaning of Section 596.5 of the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Board is of the
opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and correctly determined
the issue involved in this case, except as hereinabove and hereinafter stated.
Since claimant's employment history was that of a short-time worker, his adherence
to a pattern of employment previously established which would prevent the
accumulation of more than the one effective day per week did not, in and of
itself, render him unavailable for employment. The intention of the legislature
to provide for the payment of benefits to persons so situated is evident from
the section of the Law cited above. The initial determination of unavailability
effective July 2, 1956 was therefore incorrectly issued. Claimant was
unavailable as a short-time worker from July 2 through August 5, 1956. However,
the record amply supports the referee's decision as to the initial
determination of unavailability effective August 6, 1956, which is based upon
claimant's lack of diligence in seeking employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worked for an upholstery supply firm from December 1949 to January 9, 1953,
when he lost his employment by reason of a lack of work. Claimant filed a claim
for benefits effective January 12, 1953 and registered for employment. After
losing his employment, claimant arranged to form a partnership with a friend
for the purpose of manufacturing foam rubber cushions. On or about February 12,
1953, claimant and this person filed in the County Clerk’s office a certificate
of partnership. On February 10 they started to search for premises suitable for
the conduct of the business and conferred with an attorney to prepare a partnership
agreement. On February 17 they entered into a lease for business premises
commencing March 1, 1953. However, they were given possession of the premises
on February 17 so that they could put them in condition for operating the
business. In the interim, claimant and his partner arranged for the purchase of
a machine and cutting table. Claimant arranged for opening a partnership bank
account to which he and his partner contributed $2,000 each. Claimant also
arranged for electricity and telephone service and purchased foam rubber, the
delivery of which he accepted at the business premises. He also mailed
circulars announcing the opening of the business. The actual business of the
partnership was not commenced until March 2. Claimant’s partner remained at his
job until February 28. Claimant had no knowledge of the production phase of the
business, but was to act as a salesman. His partner, who was acquainted with
production methods, would instruct claimant with regard thereto. During the
period in issue, claimant’s search for employment was limited to the
examination of newspaper advertisements. He did not call on prospective
employers. Claimant did not disclose to the local office his contemplated
partnership venture, nor was any inquiry made with respect thereto. Based on a
statement by claimant and an investigation conducted by the Division of
Employment, the local office issued initial determinations (1) holding claimant
ineligible to receive benefits effective February 10, 1953 on the ground that he
was unavailable for employment or, in the alternative, holding him ineligible
to receive benefits on the ground that he was not totally unemployed and
charging him with an overpayment of $90 in benefits and (2) holding that
claimant wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits
and imposing a forfeiture of 24 effective days as a penalty therefor. Claimant
protested the determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determinations and the Industrial Commissioner has appealed to this
Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee concluded
that claimant rendered no substantial services to the partnership before March
2 and that he made continued efforts to secure work thereby demonstrating his
availability for employment. We do not agree with these conclusions. The record
discloses that the services which claimant performed for the partnership were
quite substantial in nature. Claimant arranged for electricity and telephone
service, looked for and arranged for the purchase of raw material and the
machinery necessary to commence manufacturing operations, arranged for the
opening of a partnership bank account, personally filed a certificate of
partnership in the County Clerk’s office and mailed circulars. All of this
consumed considerable time and claimant could not therefore be said to have
been available for employment from and after February 10 when the search for
suitable business premises was begun. We are not persuaded by his testimony to
the effect that he engaged in these activities on Saturdays only. We do not
believe that claimant was available for employment. His testimony before the
referee, that he was willing to accept employment during the interim and that
he examined the newspaper advertisements but found nothing suitable, is not
convincing. The commencement of partnership operations was imminent. The
preparatory details required of claimant not only his time but also his
presence in and about the store. He had invested a substantial sum of money.
Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that claimant was genuinely attached
to the labor market from and after February 10, 1953 (See Appeal Board,
39,432-53). The referee's decision on the issue of wilful misrepresentation was
correct. Claimant made no affirmative statement with regard to his partnership
venture, which was to commence in the future. The mere failure to disclose this
information, standing by itself, is not the equivalent of wilfully making a
false statement, which alone justifies the imposition of the penalty prescribed
by statute. (See Appeal Board, 33,081-52). The initial determinations of the
local office, holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective
February 10, 1953 on the ground that he was unavailable for employment and
charging him with an overpayment of $90 in benefits as a result thereof, are
sustained. The initial determination of the local office, holding that claimant
wilfully made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining benefits and
imposing a forfeiture of 24 effective days as a penalty therefor, is overruled.
The decision of the referee is modified accordingly and, as so modified, is
affirmed. (November 27, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This is an appeal by
the Industrial Commissioner from that part of a decision of the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board which overruled an initial determination of the
Commissioner holding that claimant made wilful false statements or
representations to obtain unemployment insurance benefits, and which imposed a
forfeiture for 24 effective days pursuant to Section 594 of the statute.
Claimant filed an original claim for benefits effective January 12, 1953. The
Industrial Commissioner made a determination that claimant was unavailable for
employment commencing February 10, 1953, or, in the alternative, that he was
not totally unemployed commencing on that date. As a result of this finding an
overpayment charge was made against claimant in the sum of $90.00. The
Commissioner also determined that claimant made false statements or
representations to obtain benefits on February 17<sup>th</sup>, February 24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and
March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1953, and a forfeiture of benefits for 24 effective days
was imposed. The finding of false representations was made upon the premise
that claimant failed to disclose the following facts. After his last employment
on January 9<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>1953 he entered into a partnership agreement with
another individual. They began looking for a place in which to conduct their
business about February 10, 1953. A certificate for conducting business under
an assumed name was filed by them on February 12<sup>th</sup>, and five days
later they executed a lease of certain premises for a period of one year. A
written partnership agreement between them was executed on February 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and
each of the partners contributed the sum of $2,000 to be proposed business.
None of these facts were disclosed to the Unemployment Insurance authorities.
After a hearing before a referee the initial determinations of the Industrial
Commissioner were reversed. The Board in turn reversed that portion of the
referee’s decision which held that claimant was totally unemployed and
available for employment commencing February 10, 1953, and was not overpaid
$90.00 in benefits, but sustained that portion which held that claimant did not
make wilful false statements or representations in order to obtain benefits. In
that connection the Board said: &quot;Claimant made no affirmative statement
with regard to his partnership venture, which was to commence in the future.
The mere failure to disclose this information, standing by itself, is not the
equivalent of wilfully making a false statement which alone justifies the
imposition of the penalty prescribed by statute&quot;. The Commissioner argues
that by this decision the Board has held as a matter of law that a failure to
disclose material information cannot form the basis for a determination that
claimant made a false statement or representation to obtain benefits. We do not
construe the decision of the Board so broadly. It was necessarily limited to the
facts of this claim, and thus was a factual determination and not the statement
of any principle of law. Of course, a fraudulent representation may be implied
by silence when there is a duty to speak, but whether silence amounts to a
wilful misrepresentation is dependent upon the facts of the situation and the
intent of the party who fails to speak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner and of the
employer appeared and testified. The cases were consolidated because of the
similarity of the issues. Claimants, foundry workers, filed claims on or about
July 2, 1956. By initial determinations effective July 4, claimants' benefits
were suspended for seven weeks because they lost their employment through an
industrial controversy in connection with their employment. The company was in
contractual relations with a union. The contract was to expire on June 30,
1956. The company and the union were negotiating for a new contract. On June 28
the foundry division was shut down for vacations. They were to return to work
on July 23. Maintenance and warehousemen and some workers in the machine
division were to report to work on July 2. About 180 workers reported. A
similar number reported on July 3. At 9 a.m. on July 3, these workers left the
plant to take a strike vote. At 12 noon on July 3, the company was notified
that the union had approved a strike. Employees left the plant. A picket line
was established. On July 23, the employees did not return to work and the
picket line continued. Workers received vacation payment in accordance with the
contract between the company and the union. Some workers received three weeks'
vacation pay. The closing of the plant, for vacation purposes, was at the
option of the company. Workers did not need to go to the plant on July 23, as
the local radio stations and newspapers announced that the strike was still
continuing. Workers contended that they were unemployed during the three-week
plant shutdown because of a lack of work and not because of an industrial
controversy. According to the employer, the company had arranged with the union
to use the three-week period to install machinery. The installers were not
permitted to pass the picket lines. The workers in the foundry division will
not be recalled for three weeks after the strike terminates, because the
machines must be installed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is not within the province of the administrators of unemployment insurance
to inquire into or determine the merits of any industrial controversy, it seems
clear that Section 592.1 is not penal in nature, but is designed to provide
what the Legislature deemed a reasonable period during which the State stand
aside pending the adjustment of the differences between employer and employees.
Accordingly, our interpretation thereof must not be a deterrent to the prompt

our view the Legislature intended that all claimants involved in a strike or
other industrial controversy should be treated alike during a single fixed
period measured from the day following the strike or industrial controversy.
The error in departing from this principle is, we think, illustrated in the
referee's distinction between those on sick leave when the strike commenced and
those who took sick immediately thereafter. Although both categories obviously
merit the same treatment, opposite results were arrived at on an artificial
basis. If the strike suspension period in the law were penal in nature, there
would be justification of segregating claimants on the basis of their
employment, availability and capability. The provisions in question are not
penal but rather designed to maintain the State's policy on neutrality in an
industrial controversy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Appeal Board 21,135-49, and held that where workers who clearly were
unemployed because of a strike, receive vacation payments during the suspension
period, that such payments were not effective to extend the suspension period.
Clearly all claimants, irrespective of vacation payments, were unemployed because
of an industrial controversy, effective July 4. The initial determinations as
to all claimants are sustained. (August 9, 1956)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

although they received vacation pay covering a period following the date on

the &quot;paid&quot; status terminates. Thus, in A.B. 20,702-49 (not reported
in the Interpretation Service), the employer's establishment was closed on
April 2 because of a strike, and claimant continued on the employer's payroll
until May 20 in a standby capacity. The Board ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

find that claimant was employed until May 20, 1949. Although claimant was
excused from the performance of any services, nevertheless he was subject to
call at the employer's pleasure throughout the period for which he received
remuneration. The employer had the right to require the rendition of services
throughout that period. Claimant therefore lost his employment as of May 20,
1949 and the local office properly suspended his benefit rights as of May 21,

at which time he requested that he be given credit for the period from March 27
through April 3, 1951. At the interview, he advanced as a reason for his
failure to appear at the local office on March 27, 1951, that his mother died
and that according to his religious scruples, he was in mourning for a period
of seven days thereafter which included March 27, 1951. When pressed for proof,

death of his mother was a pure fabrication. Claimant then stated that the

he was ill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

statements but prior to the conclusion of the interview made retractions. The
Board held that since claimants had retracted prior to the conclusion of the

material difference between the cited cases and the case at hand, other than
the claimant left the insurance office and returned on the same day and
retracted her former statement. The Commissioner's position that claimant's

benefits effective November 19, 1956. Claimant was employed in an office where
she assisted three doctors who occupied the same office and had office hours at
different periods. Claimant obtained this position through an employment agency
and she was required to pay the agency a fee of $60 in three installments of
$20 each, in the event she worked on the job more than two weeks. Claimant's
duties were to answer the telephone, make appointments, assist in the handling
of patients by ushering them into treatment rooms, keeping records of treatment
and handling cash. Claimant decided to leave the job because she would have to
pay the fee of $60 for the job if she stayed more than two weeks and she felt
that if she was paying for a job she should get one that she liked better. The
Industrial Commissioner appeals from the decision of the referee overruling the
initial determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are not in accord with the referee's decision. The evidence indicates that the
only reason claimant left the employment was because she did not want to pay a
fee for a job which she did not like. Consequently she quit before her
obligation to the employment agency became fixed. Claimant did not have good
cause to leave her employment within the Unemployment Insurance Law. The
initial determination should be sustained. The initial determination of the
local office disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive
days effective November 19, 1956, on the ground that she voluntarily left her

counterman, filed for benefits effective December 24, 1956 and refiled
effective January 21, 1957. By an initial determination effective December 24,
claimant was disqualified for 42 consecutive days for voluntarily leaving
employment without good cause. This disqualification was deemed terminated when
claimant obtained employment commencing with January 9.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant learned of a
job opening as a counterman. He applied for this job and learned that the
employers required the job applicant to make an investment in the business.
Claimant is 25 years of age and single. He told the prospective employers, to
whom he was not related, that he had some funds. He thereupon became employed
in July, 1956, under an arrangement whereby he purchased one-third interest in
the corporation which operated the luncheonette. Three shares of stock were
issued to him and he was made the secretary. It was agreed that all three
principals would work and that each would be paid $60 per week. Claimant
continued to work under the above arrangement until December 21.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Beginning with November,
the luncheonette began to experience business losses. By December, the principals
realized that the debts so far exceeded the working capital that the firm would
have to go into bankruptcy by the end of 1956. The principals decided that
since claimant was the last one to join the corporation, he would have to be
the one to leave and it would thereby be spared the necessity of paying him his
weekly salary. Unless this was done, the entire enterprise would collapse.
Claimant was given $1,000 in cash and a series of notes in the amount of $100
each, payable monthly, for a total of $3,000. Claimant had no other definite
job prospect when he left the business under the above arrangement. He believed
that he would soon be able to secure other work from the Delicatessen and
Restaurant Counterman's Union, of which he is a member, and he did secure work
through the union beginning with January 9, 1957.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant asserts that
he did not voluntarily leave his employment on December 21, but that he was
forced out of his job and that he had no choice in the matter because he was a
minority stockholder compelled to accede to the decision which was made by the
majority stockholders and he lost not only his job, but at least $1,000 with
the possibility that he may in time salvage very little of the $3,000 worth of
promissory notes when he sold his tock back to the corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

For all practical purposes, claimant's investment consisted of buying a job.

business would have collapsed and he would still have become unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from the one relied upon and, for that reason, it is inapplicable. The initial

overruled. (March 5, 1957)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

noted however, that in both these illustrations the officer had good cause for

effect that the vigilance of local office personnel and claimant's admission
that she had altered the date in her reporting booklet prevented her from
wilfully making a false statement to obtain benefits. This was based on the
premise that a misrepresentation could not occur until claimant reported to the
insurance office to certify for benefits for the week ending April 28, 1957. We

the purpose of obtaining benefits only in connection with the certification
process at the local insurance office. This is erroneous. Registration at and
reporting to both the insurance office and the employment service office, as
well as certification to eligibility for benefits are essential steps in the
administrative process for the payment of benefits. A false statement may be
made at any stage of the proceedings from the time a claim is first filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

altered the reporting date in her identification booklet. She offered no
satisfactory reason for doing so. She appeared at the employment office and
presented her booklet, thereby representing that she was reporting in
conformity with instructions. The fact that claimant admitted her guilt as soon
as the alteration was discovered does not serve to excuse her. She did not take
the initiative in volunteering the information and presumably would not have
made the disclosure had the alteration not been observed by employment office
personnel. Claimant was seeking to avoid an initial determination of
ineligibility by reason of her failure to report on the date actually assigned
to her, which determination would not have been issued had claimant's
alteration of her booklet not been discovered. She wilfully made a false
representation for the purpose of obtaining benefits by presenting her booklet
in its altered condition, knowing that it would be used as the basis for
determining her eligibility at least insofar as compliance with reporting

City as a receiving clerk in a retail dry cleaning establishment to move to
Florida with her parents. She arrived there on April 10, 1957 and on April 15,
and April 22 she reported to the state employment office in St. Petersburg. On
April 22 claimant refused an offer of employment as a countergirl in a dry
cleaning store at a salary of $35 for a 48-hour week. The referee found that
the usual remuneration for such work in the area is $30 to $35 for a 48-hour
week. After this refusal of employment and later in the day on April 22
claimant went to the insurance office in St. Petersburg and filed a claim for
benefits against New York as the liable state. The claim was made effective
April 22, 1957. The Out-of-State Resident Office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits effective April
22, 1957 on the ground that without good cause she refused employment for which
she is reasonably fitted by training and experience. Claimant protested on the
ground that she was not a claimant for benefits at the time of her refusal and
requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination and the

identical situation and reached an opposite result. There the claimant had
refused employment on the morning of October 11, 1955 and later that same day

employed as a foreman by a construction firm since about January, 1954. He was
laid off on December 22, 1956, because of lack of work. In accordance with company
policy, the employer agreed to pay claimant $50 per week (which represents
about 25 percent of his weekly earnings) during any periods from December 24,
1956, to March 16, 1957, while claimant was in a layoff status, as stand-by pay
in consideration of claimant’s promise to return to his job when recalled.
Claimant was not required to report or shape up during a layoff. The employer’s
agreement was not tied in with a union contract. Claimant was permitted to seek
and accept any interim employment while in a layoff status during the term of
the aforesaid agreement, without prejudice to his weekly stand-by payments. No
evidence was submitted that claimant was ineligible for assignment by his union
to other employment during his layoff while receiving stand-by payments. In
fact, claimant’s interstate claim forms indicate that he registered for work
with his union and maintained daily contacts therewith. The employer’s
motivation for making this agreement was to encourage claimant to return to his
job when his services were needed. The employer does not consider the stand-by
payment as remuneration for worked performed or services rendered by claimant
in employment. The Board makes the following additional findings of fact: The
referee overruled the initial determination and the Industrial Commissioner
appealed to the Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commissioner contends on this appeal that the referee’s decision is directly

the stand-by payments made to claimant constituted remuneration for employment
and rendered him totally unemployed. Our decision in Appeal Board 31,003-52 and
44,916-54, relied on by the Commissioner are distinguishable from the instant case.
The claimant in the first mentioned case was on half pay during a slack season
and we overruled the referee’s ruling that these moneys were in the nature of a
bonus for past services and did not constitute remuneration for employment. The
instant claimant received a flat sum of $50 per week as stand-by pay, he was
permitted to seek and accept other employment and in fact registered for work
with his union. Appeal Board 44,916-54 is likewise distinguishable in that we
there held that claimant was in effect on a paid leave of absence for which she
claimed benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Board 57,331-56; 58,053-56 and 58,936-57 in his holding that the stand-by
payments in this case were not remuneration for employment. Appeal Board
57,331-56 involved a payment of $4.30 to a claimant who reported for work in
accordance with instructions of the employer but who did not work because the
latter had no work for her on that day. Such payment was made pursuant to a
union contract. In holding that claimant was totally unemployed on that day, we

on that day. Appeal Board 58,053-56 involved the payment to claimant of $2.85
pursuant to a union contract providing for the payment of &quot;stand-by

employed as a truck driver, operating engineer and carpenter, respectively, on
a construction job at the Plattsburgh, New York, Air Force Base. All claimants
are members of the unions having jurisdiction over their occupations at the air
base. A general contractor and a number of subcontractors of the general
contractor were engaged in the construction work at the base and they employed,
in addition to workers in claimants’ categories, laborers, plumbers,
electricians, iron workers, masons, cement finishers and the like. The plumbing
and heating work was subcontracted to F.R. Company, which hired union plumbers,
steamfitters and operating engineers to maintain all temporary heat necessary
during the construction of the base. Claimants and other members of the various
trades working in connection with this project were employed by the respective
contractors doing work, all of which were in contractual relations with the
various unions having jurisdictions. They were not employed by the Air Force.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

funds, the Air Force decided to terminate the prime contract for heat
maintenance with the general contractor and to place civil service employees on
the base to maintain temporary heat. This was done as of December 15, 1955 and,
in turn, the subcontract between the general contractors and the heating
contractor was terminated. At a union meeting it was decided that none of the
plumbers or steamfitters would work on the base unless the temporary heat was
supplied by union members. Pickets were placed at the various entrances at the
base on the morning of December 16, 1955 who carried signs reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for work to his general foreman who told him there was not work for him on that
day. He returned on Monday, December 19 and was told that there would be no
further work for him until the first of the year. He thereupon turned in the
keys to his truck. Claimant B reported to the job site on the morning of
December 16 but did not report to work because of the picket line. Claimant C
had previously received a layoff notice effective after the close of work on
December 16, he came to the base on the morning of December 16 but did not
report to work because he saw the pickets and he would not cross the picket
lines unless authorized to do so by his union. Of the hundreds of other workers
on the base, some crossed the picket line but there was no work for them on
account of the general stoppage of work and others refused to cross the picket
line because they would be subject to union discipline if they did. A complete
work stoppage at the base resulted and the Air Force then issued instructions
to its personnel not to permit civilians to enter the base unless they were

for the Air Force directly. No demands were made by any of the unions on any of
the employers operating at the base. No dispute existed between the union
members and the Air force as to terms and conditions of employment. The dispute
was settled on January 21, 1956 when a union contractor was engaged to maintain
the temporary heat with a slight reduction in the maintenance cost to the Air
Force. Many of the workers employed were not rehired after the termination of
the dispute, due largely to the inclement weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that an industrial controversy existed in this case, on the theory that the
concerted action of the various unions above described, constituted a work
stoppage for the purpose of exerting pressure through the contractors and
subcontractors on the Air Force to accede to demands made by several of the
unions. We do not agree that this concerted action constituted &quot;a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy&quot; within the meaning of the Law. No
elements of a strike or lockout existed as far as concerned the workmen and
their employers. Further, we are unable to find in this case that they were
present any of the elements of an industrial controversy, as contemplated in
Section 592.1 of the New York State Unemployment Insurance Law. No dispute
existed between the various contractors and their employees either with respect
to representation or terms and conditions of employment. No controversy had
arisen at any time out of the respective interests of these employers and their
employees. Neither the mere placing of pickets at the premises where the work
was being performed nor the concerted work stoppage which resulted for the
purpose of exerting pressure on a third party in order to compel that third
party to have certain services performed by contract with a particular type of
contractor rather than to have the work otherwise performed, does not create an
industrial controversy within the meaning of the Law. Whether or not this can
be labeled as a secondary boycott or an economic weapon of some sort or other
sort is not material to this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who became unemployed at the place where they were working because of a strike
by employees of other contractors engaged at the same place, and said
electricians refused to cross the picket line, had not lost their employment as
a result of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed. In those cases the question involved was as to what constituted the
&quot;establishment in which claimants were employed&quot;. In the instant
case, we have concluded that no industrial controversy existed at all. It
follows,&nbsp;<u>a fortiori</u>, that the principle of the court in the
Bucklaew and Wittlaufer cases should be applied to the circumstances now before

Opinion for reversal:</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The issue is
whether claimants were barred from benefits for a period of seven weeks because
they lost their employment &quot;because of a strike, lockout or other
industrial controversy&quot; (Unemployment Insurance Law, Sec. 592,subd. 1).
The work involved was at a United States air base at Plattsburgh, New York. The
federal officials, as an economy measure, terminated heating contracts with two
prime contractors and replaced the union steamfitters and stationary engineers,
who were operating a temporary heating service during the course of
construction, with civil service employees. A union meeting was held and it was
determined that no union plumbers or steamfitters would work on the project
unless the civil service employees were dismissed. Picket lines were
established across the various entrances to the base and, although the signs
carried by the pickets said &quot;All persons are free to cross the picket
line,&quot; a work stoppage resulted. Claimants were disqualified for benefits
for seven weeks by the Industrial Commissioner upon two theories: (1) that they
had left their employment without good cause; (2) that their loss of employment
was due to an industrial controversy in the establishment where they were
employed. The referee held the first ground to be invalid but sustained the
determination that claimants lost their employment because of an industrial
controversy. In so determining the referee held that the work stoppage was
caused &quot;in order to exert pressure through the contractors and
subcontractors on the Air Force to accede to demands made by several of the
allied unions&quot; and this he found to be industrial controversy. The
evidence would sustain a finding that the procedure adopted by the unions was
to exert pressure on the Air Force to reinstate the contract terminated or make
a new contract for the employment of the union labor. The Board in effect
reversed the referee, holding that no industrial controversy existed, on the
ground that the dispute was between the unions and the Air Force and not
between the unions and the contractors, who were the employers. It said &quot;Neither
the mere placing of pickets at the premises where the work was being performed
or the concerted work stoppage which resulted for the purpose of exerting
pressure on a third party in order to compel that third party to have certain
services performed by contract under a particular type of contractor rather
than have the work otherwise performed does not create an industrial
controversy within the meaning of the law.&quot; The foregoing statement of
course is not one of fact but one of law, and we disagree with the conclusion
reached by the Board. While it may be said, at least technically, that no
lockout or strike existed, certainly an industrial controversy existed. The
language of the statute in that respect is very broad and there is no
indication in its legislative history or otherwise that the legislative
intended to limit such language as narrowly as the Board in this case has
construed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

insurance company from April 22 to May 10, submitting her application for
employment to the company she gave her date of birth as May 26, 1902. Actually,
she was born June 28, 1897. The employer has established a special pension plan
under which it hires women, ages 45 to 55, so that the oldest among them may
benefit under the plan after having been employed at least ten years. The
company will not hire any women over 55 since such employee should not benefit
under the pension plan. In establishing this plan the employer desires to
invite into the labor market, again, women who have not been employed for some
time. The company designates the plan as its &quot;special mature
program,&quot; and it is designed for the benefit of such female employees.
Claimant was not required to submit proof of her age on hiring. Shortly before
she became unemployed the employer demanded proof of age. Claimant was unable
to produce such proof and her services were terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the conclusion of the referee that claimant did not lose her employment through
misconduct in connection with her employment. While we do not condone the
giving of false information, we are of the opinion that something more must be
shown in order to sustain an initial determination of misconduct. It was held
in UCFE-41-55 that the mere falsification of an application for employment is
not misconduct, per se, and that in order to sustain such a determination it
must appear that the interests of the employer have been prejudiced. The
employer’s pecuniary interest has not been prejudiced or subjected to jeopardy.
Neither actual nor potential loss to the employer has been shown. Since that is
so, the initial determination of misconduct was improperly issued. Compare
Appeal Board 39,840-53 and Appeal Board 43,944-54, in each of which cases the
record established that in addition to the false statement on claimant’s application
for employment, there was actual or possible damage to the employer’ pecuniary
interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

relying on a survey of job orders received by the employment service which

job orders, which merely reflect what particular employer may be willing to pay
rather than what is actually being paid generally, do not constitute acceptable
evidence of prevailing wages (Appeal Board 11,354-44). The Information as to
prevailing hours in the instant case, being based upon job orders is likewise
not considered persuasive proof as to prevailing conditions. The number of
hours of work per week required of claimant was not substantially less
favorable to her than the number of hours prevailing in the locality of her
type of work. At worst it was only the distribution of the total number of
hours within the working week which differed (if it did) from the schedule of
working hours prevailing for persons in claimant's occupational classification.
Claimant did not establish that she could not accept the employment at the
hours which were offered to her. She merely asserted that she would not. Under
these circumstances her refusal was arbitrary and unjustified, being based upon
personal preferences which were not compelling. An offer of employment need not
meet each and every condition which claimant may impose. (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of

within the meaning of Section 523 claimant's work with the railroad therefore
did not constitute employment. He reasoned that claimant's railroad earnings
did not prevent him from accumulating effective days in the week in question
and that a valid original claim could therefore be filed in that week since
claimant had five days of total unemployment as that term is defined in Section
522 of the Law. We believe the referee has construed the statute too narrowly.
The term &quot;employment&quot; appears many times in the Unemployment Insurance
Law. It is defined generally as &quot;any service under any contract of
employment for hire, express, or implied, written or oral.&quot; (Section
511.1) There is no indication that the provision excluding railroad work from
the term &quot;employment,&quot; as well as other similar exclusions of
services such as agricultural labor, as a golf caddy, of a spouse or minor
child or of a student, was intended to relate to the &quot;effective day&quot;
provisions of the statute. Significantly, in defining &quot;total
unemployment&quot; as the total lack of any employment, the statute further
provides that &quot;the term 'employment' as used in this section means&nbsp;<u>any
employment including that not</u>&nbsp;<u>defined in this title.</u>&quot;
(Section 522) (Underscoring supplied) It is noted also that in 1955 Section 523
of the Law was amended so that the term &quot;compensation&quot; which appears
in the sentence of said section beginning: &quot;No effective days . . .&quot;
was substituted for the term &quot;remuneration&quot; which has a narrower
meaning in the statute. We are of the opinion that claimant's compensation
which exceeded $36, even though received from railroad work which is not deemed
employment under our law for certain purposes, barred the accumulation of
effective days in the week in question and that it was correctly ruled he could
not file a valid original claim for benefits. The initial determination of the
local office is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (November
29, 1957)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a claimant who worked in railroad employment which is excluded from the
definition of &quot;employment&quot; (Sec. 511.1) for the general purposes of
the Unemployment Insurance Law. However, the principle is not confined to such
work but is applicable to all types of &quot;excluded&quot; employment. The
underlying theory is that certain employment although &quot;excluded&quot; for
other purposes is nonetheless &quot;employment&quot; in establishing whether
there is total unemployment within the meaning of Sec. 522 and for the purpose
of ascertaining &quot;effective days&quot; under Section 523 of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had been a stockholder and officer of various corporations which operated dairy
restaurants until about two and a half years ago. Claimant was at all times
employed by the corporations of which he was a stockholder. He managed the
dairy restaurants operated by such corporations. During those times claimant
was usually a 50 per cent stockholder of the corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two and a half years ago the corporation by which claimant was then employed
assigned its lease to a new corporation. The person who held the remaining 50
per cent of the stock of the assignor corporation relinquished his interest in
the corporation and claimant, together with three other persons, became
stockholders of a corporation which was organized to receive the assignment of
the lease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

became a 25 per cent stockholder of the new corporation which thenceforth
operated a delicatessen as well as a dairy restaurant. The remaining
stockholders were persons experienced in the operation of a delicatessen.
Claimant had no experience in the operation of a delicatessen. He was assigned
by the new corporation to manage its dairy department. After a brief period of
time one of the four stockholders was forced out of the corporation and his
shares of stock were divided among the three remaining stockholders so that
claimant became an owner of 33 1/3 per cent interest in the corporation. In the
two and a half years period which followed the organization of that
corporation, its dairy business gradually diminished and its delicatessen
business flourished. By reason of that fact, and because claimant was qualified
solely to handle the dairy business, the owners of the remaining 66 2/3 per
cent of the stock of that corporation insisted that claimant withdraw from the
corporation and sell to them his shares of stock in the corporation. They
threatened to bring about the dissolution of the corporation in the event
claimant refused to withdraw therefrom and sell his stock to them. Claimant
knew that if he were to sell his stock he would be able to realize a profit
thereon but that if he refused to sell his stock and the threat of his fellow stockholders
were carried out, he would suffer a substantial loss, since the value of his
stock on a forced sale would be substantially less than the price he could
receive therefor by a voluntary sale. Accordingly, to avoid a dissolution of
the corporation, claimant yielded to the requests of his fellow stockholders
and he sold to them his shares of stock in the corporation and, thereupon, his
employment by the corporation was terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contended on behalf of the Industrial Commissioner that claimant voluntarily
left his employment without good cause because he &quot;voluntarily&quot; sold
his stock in the corporation, which precipitated the termination of his
employment. The facts herein indicate that there was a compelling reason for
the sale of claimant's stock. The threats of the majority stockholders brought
about a situation which endangered claimant's capital investment in the
corporation. If he remained adamant and the threats of the majority
stockholders were carried out, there was likelihood that his stock would become
almost worthless. Under these circumstances, he had no alternative but to yield
to the requests of the majority stockholders and to sell his stock to them. The
termination of his employment which resulted was not a voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is contended by the
Industrial Commissioner that our decisions in Appeal Board 60,666-57;
57,735-56; 54,153-56 and 53,399-55 require a reversal of the referee's decision
on the issue of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. In our
view, these cases are distinguishable because the claimants therein became
voluntarily unemployed through voluntary sale of their stock for non-compelling
personal reasons which did not constitute good cause within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. For example, in Appeal Board 60,666-57 the
claimant, a 50 per cent stockholder and corporate officer, sold his stock
because of a decline in corporate earnings and disagreements with his associate
(the other 50 per cent stockholder and officer). His resulting unemployment was
by his own choice; it was not dictated by compelling necessity. Similarly, the
claimant in appeal Board 57,735-56 became voluntarily unemployed by the sale of
his 50 per cent stock in a corporation to the other 50 per cent stockholder
because of friction between them, and also because he did not desire to
continue to invest in the business. We stated that &quot;claimant became
unemployed as a result of the sale by him of his interest in the corporate
employer to the other stockholder of the corporation primarily because of the
differences between them. His reason for leaving the employment was personal
rather than of a compelling nature, and . . . did not constitute good cause . .
.&quot; Similar factual situations existed in Appeal Board 54,153-56 and
53,399-55. The factual situation presented there is different from that in the
case cited. We have found that claimant had compelling reasons to sell his
stock although he did not wish to terminate his employment. The employer
corporation reported to the insurance office tat claimant &quot;did not sell
his shares of stock voluntarily. He was a minority stockholder and was
compelled by the remaining two stockholders to sell his interest in the
corporation due to the fact that the corporation did not want to continue his
employment . . . and his services were not required.&quot; The employer further
reported that claimant became unemployed because of &quot;lack of work -
indefinite (permanent lay-off).&quot; We regard as applicable the decision in
Case #520-416-57R (affirmed in Appeal Board 61,437-57) where the referee stated
in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>. . .
They transferred their stock to buyers who could no longer use their services.
This was a salvage measure made necessary by the circumstances recited. It
cannot be said that such circumstances were &quot;personal&quot; rather than
&quot;compelling.&quot; The facts in this case appear to be in line with those
found in Case 51-42-57R, in which a referee held that a claimant who sold his
stock interest because of compelling circumstances did not voluntarily leave
employment. There is no appeal taken from that decision. There, the referee
pointed out that the claimant allegedly &quot;was forced out of his job and
that he had no choice in the matter because he was a minority stockholder
compelled to accede to the decision which was made by the majority
stockholders.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

assiduously searched for work in his occupation and was genuinely in the labor
market throughout the period in issue. We conclude that claimant left his

office is overruled. The decision of the referee is affirmed. (December 6,

Claimant was regularly employed as a woodworker on commercial automobile bodies

Claimant relieved her on occasion so that she could enjoy some time away from the

averaged approximately $350 a week. The business was operated on a basis
varying between $600 monthly loss and a $360 profit. The referee overruled the

this case more closely resemble those in Appeal Board, 52,380-55, cited in the
referee's decision. It is obvious that it was not claimant's mere proprietary
interest in a business venture which rendered him not totally unemployed in
the&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>&nbsp;case (supra), but rather the fact that he devoted a
substantial portion of the working day to the furtherance of such enterprise
while a claimant for unemployment insurance benefits. That factor does not
appear in the instant case inasmuch as it has been clearly shown that such time
as claimant spent in the furtherance of his business enterprise was during
hours other than those when he would normally have been employed. It appears
that such activities in connection with the business in which the claimant
engaged were not substantial and were merely for the purpose of protecting his
investment (Appeal Board, 52,169-55). Such activities appear to have been no
greater in extent that when claimant was employed full time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worked for four months with her last employer on a full-time basis until March
7, 1957. Her work history for many years was on a full-time basis. Because of
an injury to her leg which she sustained in the shop, she was unable to do any
work at all until May 9, 1957. Then claimant's doctor advised her that she
could return to work provided she worked less than full-time for about two
weeks. Claimant offered to return to her job on a part-time basis but was told
that the employer was &quot;short of work.&quot; Claimant looked for work in
many other places but was unable to find a job. Claimant's physical condition

interview with claimant and a report from her doctor from which it appeared
that between May 13 and May 26, 1957 claimant, who had formerly worked
full-time, was able to work only part-time, the local office issued an initial
determination holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective May 13
through May 26, 1957 on the ground that she was unavailable for employment.
Claimant protested the initial determination and requested a hearing. The
referee overruled the initial determination and the Industrial Commissioner
appealed to the Board. The Board affirmed the decision of the referee (A.B.
61,268-57). Thereafter the Board on it own motion, determined to reopen and

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The problem as to the availability for work of
claimants who are compelled to seek part-time work, although formerly employed
full-time, is not a new one. In Appeal Board 8271-42 the Board recognized that
a restriction to part-time work because of compelling circumstances should not
automatically result in a finding of unavailability for employment and
accordingly ruled claimant ineligible to receive benefits. The Industrial
Commissioner argues that such a restriction automatically rendered claimant
herein unavailable for employment. Appeal Board 51,432-55 and 55,193-56 are
cited in support of such contention. Both of those cases involved claimants
who, for reasons personal, but not compelling, limited themselves to part-time
work, although they previously worked full-time. These restrictions were
imposed in order that not to jeopardize their eligibility to receive social
security benefits. The cited cases are obviously not in point here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Industrial
Commissioner further argues that the decision of the referee affirmed by the
Board, is incorrect as a matter of law. The same or similar arguments were
advanced and rejected by the Board in Appeal Board, 60,802-57, involving
similar facts. We quote pertinent portions of the opinion in that case,
reflecting principles which we deem applicable here:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The subject of
eligibility for benefits (including the requirement of availability for
employment), is contained in Section 591 of the law, which, we think
significantly, bears the title &quot;Eligibility for Benefits,&quot; and
insofar as pertinent, reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Availability
and capability. No benefits shall be payable to any claimant who is not capable
of work or&nbsp;<u>who is not ready, willing and able</u>&nbsp;to work in his
usual employment or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training
and experience. (As amended by Laws of 1953, Chapter 720, effective May 4,
1953) (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is not contended that
claimant was incapable of employment. Only her availability therefor is at
issue. Did claimant meet the availability requirement as above set forth? We
believe the answer must be in the affirmative. Claimant was &quot;ready,
willing and able&quot; to work in her usual employment and indeed, succeeded in
finding such work. What then can be considered a bar to her availability? It is
argued upon us that claimant cannot be considered available on the premise that
although she worked full-time formerly she is now compelled to work part-time.
This is not logical. Section 591 of the Law, which deals with eligibility for
benefits, does not distinguish between full-time and part-time employment, and
we believe that it is by the terms of that section of the Law that claimant's
right to receive benefits is to be judged, rather than by the arbitrary
assumption that there is an inherent difference between the two schedules of
working hours, insofar as eligibility for benefits concerned. (Compare&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Lehrman</u>, 281 App. Div. 936, affirming A.B. 30,832-52, where it was held
that the Unemployment Insurance Law makes no distinction between temporary and
permanent employment)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the referee, claimant indicated that she was aware that she was required to
report to the local office on November 20 but did not do so until December 3.
She also indicated that she did not dispute the said initial determination. On
that basis, the referee ruled that the initial determination remained in
effect. In addition thereto, he overruled another initial determination which
was issued by the local office holding that claimant was ineligible to receive
benefits effective November 11, 1957 on the ground that she was unavailable for
employment. Claimant appealed from that part of the referee's decision which
ruled that the initial determination holding that she was ineligible to receive
benefits effective November 20, 1957 through December 1, 1957 remained in
effect because she did not dispute such initial determination. Her excuse now
is that she was unable to report at the local office on November 20, 1957, as
instructed, because she did not have the necessary carfare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer-employee relationship ceased absolutely after the initial rendition of

the part of the employer to pay the claimant an additional sum for the services
originally rendered. Such payment was to become due on some indeterminate date
in the future and upon the occurrence of a specified event; namely, the re-use
of the product of claimant’s work (compare Appeal Board 14,542-47). At the time
the additional payments were made to the claimant herein she no longer was
under the supervision, direction or control of the employer. Her work was
completed then. The employment relationship between the parties to the contract
had terminated upon the completion of the actual filming or recording of the
television or radio commercial, as the case may be. The re-use payments which
claimant received were not &quot;for&quot; a day or a week of
&quot;employment,&quot; as defined by Sections 511 and 524 of the Law, but in
satisfaction of a previous contractual obligation on the part of the employer

&quot;remuneration&quot; for services performed under a contract of hire which
gives rise to &quot;employment.&quot; The issue, therefore, is whether this
claimant was paid re-use fees for certain days of &quot;employment.&quot; The
payments which she received after her actual work had ceased was manifestly
part of the original contract of employment for services actually performed in
connection with the filming and recording of the radio and television
commercials and was in addition to the regular fees originally received for
such work. The payments were not made for days of &quot;employment&quot; during
the additional weeks in issue herein. On the contrary, the right to such
payments was measured by previous services already rendered all of which
occurred prior to the periods in issue and they were &quot;in the nature of
contractual payments due for past services.&quot; It follows, therefore, that
since claimant was totally unemployed within the meaning of the Law during the
various periods in issue, she should not be credited with weeks of employment
merely because she received additional monies based upon and resulting from
antecedent services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Kaftan</u>, et al, 283 App. Div. 759, reversing Appeal Board 34,619-52). In
those cases, the respective claimants were held ineligible to receive
unemployment insurance benefits on the ground that they were not totally
unemployed even though they did not actually perform any physical work. Upon
reconsideration, we arrive at a conclusion contrary to that previously made.
The facts and the contracts construed herein are different from those in the
cases above cited. The claimant therein was not required to hold herself in
readiness to render or perform services at the employer’s beck and call, during
the entire contract period as was the situation in Matter of&nbsp;<u>Bell</u>,

conclusions drawn from the facts and contracts construed herein, we observe
that it would be impossible to administer the payment of benefits based upon

multiple determinations of disqualifications and forfeitures affecting the

that claimant did not have any &quot;employment&quot; during the respective
periods in issue. She performed no work for the employer nor did she render any
services whatsoever during said periods. She received a sum of money in payment
for a pre-existing contractual obligation assumed by the employer based upon
its adherence to the 1953 Producer-Screen Actors Guild Contract For Filmed
Commercials. This did not constitute &quot;compensation&quot; allocable to the
periods either when the commercials were re-used or when payment for such
re-use was made to claimant. Consequently, claimant must be deemed totally
unemployed during the respective periods under consideration and not entitled
to be credited with weeks of employment therein (Appeal Board 56,400-56 and
57,641-56). Identical reasoning may be applied to claimant’s agreement to make
a transcription for use and re-use on radio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

received fees for the re-use or re-run of certain filmed television and
transcribed radio commercials. She was paid a fixed amount at the time the
commercials were made and the re-use fees were received pursuant to her
employment contract and the general collective bargaining agreement governing
such work. The re-use fees were based on the market to which the commercial was
presented. In order to have the requisite 20 weeks of covered employment making
her eligible for benefits it was necessary to count the weeks in which such
re-use fees were received. The referee held that since no services were
performed in those weeks that they did not constitute weeks of employment and
declared the claimant ineligible for benefits. The Board first reversed and

claimant had performed no work in the weeks in which she received re-use fees.
The Board found that the employee-employer relationship terminated once the
commercials were made. There was no direction, supervision or control over the
claimant at the time the commercials were re-used. The only restriction on her
was that under her contract she would not appear for a competitive product
during this period. This however left her free for employment by anyone else
and this restriction can not be the basis for holding that the claimant was
doing &quot;some work&quot; when these payments were received. These fees were
in realty earned with the commercial was made and their amount depended only on
the use of the commercials thereafter and no on any work or service to be

we reiterated this principle, stating that &quot;Saturday and Sunday are days

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a truck driver, filed
effective December 30, 1957. By initial determination effective December 28
through March 3, 1958, claimant's benefits were suspended because of loss of
employment due to an industrial controversy in the establishment in which he
was employed. The Commissioner's representative amended the initial
determination to be effective from December 28, 1957 through February 3, 1958.
Claimant was ruled overpaid $144 which was ruled to be recoverable. The
employer is in the trucking business. It hauled freight between terminals. It
had terminals in Albany, Poughkeepsie and other places. Claimant was a
&quot;city driver.&quot; It was his job to haul freight between points in the
immediate vicinity of Albany and the Albany terminal. This freight was carried
to or received from the other terminals in the employer's system. On December
23, 1957, a strike was called against the employer's Poughkeepsie terminal and
some other terminals. The local union in the Albany terminal was not on strike.
No workers in that terminal were on strike. No pickets were placed around the
Albany terminal. The Albany terminal continued to operate from December 23
through December 27. During this time it handled only business to and from
non-struck terminals. The employer's president decided that the employer could
not make any money this way and shut down the entire operation. Subsequently, a
general manager was engaged to resume some operations, but the strike continued
in the terminals where it started. Claimant was recalled to work on April 4,
1958.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This case is similar
to Appeal Board 48,001-54. In that case the employer was an interstate trucking
firm. A work stoppage occurred at a terminal in Birmingham, Alabama. Because no
shipments were received for local delivery, the New York City terminal was shut
down. However, none of the employees in the New York City terminals were on
strike. Their local union was not on strike and there was no picketing at such
terminal. The Appeal Board held that the employer's New York City terminal was
a separate establishment from the point of view of employment and that there
was no industrial controversy at such establishment. It follows that the Albany
terminal is an establishment separate from the Poughkeepsie terminal. While
claimant's loss of employment was due to the industrial controversy at the
Poughkeepsie terminal, there was no industrial controversy at the Albany
terminal where claimant was employed. Claimant's unemployment was not due to an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which he was employed. The
initial determination is overruled. Claimant was not overpaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and the Industrial
Commissioner of Labor appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a translator,
filed effective January 20, 1958. By initial determination effective January
20, she was disqualified for 42 days following certification of her return to
the labor market for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause and
withdrawal from the labor market. Her benefits were further forfeited for 20
effective days because of a wilful false statement to obtain benefits made on
January 27. From July 14, 1947 to June 28, 1957, claimant worked for a
reinsurance firm. On January 1, 1955, she received a salary increase from $44
to $45 per week. Several requests for further increases thereafter were
refused, and early in 1957 she advised the employer that if she did not receive
another increase, she would leave. He request was denied, and she informed the
employer that she would leave at the end of June, when she would be 65 years of
age and eligible for Federal old age benefits. The prevailing rate of pay for
such work is $4,742 per year. Prior to this employment claimant had worked for
three years for a Federal agency, and from 1934 to 1942 had worked in a bank in
Canada as a translator of banking and legal documents. After leaving her job
claimant looked for part-time or full-time work as a translator or clerk by
applying to at least six employment agencies specializing in jobs for
translators and office employees. She also examined and answered want ads for
clerks and typist, but was not hired because they want younger people. When
claimant filed her claim for benefits, she was assigned January 28 to report to
the employment office, and an entry to such effect was made in her
identification booklet. The entry was not clear to her and she was uncertain whether
the date was January 28 or January 29. On January 26, she was suffering from a
cold and felt that she would be in a better position to report on January 29.
She accordingly went over the date to report and make it clearly January 29. On
January 27 she reported to the insurance office and signed a summary of
insurance interview reciting that she had made such change for that reason. She
was again instructed to report to the employment office on January 28, and did
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant had god
cause to quit her job with the reinsurance firm since she had received no
salary increase for more than two years, her request for such an increase was
denied and the remuneration being paid to her was substantially less favorable
than that generally prevailing for similar work. Her efforts to secure work
thereafter demonstrated that she did not withdraw from the labor market.
Although claimant should not have made any alteration in her identification
booklet with respect to the date to report to the employment office, she
committed no misrepresentation to obtain benefits. The mere change of date in
claimant's booklet does not in and of itself constitute making of a false
statement to obtain benefits. It is only when such alteration is represented to
the representative of the Industrial Commissioner, and he is requested to rely
upon the validity thereof of the purpose of obtaining benefits, that a claimant
completes the making of a wilful, false statement, upon which the law imposes a
penalty. (Appeal Board 60,126-57). When claimant reported to the insurance
office on January 27, it was for the purpose of certifying for the week ending
January 27, and whether she was due to report to the employment office on
January 28 or January 29, was completely immaterial with respect to her
certifying for benefits for the week ending January 26 and, accordingly, she
made no attempt to obtain benefits on the basis of the changed entry in her
booklet. The initial determination is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

record including testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due
deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee's

this case, and that no errors of fact or law appear to have been made, the
Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the
referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Board, except as
follows: A notation was made in claimant's booklet that she was to report at
the employment office on January 28, 1958. On January 26, she altered the entry
in the booklet to make it appear that she was required to report at the
employment office on January 29 instead of January 28. Claimant gave
conflicting explanations for the unauthorized alteration. Allegedly she was
uncertain whether or not the original entry in her booklet was January 28. She
altered the date because she preferred to report at the employment office the
next day. She had a cold and believed one day's delay in reporting would not
matter. The Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of
fact and correctly determined the issues involved in this case, except as
herein modified. We are not convinced by claimant's explanation for her
alteration of the reporting date in her booklet. She was at the local office on
January 27, at which time she could have verified that January 28 was her date
to report at the employment office and requested permission to report one day
later. She did not disclose to the local office that she had altered the
reporting date in her booklet until she was questioned about it. We find that
she intended to mislead the employment office into believing that January 29
was the correct date to report thereat. Under all the circumstances, we hold
that claimant made a wilful misrepresentation to obtain benefits within the
meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. (Compare Appeal Board 64,118-58 and
59,286-57). The initial determination of the local office holding that claimant
wilfully made a false statement to obtain benefits for which her future benefit
rights were forfeited for 20 effective days is sustained. The decision of the
referee, insofar as appealed from is reversed. (July 18, 1958)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and mail between New York and a number of cities in the South. Maintaining its
principal office in Miami, it operates branch offices at each station on its
route and, in the New York City area, at LaGuardia and Idlewild airports and
several places in Manhattan. National also maintains a facility employing
mechanics and cleaners at a hangar at the Idlewild Airports. The claimants in
this case are the ticket agents, reservation clerks, and baggage clerks

represented by one union, the Airline Agents Association International, the
hangar personnel by another and separate labor organization, the International
Association of Machinists, AFL-CIO. The industrial controversy, involving only
the Airline Agents Association and National, originated as follows: On April 1,
1957,the collective bargaining agreement between National and the Association
expired. Negotiations for a renewal of the agreement were carried on over a
period of several months but without success. On September 18 and 19, 1958,
without authorization of the union, a number of the clerks employed in the Idlewild
office discontinued or failed to report for work. Between September 20 and 22,
other members of the Association employed at several of National's southern
offices also stopped work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(from September 18 to September 23), however, National continued to operate its
ticket office at Idlewild with supervisory personnel; its Manhattan ticket
office, as well as the hangar at Idlewild, continued to operate with their
regular personnel. On September 23, however, National discontinued all of its
operations and, with certain exceptions not here relevant, furloughed all of
its personnel, including the clerks in the Manhattan office and the Idlewild

Idlewild, the instigators of the walkout, the clerks at Manhattan and the
hangar employees filed their respective claims for unemployment compensation.
Th Industrial Commissioner administratively denied benefits to all of the
claimants for a seven-week period on the ground that an &quot;industrial
controversy&quot; existed within the &quot;establishment&quot; of the employer
within the meaning of section 592,subdivision 1. The Unemployment Insurance
Referee and, thereafter, the Appeal Board overruled the Commissioner with
respect to the Manhattan clerks. The Appellate Division modified the Board's

the claimants employed at the Idlewild hangar and those employed at the
Manhattan office seek to establish that their loss of employment did not take
place &quot;because of a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy&quot;
involving the Idlewild clerks, but resulted rather from the employee stoppages
at National's southern offices. It may not be disputed that the industrial
controversy involved herein originated with the Idlewild clerks' refusal to
work. Their continued absence from work was clearly a contributing factor in
the ultimate layoff of claimants and, for purposes of this decision, it is
unnecessary to determine whether the layoff of the claimants resulted solely
from that walkout. At least one of the causes underlying the claimants' loss of
employment was the industrial controversy involving the Idlewild clerks. The
first element being established, we turn to a consideration of the second: are
the Manhattan office and the Idlewild hangar facilities within the same
&quot;establishment&quot; as the Idlewild office?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The appellants, although
seeking to reverse the order of the Appellate Division, urge different grounds
in support of their respective contentions. The Industrial Commissioner argues
that the phrase &quot;containing the word&nbsp;<u>'establishment'</u>&nbsp;should
be given a definition of sufficient breadth to include employees whose
continuance at their jobs has become useless, or economically wasteful, while
the strike lasts, and&nbsp;<u>'because of'</u>&nbsp;it.&quot; The employer
argues, in essence, that since the airline operations are of necessity
integrated for the purpose of reserving and selling airline space and
ultimately furnishing transportation, each &quot;station&quot; - that is, each
metropolitan area in which the airline has facilities - constitutes a single
establishment. As opposed to these contentions, the claimants maintain that the
term &quot;establishment&quot; is to be construed in spatial or geographic
terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>To adopt that broad
interpretation advanced by the Commissioner would obliterate the carefully
delineated distinction which the statute seeks to draw between the phrase
&quot;in the establishment in which [the claimant] was employed&quot; and the
phrase &quot;because of a strike.&quot; Under his construction, one or the
other of the two tests for a suspension would become superfluous. Manifestly,
therefore, the statutory language itself requires rejection of this
interpretation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The employer's argument
that, since all operations within each station &quot;operated as a single
integrated unit,&quot; each station constituted a single establishment must
also fail. Essentially, it is the contention which was advanced in&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Machcinski (Ford Motor Co</u>.) (277 App. Div. 364, 643) and there rejected
on the ground that the word &quot;establishment&quot; as used in the statute
means the &quot;place where the employee was last employed.&quot; In this case,
too, the Appellate Division, in rejecting the contention and in concluding that
the Manhattan office, the Idlewild office and the Idlewild hangar were separate
establishments, reasoned that the Legislature &quot;did not mean by
'establishment' the whole compass of a large employer's business institution
where it operates in differently localized components. The word 'establishment'
has strong local connotations.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Although the statute
furnishes no definitive answer as to whether the term &quot;establishment&quot;
is to be given an all-encompassing meaning equated with &quot;enterprise&quot;
or a more limited spatial meaning equated with &quot;place&quot; and although
the dictionary provides definitions which fit either alternative, it is clear
that &quot;establishment&quot; is to be equated with place or situs. The
Unemployment Insurance Law is a remedial statute designed to protect the wage
earner from the hazards of unemployment by providing money benefits to
individuals &quot;unemployed trough no fault of their own&quot; (Labor Law
§501). Conversely, only claimants who are unemployed through fault of their own
- such as employees who voluntarily quit their jobs or who refuse employment
without good cause or who are discharged for misconduct - are denied benefits
under the statute (§593 and §594).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Subdivision 1 of section
592, constituting the only exception to this statutory tenet, represents this
State's reconciliation of the purposes of unemployment insurance with the
principle of governmental neutrality, a principle which runs through all labor
relations laws. In the interest of preserving that neutrality between a
contesting employer and employees and irrespective of individual need, that
provision withdraws benefits under certain limited circumstances there spelled
out. The State must stand aside, at least during the early stages of an
industrial controversy, and thereby avoid the imputation that a dispute may be
financed through unemployment insurance benefits. (See&nbsp;<u>Matter or Burger
[Corsi</u>], 277 App. Div. 234,236, affd. 303 N.Y. 654)). The exception, the
suspension of benefits otherwise provided for, must be narrowly construed to
effectuate the broad humanitarian objectives sought to be achieved by the
statute. So read, it is evident that the term &quot;establishment&quot; is to
be defined in geographic terms rather than in terms of corporate organization
or exercise of management powers and functions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>This conclusion is
confirmed by reference to the manifest design of the Legislature to provide a
rule which may be expeditiously applied. Suspension under section 592 demands
proof neither of industrial participation in, or financial aid to, the
industrial controversy nor interest in its outcome. Suspension may, perhaps, be
invoked even though claimants be separately represented for bargaining
purposes. The administrator is thereby spared the need for making either
complex or abstract administrative determinations which reference to individual
involvement, participation or interest would require. Moreover, the geographic
concept of &quot;establishment,&quot; looking only to concrete facts, better
fits the legislative purpose of simplicity of administration than does a
concept which would require determinations regarding functional
&quot;interdependence,&quot; &quot;integration&quot; or &quot;entity.&quot;
Finally, apart from the fact that the term &quot;establishment,&quot; defined
in geographic terms, is more expeditiously interpreted and applied by the
Industrial Commissioner, it is more easily understood by both employee and
employer, the persons to whom it is to apply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>To construe
&quot;establishment&quot; as denoting space or place is also more appropriate
to the use of the term in other provisions of the statute. For instance,
section 593, subdivision 2(b), providing that a claimant, who refuses
employment &quot;because of a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy
in the establishment&quot; in which it is offered, shall be deemed to have
refused employment for good cause and shall not be denied benefit rights. The
broad definition of establishment sought by the employer in this case would, if
applied to the last mentioned provision, enable employees to reject appropriate
employment and still continue to draw unemployment benefits - a result
obviously never intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In addition to the fact,
already noted, that the Appellate Division previously decided that the term
&quot;establishment&quot; is to be interpreted in the geographic rather than in
the functional or managerial sense (see&nbsp;<u>Mater of Machcinski</u>&nbsp;[<u>Ford
Motor Co</u>], 277 App. Div. 634, 643-644, supra;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Lasher
[Bethlehem</u>&nbsp;<u>Steel Co.]</u>, 279 App. div. 505,507), it is of some
significance that the Legislature has resisted a number of attempts - first
initiated shortly after the&nbsp;<u>Machcinski</u>&nbsp;decision - to amend the
statute so as to extend the scope and content of the term
&quot;establishment&quot; and the consequent suspension of benefits. (See,
e.g., 1953, A. 1807, Pr. 1868; 1957, A. 3854, Pr. 3996; 1959; A. 3162, Pr.
3220; 1960; A. 2753, Pr. 2805; 1961, A. 2043, Pr. 2139).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Applying the principles
set forth above to the facts in the case before us, there can be no doubt that
the clerks in the Idlewild office and the mechanics in the Idlewild hangar, two
and a half miles from the terminal building's ticket facilities, were not
employed in the same establishment. And that, of course, is also true of the
Manhattan clerks ten miles away. The fact that they belonged to the same union
as the Idlewild clerks is without significance in view of the geographical
connotation to be given the work &quot;establishment.&quot; In other words, the
industrial controversy involving the clerks at the airline's terminal office at
Idlewild did not occur in the same establishment as that in which either the
Idlewild mechanics and cleaners or the Manhattan clerks were employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the employer's inability to deliver finished steel across the picket lines
at the construction sites, there was a backing up of steel at the fabrication
plant. A production cutback became necessary, and on July 25, approximately
five weeks after the strike had begun, the employer laid off claimant and
eleven other workers at the fabrication plant. The employer continued to
operate the fabrication plant with approximately three fourths of the work
