"Times New Roman";color:black'>: For two and one-half years ending August 1948
claimant was employed as an employment interviewer by the New York State
Employment Service. Thereafter, claimant temporarily withdrew from the labor
market. On October 4, 1949 claimant returned to the labor market. She filed a
claim for benefits and registered for employment. She was classified by the
employment service as an employment interviewer. The normal work week for an
employment interviewer both in public and private industry does not include
Sundays. On November 2, 1949 claimant was hired by the Division of Placement
and Unemployment Insurance as an employment interviewer. Her employment was to
commence on November 7, 1949. On Saturday evening, November 5, claimant
suddenly became ill and failed to commence her employment. Thereafter, based
upon an interview with the claimant, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from benefits from the date of the filing
of her claim on the ground that she was unavailable for employment. Claimant
contested the initial determination and requested a hearing. The referee
modified the initial determination of the local office by holding that claimant
was available for employment from the date of her filing to and including
Sunday, November 6, 1949. He held that she was unavailable for employment
thereafter. The industrial Commissioner thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In a brief filed with the Board, the
Industrial Commissioner limits his appeal solely to the issue as to whether or
not claimant should be credited with Sunday, November 6, as a day of total
unemployment, in view of her admission that she was incapable of employment on
that day. In determining the question raised on this appeal, we must consider
the Unemployment Insurance Law and its application. The following sections of
the Law are pertinent to this issue. Section 524 of the Unemployment Insurance
Law defines week as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>TOTAL
UNEMPLOYMENT. &quot;Total Unemployment&quot; means the total lack of any
employment on any day, caused by the inability of a claimant who is capable of
and available for work to engage in his usual employment or in any other for
which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience. The term
&quot;employment&quot; as used in this section means any employment including
that not defined in this title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is the contention of
the Industrial Commissioner that the provisions contained in Section 522 and
524 of the Unemployment Insurance Law impliedly hold that a claimant must be
available for employment on Sunday. By Section 501 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law, the Legislature directs that as a guide to the interpretation
and application of the Unemployment Insurance Law, the public policy of this
State is to pay unemployment insurance benefits to persons unemployed through
no fault of their own. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania is interpreting the
provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Compensation Law of Pennsylvania,
which is similar to the Unemployment Insurance Law of the State of New York
stated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Unemployment
compensation cannot be administered upon vague theories imported from other and
unrelated realms of the law. The Unemployment Compensation Law represents
&quot;the exercise of the police powers of the Commonwealth&quot; to abolish:
&quot;Economic insecurity due to unemployment [which] is a serious menace to
the health, morals, and welfare of the people of the Commonwealth.&quot; Id.
§3, 43 PS §752. Although it brings advantages to the Commonwealth and its
political subdivisions by relieving them of the burden of increased poor relief
assistance, it is designed primarily for the benefit of the worker upon whom
unemployment &quot;falls with crushing force.&quot; Id.&nbsp;<u>These benefits
must not be denied by fanciful, strained, unnatural, distorted or mere
technical construction. It is a remedial statute, and excepting the sections
imposing taxes, its provisions must be liberally and broadly construed so that
its objective may be completely achieved.</u>&nbsp;We cannot approve an
administrative construction, which denies compensation to an unemployed worker
unless the plain language of the statute clearly excludes him from its
benefits. (William H. MacFarland, v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review,
158 Pa. Super, 418) (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We
believe that these provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law must be
interpreted in a reasonable and socially desirable manner. Under the
Commissioner’s interpretation of the Law, a claimant who spends his Sunday in
church, in prayer and meditation, is technically unavailable for employment.
Likewise a claimant who takes his family to a seashore resort on a Sunday would
be deemed unavailable for employment and forfeit his benefit rights for that
day, even though acceptance of employment by him on that day might be a
violation of the Penal Law, as is the case of a barber.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is
true that the statutory week is defined as &quot;seven consecutive days
beginning with Monday.&quot; But the limitation of claimant’s benefit rights to
four effective days within each week is based in part upon the recognition that
the major part of industry in the State of New York operates on a five-day week
basis (Appeal Board, 10,925-44). It was never intended by these provisions of
the Unemployment Insurance Law that claimants’ work week be extended to seven
days, nor was it expected that they must hold themselves available for
employment entailing seven days of work during each week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the claimant herein had a right to leave for a vacation on Sunday, the
last day of the statutory week and her usual day of rest, without forfeiting
her full benefit check for that week. She already had fulfilled the statutory
provisions contained in the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the so-called Sunday Laws may be said to have had a religious origin, our
statute since 1881 (Penal Code, §259, now Penal Law, §2140) has also recognized
that the first day of the week by general consent is set apart &quot;for
rest&quot;, in accord with the general experience of mankind that it is wise
and necessary to set apart such day at stated intervals for both the physical
and moral welfare of the individual of a State or community. The power of the
Legislature to regulate the observance of Sunday as a civil and political
institution is well settled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that Sunday is recognized generally as a day of rest and therefore claimant
need not be capable of an available for employment on Sunday. This would not
necessarily follow in trades, which normally operate on Sundays. Under the
circumstances, claimant should be credited with Sunday, November 6, 1949 as a
day of total unemployment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not entitled to a benefit check. The factual difference, that is the fact that
in A.B. 13,309-49 the claimant died immediately after the days in question does
not appear to be any basis for a sound differentiation. Therefore, since the
instant decision reflects the current thoughts of the Appeal Board and is also
in conformity with the principle stated in Appeal Board 15,763-49 (which was
resolved subsequent to A.B. 13,309-46) Appeal Board decision 13,309-46 has been

     employment on a Thursday is allowed Saturday and Sunday as effective days.
     Likewise, a claimant who was last employed on a pattern of a five-day week
     and who was unwilling to work more than five days per week was held to be
     entitled to four effective days in each statutory week (A.B. 12,143-45).
     However, attention is directed to the fact that a claimant who is
     unwilling to work more than three days a week is ineligible for benefits
     (A.B. 9358-43; Index 755-D2; Serial No. A-750-462). Also, a claimant who
     is willing to work only four days per week should be credited with only
     one effective day per week. (A.B. 11,548-45)<o:p></o:p></span></li>

Day Base Plan, leaving three days of unemployment in a week uncompensated,

It does not presuppose that a claimant would or should work seven days each

a claimant is, technically, incapable or unavailable on the customary days of
rest, or that such days are included in a period of &quot;employment&quot;

college with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1947 and 1948, he worked as an
adjuster in a camera plant in Binghamton, New York. Thereafter from March to
July 1949, he worked as a nurseryman in Johnson City, New York. Claimant filed
an additional claim for benefits on August 25, 1949 in South Bend, Indiana
against New York as the liable State. He had moved to South Bend, where he now
resides with his wife and child with the intention of pursuing a graduate
course at the University of Notre Dame. He matriculated at the University on
September 16, 1949. In registering for employment, he informed the Indiana
office that he was available for work on any shift after 3:00 p.m. Claimant
filed application for employment at various industrial plants in the immediate
vicinity. He sought work at an automobile manufacturing plant, a rubber
manufacturing plant, a large machine works, and a sewing machine factory and
also through the University. He was available for full-time work on either the
afternoon or evening shifts. Information was received from an official of the
Indiana State Employment Service that it was the policy of local employers not
to hire college students. Subsequent to the referee’s hearing, information was
received that such policy was not adhered to and that it was not uncommon for
local employers to give employment to college students. Claimant furnished a
statement signed by six fellow students who were so employed at an automobile
works and at a rubber factory. Claimant continued his search for employment and
in April 1950 succeeded in finding work at an automobile factory on the second
shift from 4 p. m. to 12:30 a.m. At the same time, he continued pursuing a
full-time course in graduate work at the University. Claimant reported for
unemployment insurance purposes only to December 10, 1949. He stated that he
wanted a salary of at least $45 per week. By initial determination he was ruled
unavailable for employment and overpaid in benefits for the weeks ending
September 18 and September 25, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for employment because he removed himself to a new locality where his prospects
of obtaining work were limited by the fact that he could only work on the
second or third shift and further by the reluctance of employers to hire
students. He stated that claimant also restricted his employability by imposing
salary restrictions. We cannot agree with the referee’s conclusions. Claimant,
a married man with a family to support, did remove to an industrial area so
that he might pursue graduate work in a University there. Prior thereto, he had
worked for about two years and there can be no question that he intended to
continue working while pursuing hi studies. Claimant was available for either
of two full-time shifts and there were a number of nearby plants which had such
shifts. He did eventually obtain full-time work on the afternoon shift in one
of such plants. There is no evidence that claimant at any time imposed any
unreasonable salary or other restrictions. It cannot be said that his
expression of a wage of $45 per week limited in any way his chances of finding
employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employed for about four years to August 1, 1950. There were about 40 other wire
weavers employed in the department in which claimant worked. Prior to August 1,
1950, the personnel, including claimant, worked on a five-day night shift. The
establishment was unionized and claimant was a member of the union. The
employer, because of commitments, increased the working schedule to six nights
a week, which included Saturday. For the additional working hours the employer
paid time and a half. The personnel accepted this change, but the claimant did
not. Claimant left his job because he objected to working Saturday nights since
it would have interfered with his outside social activities. Claimant is single
and in good physical health. Claimant conceded that he complained to his union
but without any result. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on August 7, 1950.
The local office issued an initial determination disqualifying him from
receiving benefits for 42 days, effective August 7, 1950, on the ground that he
voluntarily left his employment without good cause. Claimant requested a
hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination and the Industrial

a bilingual stenographer. In connection with her duties, she took dictation in,
typed and translated English and Spanish, the latter being her native language.
She last worked far about six months ending October 26, 1949 for an export firm
in New York City as a Spanish-English stenographer earning $55 a week. She left
this employment due to pregnancy. Her child was born March 12, 1950. Claimant
filed an additional claim for benefits and registered for employment on April
26, 1950. She was classified as a stenographer. On May 3, 1950, claimant was
referred to a job as an English stenographer for an importing concern paying
$45 for a five-day week with a $5 increase after three months. Claimant refused
the referral because the job did not require Spanish translation in which she
specialized and the wages offered were inadequate. The local office issued an
initial determination that claimant refused employment on May 3, 1950. It also
issued an alternate determination that claimant was unavailable for employment
effective the same date. Claimant protested am requested a hearing before the
referee. At conferences at the employment office and the insurance office
claimant restricted herself to a minimum salary of $55 a week. At the hearing
before the referee she testified that in view of her expenses she would not
accept less than $50 a week. The wages paid to stenographers generally in the
locality range from $40 to $45 a week. Bi-lingual stenographers earn $50 a
week. Claimant consulted the advertisements in the newspaper in her efforts to
obtain work. She did not contact any private employment agencies specializing
in placing bi-lingual stenographers because the fees were too high, although
she secured her last job through such an agency. Most of the advertisements in
newspapers for bi-lingual stenographers were inserted by fee paying agencies.
Claimant stated that in the event she obtained employment, her sister-in-law
would attend to her child, for which she would have to pay $10 a week. The
sister-in-law has three children, aged three, two and five months. Her taxi
fare for transporting claimant and her child from her home to her
sister-in-law’s residence each morning would be $1 per trip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The referee ruled that
claimant had good cause to refuse the employment of May 3, 1950 since the work
did not utilize her command of the Spanish language and the remuneration
offered was substantially less than that generally prevailing for Spanish-English
stenographers. He also held that claimant had made suitable arrangements for
the care of her child and that she was available for employment. We are unable
to agree fully with the referee’s disposition of this case. We believe he
properly held that claimant’s refusal of the job offered was with good cause,
within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The facts, however,
support the contention of the Industrial Commissioner that claimant was
unavailable for employment. Her child was not yet two months old at the date
claimant filed a claim for benefits. She had made no practical arrangements for
the care of her baby. It is difficult to believe that she would take her child

business was open six days a week, from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 or 5:30 p.m. During
the last two years, claimant had no employees, and he was in sole charge of his
establishment. While engaged in this business venture claimant, from time to time,
accepted a limited number of musical engagements as a union musician with
orchestras performing in the City of New York. Claimant’s earnings from musical
engagements as a union musician during 1949 amounted to $1,342.75. In between
such engagements claimant filed application for unemployment insurance
benefits. The original claim in issue was filed on April 26, 1949 and by a
number of refilings, claimant collected the sum of $676 through the period
ending March 19, 1950. On April 27, 1950, the local office issued an initial
determination holding that claimant was not totally unemployed during the
period in issue and that he was unavailable for employment and all the benefits
he received constituted an overpayment. Claimant contested the initial determination
and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination and
the Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

engaged after his usual business hours. During the periods he was a claimant
for benefits, he devoted full time to the operation of his business, which was
at all times his primary interest and his main source of livelihood. Under

representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant,
a baker, filed for benefits on November 13, 1950. By initial determination
effective that date, he was disqualified for 42 days for leaving employment
voluntarily. Prior to filing for benefits, claimant last worked in July 1949.
He left the job to go to Italy to visit his aged mother who was critically ill
and who desired to see him. Claimant had not seen his mother for many years.
His mother was most anxious to have him come to visit her because she feared
she would not survive long enough for her to see him again if she did not see
him then. Claimant submitted a statement from the doctor who attended his
mother, indicating the severity of her ailment and the fact that it was
necessary for claimant to remain at her side until her health was sufficiently

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The case before me is
distinguishable from Appeal Board, 21,840-49. The claimant in the cited case
went to Sweden to visit relatives whom he had not seen for may years. There was
no pressing reason for claimant’s gong there, except his long absence away from
his family. To claimant’s mother it was a vital matter that he see her. The
filial relationship in the case before me was a greater bond and of more
compelling circumstance than the fraternal relationship in the case cited. It
is held that claimant had good compelling reason to leave his job under the
circumstances, and that he did not leave his employment voluntarily without
good cause. The initial determination is overruled. (March 20, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     to determine whether leave of absence would have been granted and whether

     arbitrarily quitting is generally the action of a reasonably prudent
     person. The absence of such request when it would have been granted,
     together with the absence of any credible reason for failure to do so,
     could be considered a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause.

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which the claimant and
representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant
filed for benefits on August 1,1949. By an initial determination effective
September 26, 1949, he was ruled ineligible as unavailable for employment
because he was self-employed. Claimant, in 1938, obtained a degree of Bachelor
of Science in education. He was thereafter employed as an adult education
teacher. With the exception of the period when he was in the armed forces, he
obtained employment practically every summer in entertainment work at summer
resorts. He wrote and produced shows and also acted in the same. He was
employed professionally, in radio. He wrote a vaudeville act in which he and
two other persons participated. He went on tour with this act for several
seasons. While in the armed forces, claimant was assigned to special services
where he wrote, directed and produced stage and road shows, and was otherwise
active with respect to recreation work. Following his discharge from the armed
forces, in February 1946, claimant obtained employment with a textile
converting firm. He was an inside man supervising stock in the shipping and
receiving department. His salary was $60 a week plus bonuses. This employment
continued until May 1949, when claimant was laid off, because of a general
falling off in activities by his employer. Claimant had accepted this
employment as a means of supporting himself and his family during his
readjustment to civilian life. Claimant was able to perform his duties with the
textile company to the satisfaction of his employer. He soon recognized that he
had no particular aptitude for this work, and decided to return to that field
of work for which he had been trained, namely, the field of writing. He filed a
claim for readjustment allowances as an unemployed veteran and received
allowances on this filing until the end of July 1949. Thereafter, he filed the
instant claim as an unemployed civilian. Claimant realized that he was unable
to immediately obtain employment as a writer in the radio, television or
theatrical fields. He made arrangements to collaborate with another writer who
had successfully sold stories. Claimant, thereafter, occupied himself by
writing and canvassing agents. Claimant is not interested in making a sale of
any given material which he has written. He is primarily interested in making
arrangements to work as a writer in connection with a continuing radio or
television program. Whatever compensation he expects to receive would come to
him from the sponsor of the program which he, alone, or with his collaborator,
would write. With respect to both activities, claimant regularly called upon
the agents, to whom radio and television shows, which he had written, had been
submitted. Through the general manager of one of the principal operators of
legitimate theaters in New York City, he sought employment as an assistant
stage manager.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Through a personal
friend who was employed by advertising agency, he sought employment as a copy
writer. Claimant was willing to accept employment in any of the above types of
work, or, even as a supervisor in shipping and receiving provided he received
what he considered a living wage of, at least, $50 per week. There is evidence
that customary wages being paid to supervising shipping clerks in the textile
field range from $45 to $50 per week. Claimant did not make any independent
efforts to obtain work as a supervising shipping clerk, because he considered
that this would be a diversion from that field for which he was best qualified.
Had he been offered such employment, he would have accepted the same and used
his remaining time to try to obtain employment in the writing field. He
reported to the employment office on September 27, October 4 and 10. No job
offers were made to him on any occasions. Claimant’s writing activities did not
interfere with his seeking employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the issuance of the initial determination, herein, is that with respect to his

employment. The credible evidence does not substantiate this theory. Even if it
were to be held that claimant is self-employed, it does not necessarily follow
that his activities with respect thereto are such as to prevent his accepting
employment. His desire to obtain employment in the field for which he was
educated and trained in both understandable and reasonable. This also explains
his reluctance to accept employment in the commercial work. Considering the
evidence as a while, it cannot be said that claimant established such
unreasonable or undue restrictions with respect to his employability as to
render him unavailable for employment within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. It is to be noted that claimant had paid employment history
which involved the type of work he was seeking. The initial determination is
overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Industrial Commissioner from the decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board overruling an initial determination made by the Industrial Commissioner
that claimant was ineligible to receive benefits on the ground that he was
unavailable for employment. Claimant had participated as a writer and performer
in vaudeville and television shows at college, at various summer resorts and in
the armed services. Following his discharge from the army claimant obtained
work at $60 per week with a textile firm, and continued in this employment for
approximately three years until he was laid off because of a seasonal lull.
Claimant did not return to work for the former employer in the textile industry
and admitted upon the hearing that he had not looked for work at all in the
textile field. Claimant testified: &quot;I don’t wish to return to industry
again. I wish to be a professional writer and I am seeking that type of
work.&quot; Under these circumstances claimant withdrew from the labor market
and rendered himself unavailable for employment for which he was reasonably
fitted by training and experience, and is not entitled to unemployment benefits
within the spirit and purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Decision of
the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board reversed, on the law, and the initial
determination of the Industrial Commissioner reinstated, without costs. (March
14,1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     (Rev.) (Index Nos. 1640C-5 and 1640E-3), Appellate Division Decision
     (Matter of Pillersdorf) wherein the Court stated that a haberdashery
     salesman who acquired a law degree upon attending night school while
     working did not have good cause to leave his employment in order to seek
     employment with law firms. In that case, the Court stated that claimant
     voluntarily left his employment without good cause and further added that
     &quot;had the employment service offered him another job in that industry,
     he would have to take it or suffer the loss of his benefits&quot;.<br>
     <br>
     That decision and the instant case, although entirely identical issues are
     not presented, point to a definite principle which has not generally been
     applied in the past. Since an analysis of these two decisions shows that
     no mention was made as to the chances of securing the desired employment,
     or as to existing employment opportunities in such field, it can be
     concluded that no significance attaches to that factor. It appears,
     therefore, that a claimant who restricts himself to occupations in which
     he has no or no recent work experience, generally, does not meet the
     statutory tests without regard to other surrounding circumstances,
     including the possession of other skills, licenses or training.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant had worked for several years as a
merchandiser and as an assistant to the head of the department in a chain
retail store. He last worked in New York City from February 1949 to march 31,
1949 as merchandise distribution manager. He left this employment to go into
business in Florida. On April 15, 1949 claimant opened a combination gasoline
station and sundry store in Jacksonville, Florida. His wife assisted him in
connection with the operation of the business. From September 1949 the business
was operated at a loss. In February 1950 claimant was desirous of obtaining
private employment. Claimant filed a claim for benefits in Florida against New
York as the liable State on February 14, 1950 and reported to March 29, 1950.
During this period claimant certified each week at the Florida employment
office that he was self-employed. The Out-of-State Resident Unit issued an
initial determination effective February 14, 1950 that claimant was unavailable
for employment. The basis of the determination was that claimant was
self-employed. Claimant protested and requested a hearing before a referee.
Claimant exerted efforts to obtain full-time employment by registering with
private employment agencies, by applying at several department stores and by
answering advertisements in the newspaper. He wanted a job paying from $50 to
$60 a week. He stated that in the event he obtained employment his wife would
operate the business until it was liquidated. During his reporting period
claimant devoted most of his time to the management of his business. On March
27, 1950 claimant obtained employment as a census enumerator. He closed out his
business on April 1, 1950. He worked to May 12, 1950 after which he refiled for
benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant was available for employment from February 14, 1950 to march 26, 1950.
The referee overruled the initial determination on the premise that claimant
made efforts to secure work and obtained employment on his own initiative and
that his self-employment was no deterrent to his accepting employment. The
Commissioner urges that claimant was, nevertheless, unavailable for employment
because of his active participation in his business during the period in
question. We believe that the Commissioner’s position is well taken. The Board
was confronted with an analogous situation in Appeal Board, 23,493-50 in which
we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

justified in this conclusion that claimant would have accepted full-time
employment had it been offered to him, nevertheless it clearly appears that
claimant devoted his entire time to the business of the partnership. Claimant’s
situation does not differ from that of any other person who has full-time
employment but is willing to abandon such employment for more remunerative
pursuits. Under the circumstances herein, it cannot be said that claimant,
while devoting his full time to the business of the partnership was in fact
available for employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last employment on January 10, 1950, because the work affected her eyes. She
had been employed as a stone setter on costume jewelry for three years. She had
no other work experience. Claimant filed a claim for benefits and registered
for employment on January 17, 1950. On January 30, 1950, she was referred to
employment involving the same kind of work that she had left because of the
condition of her eyes. Medical evidence substantiates claimant's contention
that she can no longer work in her regular line because of its effect on her
eyes. At local office interviews on February 7, 1950, April 10, 1950 and at the
hearing before the referee, claimant stated that she will not work for less
than $35 a week; that she will not accept $33 a week. She is willing to learn
the work of a packer or a finisher on women's clothes. Entrance wages for
packers are 75 cents an hour and for finishers $28.70 for a 35 hour week. An
initial determination was issued disqualifying her from benefits effective
January 30, 1950, on the ground that claimant's salary demand was unreasonable
and rendered her unavailable for employment. At an interview at the local
office on April 25, 1950, claimant reiterated that she cannot do work in her
regular line as a stone setter, and that she sought work as a packer or
finisher on dresses and has been unable to obtain it because of the lack of her
experience in such work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

available for employment and that her wage demand of $35 a week was not an
unreasonable desire in view of her former earnings. On the basis of the record
herein, we cannot accept his conclusion. Claimant demanded a wage of $35 per
week as a packer or finisher which she was willing to learn but as to which the
entrance rate of pay was 75 cents an hour and $28.70 per 35 hour week
respectively. She was not willing to accept $33 a week. It appears, from the
evidence, that this wage demand was inflexible. Claimant has no work history or
experience other than that of a stone setter, which work she can no longer
perform because of her eyes. Therefore she would be required to enter a new
labor market without experience. Her wage demand is substantially greater than
the entrance wage for the new type of work she is willing and able to perform.
We hold that claimant, in effect, precluded herself from possible employment
and was properly disqualified from receiving benefits. Inasmuch as claimant is
held unavailable by virtue of her statements at local office interviews, we fix
the effective date thereof to be February 7, 1950.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

directions from his physician to refrain from heavy work during the period of
recovery from his operation. Such precautions were essential to assure
restoration to good health and to prevent the opening of the incision. We do
not believe that claimant would have disregarded his physician's instructions.
Claimant is a building construction laborer and has no other work experience.
This is a field of hard labor. There is no such thing as an &quot;easy
job&quot; for a building laborer. In order to secure light work claimant would
be required to go into another employment field. We doubt that he could find
employment in another field at a rate of pay that would be satisfactory to him.
While we have previously held that physical handicaps do not, under all
circumstances, render claimant unavailable for employment, in the instant case,
however, claimant's unwillingness to consider a job as a watchman at $18 a week
and his statement that he would like a job at $30 to $35 a week erected barriers
that rendered him unavailable for employment during the period in question.
There is no reasonable opportunity of securing employment for him under these
circumstances.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer, by its co-partner, and representative of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a finisher on blouses, filed an
original claim for benefits effective June 19, 1950. By initial determination
effective June 19, 1950, she was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving
of employment and withdrawal from the labor market commencing with the Date she
certified to a&nbsp;<u>bona fide</u>&nbsp;return to the labor market and as to
her availability for employment. Prior to June 19, 1950, claimant was employed
for about nine and a half months to June 15, 1950. She was employed in a union
shop. The employer is a member of a contractor’s association and has a union
agreement with Local 25, of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
About one week prior to June 15 the employer informed the claimant that she
would have to join the union in order to retain her job. Claimant refused to
join the union and left the employment. She could have remained in the
employment had she joined the union. This employment was the first job claimant
had had for ten years. The job was in the neighborhood of her residence. For
the past ten years the claimant has been keeping house for her nephew and her
niece. She states that she does not want work outside her neighborhood and will
not join the union. The industry in which claimant is employed is about 90
percent unionized. Claimant was employed on a piece work basis and averaged $28
to $40 a week. The union dues were $3 a month. Claimant contended that she was
discharged because she refused to join the union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

withdrawal from the labor market. The initial determination is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testimony was
taken. Claimant, a sewing machine operator, and a licensed hairdresser, filed a
claim for benefits effective November 9, 1949. She received two benefits on
that filing through December 4. She was disqualified for refusal of employment
by initial determination effective December 6, 1949. On December 6, 1949,
claimant was offered employment as a sewing machine operator on women’s shirts
in a union shop. The pay was at piecework rates at union scale for a five-day
week of 35 hours. Claimant refused the referral because she wants a job as a
hairdresser. Claimant was employed as a sewing machine operator for four years.
She was laid off because business was slow in November 1948. Claimant does not
want to work in the needle trades any more because she claims it affects her
eyes. Claimant has completed a course in which she had 1000 hours of training
as a hairdresser and beauty culturist. She paid $350 for the course. After the
completion of the course she took an examination offered by the State of New
York for a license. She was subsequently licensed by the State of New York as a
hairdresser in August 1949. She has not been able to find employment as a
hairdresser. Claimant was formerly a member of the union in the needle trades
but allowed her membership to lapse. For some time after her last employment,
claimant was self-employed operating a vegetable store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The job offered
claimant was one for which she was fitted by reason of her training and
experience since she had four years’ experience in the job. The wages offered
were union scale and therefore not substantially less than those prevailing for
such work in the locality. However, since the claimant had paid $350 for a
training course and had spent 1000 hours in training, passed an examination
given by the State, and received a license as a hairdresser, she is entitled to
a reasonable time to seek such employment. Claimant’s seeking a new occupation
is a legitimate aspiration and there is no reason why she should be confined
forever to the needle trade. Claimant has shown her sincerity in seeking a new
line of work by efforts to prepare herself to be a hairdresser. Claimant’s
refusal of the employment because she wanted to continue to seek employment as
a hairdresser was god cause for refusing the employment offered. The initial
determination is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: For about four years
the claimant was employed as a sewing machine operator working on women’s
skirts. In November 1948 she left this employment and some time later entered
the vegetable business on her own account. This business did not succeed and
was sold by claimant. During the time she was working as a machine operator and
thereafter, claimant took a course in hairdressing and she received a license
to do this work in August 1949. She testified she did not obtain work as a
hairdresser because the hairdressing shops wanted experienced technicians, and
although claimant had training and a license, she had no experience. Unable to
find an opening in this field, she filed a claim for unemployment insurance
benefits November 9, 1949 and received two benefit payments. On December 6,
1949 she was offered employment as a sewing machine operator in a union shop
under standard conditions in that trade which she refused on the ground she
wanted to acquire experience in hairdressing. The record of the placement
office shows there was then no available employment for inexperienced
hairdressers, and the Industrial Commissioner thereupon disallowed benefits on
the ground claimant had refused to accept an offer of employment for which she
was reasonably fitted by training and experience. The unemployment insurance
referee overruled this determination for the reason that claimant &quot;is
entitled to a reasonable time to seek such employment&quot; (as a hairdresser.
He concluded that her refusal of the employment offered was for good cause. The
appeal board affirmed this determination. The statute does not allow so
selective a refusal of employment. It prohibits the payment of benefits where,
without good cause, there is a refusal of an offer of employment for which a
claimant &quot;is reasonably fitted by training and experience&quot; with exceptions
not germane here (Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 593, subd. 2). Where a
person is reasonably fitted for more than one kind of employment he does not
bring himself within the benefits provided by the statute if he refuses one
kind merely because he prefers the other. And where one kind is shown to be
available, and to have been offered, and the other is not at the time available
because of a lack of personal experience, it is not unreasonable to require, as
an alternative to unemployment benefits, that at such a time, at least, the
kind of employment that is offered be taken until the kind that claimant
prefers be available. The refusal here was not good cause as a matter of law.
The decision should be reversed and the initial determination of the
Commissioner reinstated without costs. (May 9, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

offered to claimant involved work for which she was reasonably fitted by
training and experience. The referee further determined that the wage rate was
not substantially less favorable to the claimant than that prevailing for
similar work in the locality. We are in accord with this view. However, the
referee held that claimant was justified in refusing the proffered employment
since the fare for transportation, including bus and subway, amounted to 64¢ a
day. The referee reasoned that the travel expense was substantially greater
than that required in claimant’s former employment and that the additional
expenditure was not provided for. Concededly, the expense of transportation in
connection with the employment in question would have been considerably in
excess of the fare required in claimant’s previous employment. However, such
additional expenditure was necessitated by reason of claimant’s removal from
New York City to her present residence in North Bergen, New Jersey. In our
opinion, it was not the legislative intent to make Section 593.2 (c) of the
Unemployment Insurance Law applicable to a situation such as the one presented
herein. Furthermore, the record shows that claimant made little or no effort to
obtain employment in the neighborhood of her residence. Upon all the facts and
circumstances herein, we believe claimant refused employment without good

determinations herein on the ground that the unemployment of the claimants was
due to a stoppage of work which existed as a result of a labor dispute at the
establishment where they were last employed. The question on appeal is whether
or not there was a strike or industrial controversy in the
&quot;establishment&quot; in which the claimants were employed within the
meaning of Section 592.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. This question was
the subject of a recent Court decision which we believe to be determinative of
the present case. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Machcinski, et al vs. Ford Motor Company</u>,
277 App. Div. 634, affirming Appeal Board, 20,456-49, the Court sustained a
ruling of this Board that workers laid off at the B. and G. I. Plants of the
F.M.D. due to lack of work arising out of a strike at the R.R. plant of that
company, were not subject to the suspension provision under Section 592.1 of
the Law The Court stated in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Unemployment
compensation statutes were enacted in various states during a period of
distress and were designed to relieve the hardship caused by unemployment due
to no fault of the employee. The legislative purpose behind the enactment of
our act is to be found in the legislative declaration of public policy in
Section 501. There, the legislature stated that in its considered judgment the
public good and the well being of the wage earner of this state, require the
enactment of this measure for the compulsory setting aside of financial
reserves for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.
This is a remedial statute, a humanitarian statute, and should be construed
accordingly. It is the general rule that a liberal construction is accorded
statutes which are regarded by courts as humanitarian, or which are grounded on
a humane public policy. In the two cases that we are considering the
unemployment was involuntary. These employees had nothing to do with the
stoppage of work in the D. plant. They were not consulted about the work
stoppage or with the prosecution of the strike and clearly they had nothing to
do with the settlement. They are the innocent victims of a situation wholly
beyond their control. The question which we have to decide is whether these
claimants lost their employment because of a strike in the establishment in
which they were employed within the meaning of section 592, subdivision 1 of
the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

believe the word &quot;establishment&quot; as used in the statute means the
place where the employee was last employed. Obviously, the legislature never
intended by the use of the word &quot;establishment&quot; to include all the
plants of the F.M. Co., situated as they are in so many states of the union and
in foreign countries. To adopt the appellant’s contention would require us to
hold that a few employees in any of the employer’s plants, in any part of this
country, can prevent the workers in the B. and G.I. plants from earning a
livelihood or, in lieu thereof, from getting the insignificant amount of
unemployment insurance that is available to them under the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the solution of the problem before us is to be found in determining from all
the facts available whether the B. and G. I. Plants under consideration are
separate establishments from the standpoint of employment and not whether they
are to be regarded as separate enterprises from the standpoint of management or
for the more efficient production of manufactured products. In construing the
statute before us we approach the subject from the standpoint of employment
rather than management and in so doing we have no hesitancy in concluding that
the findings of the Unemployment Board are amply sustained by the evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole question before the Board on this
appeal is whether or not claimant was totally unemployed during the entire
periods of her filing and whether or not she was overpaid in benefits. The
Commissioner contends that since claimant was paid on a monthly basis she must
be regarded as having been in continuous employment and that she was not
totally unemployed at any time during which she worked under that arrangement.
The referee ruled that claimant was totally unemployed except on the days when
she actually performed services for the society and that she was entitled to
retain the benefits which she received. We agree with the result reached by the
referee. We believe that the referee correctly ruled that the Appeal Board
decisions #20,783-48 and #21,515-59 upon which the Commissioner relies, are not
controlling. Those cases involved duly elected public officials whose duties
were of a continuous nature, not allocable to specific days and whose
obligation to hold themselves in readiness for calls for their services were
continuous. This cannot be said to be true of the claimant since her work could
be performed at her home and at such times as were convenient to her. Nor do we
believe that Appeal Board #17,625-48 is applicable herein. That case involved a
building superintendent where the very nature of his employment called for the
performance of services daily. No question has been raised on this appeal as to
the accuracy or truthfulness of claimant’s reports to the local office
respecting the days on which she performed services for the society. We believe
that the local office properly ruled that claimant was unavailable for
employment and not totally unemployed only with respect to those days when she
actually performed such duties and that it correctly authorized the payment of
checks to her for the remaining periods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A combined hearing was held at which
claimant’s attorney, his witness and representatives of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant Kasbohm, a marine
engineer, filed for benefits on June 22, 1949. By initial determination, he was
ruled ineligible effective August 18 through August 28, because he was not
totally unemployed, and was ruled overpaid $52 for the effective days August 18
through August 28. Claimant was a member of a marine union. Sometime at the
beginning of August, at a meeting of the membership, a special grievance
committee membership of seven members was elected. Included among the grievance
committee membership was claimant. At the time, the union had changed its
shipping rules and the special committee was elected to enforce such new rules.
It was their duty to check any violations and grievances, and to prepare cases
for presentation to the membership at large. They would draw charges to impeach
various members of the union. It was necessary in the furtherance of the
committee business to investigate various complaints. This would require the
members of the committee to travel to the various piers in the port of New
York; specifically to Brooklyn, Staten Island, Hoboken or Jersey City. A quorum
of four was necessary for the transaction of committee business. For the
periods in issue, claimant attended at the union hiring hall, where the
committee met five or six days per week, and Sundays and Holidays when
necessary. It specifically was provided that service on the committee would not
be a bar to employment of its various members, and any member who became
employed could immediately resign. The cards of the committee members were
automatically placed up for bid for jobs coming into the union hiring hall, and
if a committee member’s turn was reached, he would receive employment. One
member of the committee became so employed during the course of his service on
the committee. It was conceded by the Commissioner's representative that the
claimant could assume employment and that claimant was actually in the labor
market for work in his occupation. On September 7, 1949, at a general meeting
of the membership of the local, a payment of $6 per day, retroactive to August
18 the first day on which the committee commenced to function, was voted by the
membership. Such payment was for expenses which might be incurred by the
committee members, and was so indicated on the union books. The amount was
established by the usual six-day allowance which contract employers gave to
union members on travel status. Claimant received the payment of $6 per day
throughout the entire period in issue. As part of the duties of the committee
members, it was necessary to travel to various ships located at various piers.
In such travel, subways, ferries, buses, and taxis, when necessary, were used.
When on such assignment, the committee members would charge the union with
meals. Such meals came out of the $6 per day allowed for expenses. In addition,
when the committee members were required to remain late in order to hear
grievances against union members, they would eat their evening meals and pay
for the same out of the expenses they received. Rather than require the
submission of bills through the business agent of the union, the allowance of
$6 per day was voted. The general range of pay for marine engineers was from
$350 per month, for the lowest classification, to $850 per month for the
highest classification for a 48-hour work week. In addition, such individuals received
board and lodging aboard ship. Claimant concededly attended at the union hiring
hall at least five days per week, and from there was dispatched on various
committee matters. He was not subject to the supervision of any individual, but
was told what had to be done by the committee chairman. What was required to be
done was decided by the union membership when the rules were passed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The testimony was barren
to show that the services rendered by the committee members were under any
contract of employment for hire. As union members, and in order to further
their interests, the committee members were designated by the union at large to
enforce certain shipping rules. There was no intent to pay any remuneration for
such services; nor were these individuals subject to supervision, direction and
control. The assumption by a committee members of his duties in no way
interfered with his availability for employment, and, in fact, it was so
conceded by the Commissioner’s representative. The daily allowance voted to
each committee member in no manner approximated his usual salary, and was
selected because of the contract provisions in the collective bargaining
agreements of the union with contract employer, providing for $6 a day for
subsistence. It was true that expenses incurred did not approximate the amount
allowed. However, it was clear that such sums received were expenses, and were
so designated by the union. Accordingly, I find that the committee members were
not employees of the union or elected officials of the union, but rendered
services to the membership at large in the furtherance of the union interests
without the thought of receipt of remuneration for such services. I find
claimant totally unemployed. The initial determination is overruled. Claimant
was not overpaid. (September 26, 1950)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

representatives of the employer and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. Claimant, a saleslady, filed for benefits on July 28,
1950. By an initial determination she was disqualified for 42 days effective
July 28 for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. Claimant was
last employed on a full-time basis on October 1949. She remained unemployed
until May 1950, when she was placed in employment with a ladies’ apparel store
as a saleslady. The job called for two or three days’ work a week. Claimant
left this job voluntarily on July 22, 1950, because it was not a full-time job.
Claimant admits that her earnings on an hourly basis were above the usual
hourly rate in her area for her type of work. However, she claims that her
total weekly earnings were too low. Claimant usually worked about 20 hours a
week, and, with commissions, earned approximately $1 an hour. At the time
claimant left, she had no other job. At the time of the hearing she was still
unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rather than become unemployed she should have kept her part-time job until she
secured a full-time one. She could have used her days off for that purpose. In
the meantime she could have filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits,
so that she could be assisted financially. In abandoning her job, however, and
thus becoming totally unemployed, claimant acted unreasonably within the

two years and eight months until July 2, 1949 by the M. Hotel located in New
York City. Claimant’s duties consisted of firing the hotel furnace, carrying
out the ashes and general labor. On July 2, 1949 at about 8:00 a.m. claimant
had finished putting the cans out on the sidewalk when the chief engineer of
the hotel inquired as to why claimant had not swept the sidewalk. Claimant
replied that it was not part of his duties to sweep the sidewalk, as he had
never performed that task before. He was thereupon directed by the chief
engineer to sweep the sidewalk and claimant refused to do so. The chief
engineer then pulled claimant’s time card out of the rack and instructed the
hotel auditor to pay him off as of 10:00 a.m. the same day. Claimant was paid
off as of July 2, 1949 and in addition was paid for one week’s accrued
vacation. Claimant filed for benefits at the local office on July 6, 1949 and
stated that he had lost his job because of a layoff. An initial determination
was issued by the local office on August 7, 1940 disqualifying claimant for 42
consecutive days, effective July 6, 1949 on the ground that he voluntarily left
his employment without good cause and charging claimant with an overpayment of
$156. He was also held to have made a wilful misrepresentation in order to
obtain benefits and his benefit rights were suspended for 24 effective days.
The wilful misrepresentation was based on information received from the
employer to the effect that claimant had asked to be paid off. Claimant
protested the initial determinations and requested a hearing. The referee
sustained the initial determinations and the claimant appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We are in accord with the referee’s conclusion
that claimant provoked his discharge which was tantamount to a voluntary
leaving of employment without good cause. We are not in accord with the
referee’s conclusion to the effect that claimant was guilty of a wilful
misrepresentation in order to obtain benefits. We are aware of the opinion that
claimant was discharged by the employer after he refused to sweep the sidewalk.
The fact that the employer paid off the claimant on the day of separation from
employment and gave him one week’s vacation money is strong evidence to the
Board that the claimant did not quit his job. The record shows that claimant
had been admonished by his superior on numerous occasions for being lax in his
duties. The request of the employer was reasonable and was not out of line with
his normal duties. We find, however, that claimant provoked his discharge by
his refusal to follow his supervisor’s instructions. The claimant’s conduct is
tantamount to a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause within the
meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Claimant was discharged and was
sincere in his statement to the local office that he became unemployed because of
a lay-off. He believed &quot;laid off&quot; and &quot;discharged&quot; or
&quot;fired&quot; were synonymous terms, and it is logical to assume that any
lay person under similar circumstances would use the term laid off instead of
fired or discharged. We find no basis, therefore, to substantiate the holding
that claimant made a wilful misrepresentation in order to obtain benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at which the claimant, her
attorney, and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testimony was taken. Claimant, an executive secretary, refiled a claim for
benefits on January 16, 1950. By an amended initial determination she was
declared ineligible effective April 28, 1950, because of her failure to comply
with registration requirements. For about 18 years claimant had worked for a
magazine publisher in the City of New York. Her employment was terminated in May
1949, at which time she was receiving a weekly salary of $107 plus a bonus. She
has been without employment since May 1949. During the period here at issue
claimant resided at Stanfordville, and indicated that she was no longer
interest in employment in New York City but was interested in employment at
Poughkeepsie only. At the time of her registration for work claimant indicated
that her occupation was that of a secretary and she specified that she was
seeking work as a secretary. She indicated that she had a knowledge of typing
and shorthand but set forth the fact that she had not done stenographic work
for about ten years. Most secretaries employed in Poughkeepsie area are
required to do stenography and typing work. In order to determine claimant’s
skills as a typist or as a stenographer, an employment interviewer on April 28,
1950, requested that claimant submit to a test. Claimant suggested that she be
tested with respect to her stenographic ability at the rate of 120 words per
minute. The employment interviewer commenced to dictate to claimant at that
rate of speed, but claimant refused to proceed with the test, indicating that
she felt that she was not qualified to compete for a stenographer’s job with
recent high school graduates and that she could not pass the test. The
interviewer then suggested to the claimant that the rate of speed be reduced
and that claimant attempt to take shorthand at the rate of 96 words per minute
or at the rate of 80 words per minute, but, the claimant refused to continue with
the test under any circumstances. The interviewer then suggested to the
claimant that irrespective of her willingness to proceed with the stenography
test she should submit to the typing test, but the claimant refused to submit
to that test. Claimant did not thereafter submit to the test or reconsider her
position and she failed to submit to the tests during the balance of the time
for which she made claim for benefits through at least May 24, 1950. On the
last mentioned date an attempt was made to refer claimant to employment, but
she refused to accept referral, indicating that she was then withdrawing from
the labor market. She made no claim for benefits thereafter. Claimant
maintained that she was justified in refusing to submit to the tests because her
stenographic or typing abilities were not factors in her search for work. She
maintained that the type of work for which she was reasonably fitted by
training and experience did not require her to do any typing or stenographic
work and that consequently, she was justified in refusing to submit to tests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that claimant refused to continue with the stenography test that was required
by the employment office. It has been shown by credible evidence that in order
that claimant be exposed to suitable employment, it was necessary for the
Commissioner’s representatives to be in a position to properly appraise
claimant’s skills with regard to her ability to write shorthand. Claimant had
indicated when she filed her claim for benefits that she had that she was
seeking work as a secretary, an occupation in which shorthand ability was a
factor. Consequently, it may not be said that the employment office was
unreasonable in requiring claimant to submit to the test. By her failure to
submit to the tests claimant failed to properly register her claim as required
by Law. In an analagous case, the Court said,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

properly upheld the initial determination. Claimant had removed herself to an

skills which she had acquired in her most recent employment. The employment
office was charged with the duty of classifying claimant in an occupation
category in which opportunities for employment existed in the area. Claimant’s
refusal to submit to the tests under these circumstances was a proper basis for

1950. Thereafter, on June 19, 1950 claimant was referred to employment with a
cannery located at Clyde, New York as a laborer, in his customary occupation,
at the rate of 75¢ per hour. Claimant visited the prospective employer and
advised him that his last employer promised to recall him very shortly and that
if he were recalled, he would give up the new job, if hired. Because of this
statement made by claimant which he knew to be untrue, as no such promise had been
made to him by his last employer, the prospective employer did not hire
claimant. The local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant on the ground that he refused employment without good cause. Claimant
contested the initial determination which resulted in the decision of the

May 22, 1950 as a seaman on a merchant tanker which made trips to the Middle
and Far East. During his last trip, claimant spent $47 for dental and medical
treatment in Germany and Arabia. He also received medication from the purser on
the ship for a sprained shoulder. When the ship completed its voyage, he took
time off to receive medical and dental treatment. He did not request a relief
trip and a replacement was made by the employer. Thereafter, claimant received
dental treatment at Longview, Texas. On June 6, 1950, claimant filed a claim
for benefits in Port Arthur, Texas against New York as the liable State. From
June 8, 1950 to June 19, 1950, claimant received medical treatment as an
outpatient in Port Arthur, Texas. The employer reported that claimant
&quot;left vessel because of illness.&quot; The Out-of-State Resident Unit
issued an initial determination that claimant voluntarily left his employment
without good cause. The basis for the determination was that claimant did not
request a leave for medical attention. Claimant did not request a relief trip
because he was attached to a naval tanker operating out of the Persian Gulf on
trips from two to seven months’ duration. He stated that it would have been
impractical for him to do so since he would have had to wait two and one-half
to seven months for the next trip and by registering for work at once he had
prospects of obtaining a job within a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The record in this case establishes that
claimant left his job in order to obtain needed medical and dental care and
that he subsequently received treatments for a period of almost a month. The
referee sustained the initial determination of voluntary leaving without good
cause on the ground that claimant failed to request a relief trip. However,
there is nothing before us to show that by doing so claimant would have
protected himself in employment and we cannot accept the conclusion of the
referee. The initial determination is apparently based on the assumption that
by requesting a relief trip claimant would have placed himself in a position to
become immediately re-employed upon the completion of his medical treatments.
Claimant did not request a relief trip because the voyage would have lasted
from two to seven months and he expected to be able to return to work in about
a month. He believed that he had good prospects of obtaining work through the
union and it appears that his chances might have been jeopardized had he asked
for the relief trip. It does not follow that the mere failure to request a
relief trip constitutes a voluntary leaving of employment without good cause.
Under the circumstances herein and in the absence of any evidence that claimant
would have protected his employment by doing so, it must be held that claimant
left his job to received medical treatment and we do not believe that the
initial determination can stand. However, since claimant held himself available
for employment in the shipping industry, he was unavailable for employment
during the period he received out-patient care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was had at
which claimant, her witness, and a representative of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a laundry worker, filed for
benefits on June 28 and December 27, 1949. By an initial determination claimant
was disqualified for 42 days, effective June 28, because she voluntarily left
her employment without good cause and, further, it was ruled that the claimant
wilfully made false statements to obtain benefits on June 21, and 24 effective
days were declared forfeited. By a subsequent determination claimant was
disqualified for 42 days, effective December 27, because she voluntarily left
her employment without good cause. Claimant was employed to June 21, at which
time she left. It had been claimant’s custom not to work during July and
August. She could have continued in her employment as work was available. Upon
her application for benefits on June 28, she stated that she last worked on
June 21 and that she left or lost her employment because of &quot;not work.&quot;
The original claims form contains the following printed matter thereon:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;Your last employer

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>At the hearing claimant
was requested to read the printed portion of the application form. However, she
could not read English to the extent that she could properly read the printed
matter. The claimant completed the fifth grade in primary school. Claimant
returned to work for the employer after Labor Day on a part-time basis. She
discontinued her employment on December 19. Claimant asserted that she left
this employment because she was ill. On said date, when claimant’s husband
returned from his work he found her ill in bed. A doctor was summoned and the
doctor reported to claimant’s husband that claimant was in a run-down
condition. Furthermore, claimant asserted that she asked her &quot;boss&quot;
for a raise and that the &quot;boss&quot; made a vulgar retort accompanied by a
vulgar gesture and the conduct of her &quot;boss&quot; extremely upset her and
caused her to become ill. Claimant’s husband was apprised of this situation and
visited the employer’s establishment to investigate the remarks allegedly made
to the claimant. At that time one of the owners of the business told claimant’s
husband that the person making the remarks to claimant had been warned on a
number of occasions against similar unwarranted conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Upon the evidence
adduced I find that claimant voluntarily left her employment on June 21 without
good cause. By claimant’s admission, work was available for her at that time,
but she voluntarily left because of her desire not to work in the months of
July and August. I further find that claimant did not wilfully make false
statements to obtain benefits on June 21. While it is true that claimant did
state on the application form that the loss of her employment was due to lack
of work, it is my opinion that the statement was made by her without any intent
on her part to wilfully misrepresent the facts. There is no contention that
claimant was interrogated at that time as to the reason for the termination of
her employment. It is obvious that claimant did not possess a sufficient
knowledge of the English language to read and comprehend the printed portion of
the claim form. Accordingly, the charge of wilful misrepresentation is
overruled and the forfeiture of 24 effective days is cancelled. I further find
that claimant voluntarily left her employment on December 19 with good cause.
The remark made to claimant by her supervisor, with the accompanying gesture,
would in my opinion justify her refusal to continue to work under such
conditions. Accordingly, the initial determination effective December 27 is
overruled. The initial determination of voluntary leaving effective June 28 is
sustained and all other determinations are overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Opinion and Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This is an appeal by
the Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance
Appeal Board, which affirmed a decision of an unemployment insurance referee,
overruling an initial determination by the Industrial Commissioner. Claimant
had been employed as a laundry worker for about twelve years prior to June
1949. On June 21 of that year she left her employment of her own volition. Work
was available for her but it was her custom not to work during the months of
July and August. She filed a claim for benefits on June 28, 1949, and in that
application she stated that she lost her employment because of &quot;no
work&quot;. The Industrial Commissioner disqualified her for benefits for
forty-two days effective June 28, 1949, because she voluntarily left her
employment without good cause and because of the false statement in her application,
that her employment was terminated because of &quot;no work&quot;. The issue
presented in this case is whether the forfeiture of benefit rights imposed by
the Industrial Commissioner under Section 594 of the Unemployment Insurance Law
is justified because of the false statement made by claimant as to the reason
for her separation from employment. The referee and the Appeal Board excused
the misrepresentation on the theory that claimant was not sufficiently apprised
of the consequences of the false statement which she made. The referee and the
Appeal Board sustained the determination of the Commissioner that claimant
voluntarily left her employment without good cause and overruled the
determination imposing the forfeiture. The referee and the Board erred as a matter
of law in holding the claimant was not subject to the forfeiture. Decision
appealed from is reversed on the law, without costs, and the initial
determination of the Industrial Commissioner reinstated. (June 29,1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by employers in the Gloversville area who operated plants in connection with
the processing of skins used in the manufacture of gloves and leather goods. In
1945, several of the tannery firms in that locality organized an employers’
association which was incorporated under the Membership Corporation Law. The
employers for whom claimants worked were members of this association. For some
time prior to June 30, 1949, each of the employers, through the association,
was in contractual relations with the local of the furriers’ union of which
most of the claimants were members. A collective bargaining agreement between
the association representing the employers and the union were executed on June
19,1947. Under the terms of the agreement, it was to continue in effect until
June 30, 1949 except as to wages, hours and other financial matters. With
respect to the aforementioned matters, the agreement provided that it was to
terminate on December 31, 1948, that the parties were to notify each other on
or before October 1,1948 concerning the nature of any proposal relating to
financial matters desired to become effective on and after January 1, 1949 and
that the parties were to strive to come to an agreement thereon before December
31, 1948. The union made new demands on the employers concerning higher wages
and working conditions shortly prior to October 1, 1948. The employers resisted
these demands. A proposed contract concerning such matters was discussed
between the parties at various times commencing October 1948 but no agreement
was reached. In the meantime the employees continued to work under the wage
terms of the 1947 contract. The situation became very tense with the approach
of the expiration date of the contract on June 30, 1949 and the annual vacation
period for the workers in the industry which was usually fixed the first two
weeks in July. During the latter part of June 1949, notices were posted on the
bulletin boards of the various plants, of which the following were typical:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

referee’s decision holding that the employees who worked for the employer, I.L.
Corporation, became unemployed as a result of an industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed. This appeal is taken from the latter
part of the referee’s decision. The referee reasoned that these claimants,
having been laid off on July 1, 1949 with no definite date of return to work,
were not in an employment relationship with the employer and were totally
unemployed on July 16, 1949 when the industrial controversy came into being;
and that therefore their unemployment was not attributable to the labor
controversy. He added further that, even if the evidence justified the
conclusion that the claimants would have been re-employed within a few weeks
after the vacation period but for the industrial controversy, the same result
would follow because of the absence of the employment relationship. The
Industrial Commissioner contends that the vacation lay-offs did not interrupt
the employer-employee relationship of the workers involved and that their
subsequent unemployment was directly due to the industrial controversy. We
believe that the Commissioner must prevail. There is no substantial
disagreement that except for the intervening dispute the claimants would have
all returned to work in normal course with their respective employers at the
end of the vacation period. On the facts set forth herein we find no basis for
the holding that the claimants had no definite date of return to work or that
the vacation lay-offs interrupted the employer-employee relationship between
them and the employers. Under these circumstances the consequent unemployment
of the claimants was directly due to the industrial controversy. (<u>Matter of
Sadowski</u>, 257 app. Div. 529, affirming Appeal Board, 229-38). Claimants
were properly disqualified pursuant to Section 592.1 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

25 years’ experience, refiled for benefits on October 2, 1950. In her prior
employment with a skirt contractor, she earned between $1.50 and $2 an hour on
a piecework basis. On October 4, 1950, during a slack season, as a result of
her own effort, she obtained employment on a piecework basis, pursuant to the
union scale of wage, with another skirt contractor. She worked from 11:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. on that day and earned about $4.25. Claimant failed to report to
work thereafter as she believed that she would not earn as much as she had in
her previous employment. The said employer had in its employ, in addition to
claimant, 11 other operators who averaged between $40 and $60 per week. The
employer stated that within a few days claimant would have earned as much as
the other operators. On October 11, claimant refiled for benefits. The local
office thereafter issued an initial determination holding that claimant left
her employment without good cause. Claimant contested the initial
determination, which resulted in the decision of the referee overruling the
same. From this decision the Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which claimant and
representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant
filed for benefits on June 5, 1950. She received seven benefit checks until
August 16, 1950, when she was disqualified for refusal of employment without
good cause by an initial determination. In the prior benefit year, claimant had
received 23 benefit checks, having become unemployed in December 1949. Another
initial determination was issued that claimant was unavailable for employment
from August 18 to August 27, 1950, during which time she was visiting in
Liberty, New York. Claimant failed to report to the insurance office as
required on August 21 because she was out of town. Prior to 1950, claimant was
a housewife. Since that time she has been working in a union dress
establishment. For the first two or three years of her employment she was a
sewing machine operator and a member of the union. Thereafter, she was promoted
to forelady and was not required to continue her membership in the union. In
December 1949, claimant was laid off because the employer decided he would be
his own foreman. Claimant has been totally unemployed since last December. On
August 15, 1950, she was offered employment with a union shop as an operator.
She accepted the referral but failed to report to the employer. Claimant did
not wish to accept the job because it was a union shop. She claims that her
first preference is for a forelady’s job, but that she would accept employment
as an operator providing she did not have to join a union. According to the
employment office, there are many opportunities for sewing machine operators
but very few opportunities for positions as forelady. According to the
Commissioner’s representatives, foreladies are usually promoted from operators.
Most of the dressmaking establishments in claimant’s area are unionized. The
initial determination of refusal and unavailability was issued August 26, 1950.
The Commissioner’s representative makes a preliminary objection that claimant
is not entitled to a hearing on the merits because the request for a hearing
was not timely. Claimant states that she continued to report during this entire
period every Monday and that the week after she was disqualified she orally
requested a hearing. She claims she was not asked to sign a written request for
a hearing until September 18.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: On the question of the
timeliness in requesting a hearing, I am inclined to give claimant the benefit
of the doubt. The fact that she reported every week after she was disqualified
is an indication of her disagreement with the initial determination and it may
very well be that claimant asked for a hearing promptly but was not requested
to sign a written request until 23 days after the initial determination was
issued. On the merits of the case, however, I am convinced that the insurance
office made the correct ruling in this case. Claimant appears to have acted
unreasonably in failing to report to the employer in question. She has been
totally unemployed for almost a year. It should be evident to her that it is
extremely difficult to obtain a forelady's job. Claimant seems to have recognized
this difficulty by her willingness to accept a sewing machine operator's job,
in which occupation she has considerable experience. Her reason for limiting
herself however to non-union establishments seems strange. Since most factories
in claimant’s area are unionized, this restriction interfered substantially
with her possibilities of securing work. She was formerly a member of the
union. In a union shop her earnings would normally be higher than in a
non-union one. It is therefore concluded that claimant lacked good cause for
her refusal. In view of this decision it becomes unnecessary to decide the
availability issue. The initial determination of refusal is sustained.

bar and restaurant in Saratoga Springs, New York, from November 1948 to
September 23, 1950, receiving $24 per week, plus tips, when the business place
was closed. She filed an original claim for benefits and registered for
employment on September 28, 1950. She was referred to employment as a waitress
on October 3, 1950 in a hotel dining room on the State Reservation Park, a
wooded area, situated several miles from the village limits. The employment was
on a split shift basis, from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., 12 noon to 2:00 p.m., 6:00
p.m. to 8:00 p.m., six days per week, and paid $15 per week, plus tips and room
and board. Claimant refused the referral because she had never worked the split
shift and because she did not want to leave her home to live at the hotel. The
local office issued an initial determination disqualifying her from benefits
for refusal of employment, without good cause, effective October 3, 1950.
Claimant protested and requested a hearing. Claimant has lived for forty-four
years in a house several miles from Saratoga Springs in the opposite direction
from the location of the offered employment. She lives with her brother and
sister and owns her home jointly with the brother. Travel time from claimant’s
home to the hotel is approximately one hour and would necessitate riding a bus
to the center of the village and then transferring to another bus going to the
hotel. Claimant has worked steadily as a waitress in Saratoga Springs and
vicinity for more than 25 years, during all of which time she has had
employment at only five or six different jobs. With only one exception which
was early in her work history, claimant always worked one shift of seven to
eight hours in night clubs, restaurants and in ordinary eating places. Her last
employment was from 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. She obtained work on October 14,
1950, in a restaurant outside of the village and was given one and two nights
work per week. Commencing November 11, 1950, she was employed at a nightclub
for three nights a week, which later was reduced to one night a week. In
February 1951, and again on April 20, 1951, she obtained full-time employment
as a waitress in restaurants in Saratoga Springs. It is the customary practice
in waitress service at the establishment to which claimant was referred to give
complete service to guests who come in a few minutes before closing. Therefore,
the employment would frequently require claimant to work as late as 9:00 p.m.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee sustained the initial
determination on the premise that the wages and working conditions of the
employment were not substantially less favorable to the claimant than those
prevailing for similar work in the area and that it was suitable employment. We
do not agree with this conclusion. Claimant has been a permanent resident of the
Saratoga Springs area and for 25 years has enjoyed steady employment, winter
and summer, on a one shift basis of seven or eight hours. She had always lived
with relatives in her own home. Within two months after her last employment she
secured steady employment of three nights a week working one shift each night
and she has worked more or less regularly since. We are of the opinion that the
employment offered claimant on October 3, 1950, would have caused her undue
hardship in that it required either that she live at the hotel and relinquish
her home life, or that she be subjected to an unreasonable amount of travel and
expense. The only way claimant could avoid the six trips daily to and from work
would be for her to remain at the hotel all day which would require that she

the contentions advanced by the Commissioner’s representatives were to have validity,
the Law would in effect be re written so as to exclude from the benefits
provided thereby all of those residents of the various communities in the State
in which industry suffers a seasonal slackening. The Law, as it now reads,
contains no language which would authorize the denial of benefits to those
people who reside in a rural area and who are genuinely attached to such labor
market as exists in those areas, merely because circumstances over which those
persons have no control takes from them the opportunity of employment during
certain seasons of the year. The unemployment suffered by such persons, even
though it may recur in particular seasons of the year, brings about that
economic insecurity which the Legislature found to be a serious menace to the
health, welfare and morals of the people of this State and which, in accord
with the public policy of the State, motivated the enactment of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. (Section 501). The unemployment of the claimant is
entirely involuntary and stems from the unavailability of work for him rather
than his unavailability for work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

find no warrant in the Law authorizing an interpretation of the statute in such
manner as to bring about the exclusion of seasonal workers from the provisions
thereof. In this connection, it is significant when the Unemployment Insurance
Law was originally enacted, the Legislature gave consideration to the fact that
in certain industries, occupations and in certain localities of the State there
would be recurrent seasonal layoffs and it was calculated in the original
enactment of the Law, that as a result of hearings to be conducted by the
Industrial Commissioner and findings made by him, seasonal workers would
receive benefits only during periods of unemployment which occurred during the
course of the normal season of employment. (Section 596 formerly Section 508).
However, subsequently, the Legislature repealed the section of the Law dealing
with seasonal employees. (Chapter 663, Laws of 1946.) Surely, it cannot be
argued that by the repeal of the statute the Legislature intended to delegate
to the Industrial Commission the authority to interpret the Law in a manner
which would legislature (sic) seasonal workers out of benefits. A further
indication of the legislative policy in the premises is to be found in the
enactment by the Legislature in 1944 of a section of the law declaring that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

community in every period of the year. Since the credible evidence indicates
that he is in fact so prepared to accept suitable work and there is no evidence

benefits indulge in futile gestures to indicate and alleged search for work
where it affirmatively appears that the conditions of the labor market are well
known to the residents of the community. The rule enunciated in Appeal Board
24,512-50, is applicable:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

who furnish steady employment to their employees, under the provisions of the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant a soda clerk, filed for benefits on November 6, 1950. By an
initial determination she was declared ineligible because of unavailability
effective November 6, 1950. For many years claimant has resided in Ticonderoga.
Ticonderoga has a population of approximately 3400. The paper mill engaged in
business in that area operates on a year round basis, ordinarily employing
about 700 persons, but due to a recent reduction in staff, about 140 persons
were laid off. All other industries at Ticonderoga are of a seasonal nature,
serving directly or indirectly the resort industries. The historical museum at
Fort Ticonderoga employs about 60 persons during the summer months and retains
a staff of about three maintenance employees on a year round basis. A bank
operates on a year round basis, and there are eight restaurants and eating
places, two drug store, and about 20 retail establishments, all of which
operate throughout the year. However, due to slackening of conditions at the
close of the summer period, all the aforesaid establishments operate on a
reduced scale during the balance of the year, and employ a substantially lesser
number of persons during all months of the year except those between about May
and October. In addition to the foregoing, a textile mill, which had previously
abandoned its plant at Ticonderoga, re-established the plant in the latter part
of 1950, and articles which appeared in the newspaper indicated that the
operators of the plant expected to hire many women for work in the plant. For
two years during the war period claimant worked as a paper handler in the paper
mills. However, that employment terminated at the conclusion of the war. Except
for such work at the paper mill, claimant has worked for 14 seasons at the
historical museum. Her employment there extends annually during the period when
the museum is open to the public, from about May until November. She receives a
weekly salary of $30. In the winter of 1938 and 1939 claimant, together with
her husband, worked at a school in Albany at which they lived during the period
of their employment. Aside from the foregoing, claimant has had no other
employment. At no time has claimant had any off-season employment at
Ticonderoga. Although she professes a willingness to accept work away from
Ticonderoga on a live-in basis, claimant at no time made any effort whatever to
inquire about such work opportunities, and at the hearing she modified her
statement with respect to her willingness to work away from home, by indicating
that she would accept live-in work only if it were within a radius of 20 miles
from her home. Claimant made no effort at any time since the war to obtain work
at the paper mill, for the reason that she believed that she is too old to be
hired there. She made no effort to obtain work at the textile mill when it
reopened in the latter part of 1950, because she claims that her eyesight is
not good enough for work in that establishment. Claimant maintains that
annually, during the off season, she sought work by speaking with the
proprietors of the various retail establishments employing sales clerks. At no
time has claimant sought any work in the various eating establishments in
Ticonderoga, despite her alleged willingness to accept work as a waitress or
kitchen helper. Likewise, claimant failed to inquire about work opportunities
at the one establishment in Ticonderoga which has the most active soda bar in
that community during the off season. Claimant maintains that she prefers to
work on an all year round basis rather than on a seasonal basis. She indicated
that she realized that if she applied prior to the commencement of the summer
season for work at the various establishments which operate on a year round
basis at Ticonderoga, her chances of getting such work would be better. Yet
even though claimant alleges willingness to relinquish her seasonal employment
for all year round work, she could offer no reason for her failure to, at any
time, make application for work during the spring months at the establishments
which operate on a year round basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: While claimant’s more
or less consistent pattern of work during only a seasonal period does not
conclusively indicate her unavailability for work during other periods of the
year, nevertheless it is a factor which must be given consideration, together
with all the other facts and circumstances which shed light on claimant’s
genuine readiness and willingness to work during the period for which she had
made claim for benefits. That which tends to shed most light on claimant’s
status is her conduct with respect to the attempt to procure off-season work.
An analysis of the credible evidence herein points inescapably to the
conclusion that claimant had no real desire to obtain any employment during the
off seasons and that her unemployment during off seasons is not attributable
entirely to the conditions existing in the area in which she resides, but stems
to a degree at least from the fact that claimant refers to work on only the
seasonal basis. This conclusion is evident from the fact that claimant failed
to make application for work in those particular establishments where the
likelihood is that opportunities for work would better than in those
establishments to which she allegedly applied for work. Since claimant’s most
recent work was at a soda fountain, it surely should have occurred to her that
the place to which she should apply for work is that soda bar which is most
active during the winter months. Her failure to apply for work permits of no
inference other than that the claimant made merely token efforts in an attempt
to fortify her claim for benefits, rather than to procure work. Similarly, if
claimant’s assertion that she preferred work on an all year round basis were
credible, then there would be no reason by claimant should have avoided seeking
all year round work during the spring months or during the times when, because
of activities in the various establishments which operate on an all year round
basis, claimant’s opportunities for procuring work in such establishments would
be better. I therefore hold that claimant has failed to establish her
availability for work as contemplated by the provisions of the Law. The initial
determination is sustained. (April 25, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This does not necessarily mean, however, that unavailability will result in all
cases under similar circumstances. For instance, there may be cases where a
seasonal worker’s failure to make independent efforts to seek work is due to
the fact that an individual lives in a small compact community where no
suitable job opportunities exist and when claimant, because of familiarities

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which claimant and
representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified.
Claimant, a floor girl in the dress industry, filed a claim for benefits
effective February 26, 1951. By an initial determination she was declared
ineligible because of unavailability effective April 30, 1951. Until about
three years ago, claimant resided in the City of New York. She worked in a
clerical capacity for various firms in that city. Claimant is a typist, but she
has no other clerical skills. When she moved her residence from New York City
to Cairo about three years ago, claimant entered the labor market at Cairo and
accepted employment as a floor girl in the dress factory in that village. She
commenced to work in that establishment at a salary of $22 weekly and
ultimately received increases so that her terminal wage rate was 75 centers an
hour. Claimant continued to the employ of the dress firm in Cairo until the
latter part of February 1951, when she was temporarily laid off due to slack
conditions. She was advised by her employer that she would be recalled when
work would again become available. Throughout the period between the latter
part of February and about July 23, the plant at which claimant had been
employed was operated on a reduced scale. When the plan was operated at normal
production, the employer was able to employ floor girls, but during the period
when the plant was operated on a reduced scale, there was no need for service
of a floor girl, except during rare intermittent periods. In the period during
which claimant claimed benefits, other persons residing in Cairo, who are
regularly employed in the dress factory, underwent periods of unemployment and
were unable to procure other work. Cairo is a small community in Greene County
offering limited employment opportunities. Until July 23, there were no
establishments other than that at which the claimant had been employed which
utilized the services of floor girls. There are no other factories at Cairo.
Altogether, approximately six persons are employed in the Village of Cairo in a
clerical capacity. In most instances, clerical employees employed at Cairo are
required to have clerical skills in addition to ability as a typist. The usual
wage paid to clerical employees at Cairo are $25 for a 37½ hour work week.
There are no public transportation facilities which would enable a resident of
Cairo to commute to any other community for employment. Claimant has no private
means of transportation. She has no knowledge of any resident of Cairo with
whom she might ride to any community away from Cairo. In view of the period of
her resident in Cairo, claimant has become familiar with the various
enterprises engaged in business in that community and she was aware of the fact
that there were virtually no job opportunities during the period here in issue.
She believed that it would be futile for her to make any active search for work
in the Village of Cairo because she knew that the few establishments which
employed clerical employees were sufficiently staffed and that there were no
other factories which could utilize her skills. She advised the employment
office that she was prepared to accept clerical work or work as a floor girl.
She indicated that she expected a minimum wage of 75 cents an hour. However,
the statement with respect to her wage demands was made by the claimant with
regard to her return to work as a floor girl. She was actually prepared to
accept work in a clerical capacity at Greenville at a salary of $25 weekly. Due
to the fact that the operator of the dress factory continued to operate on a
reduced scale. Claimant received no call to return to work. She was interviewed
at the insurance office, and when she indicated that she was not actively
engaged in a job search, she was advised that that would be construed as an
indication of her unavailability for employment. When claimant received such
advice, she went to the various establishments engaged in business at Cairo and
inquired about the prospect of procuring work in either a clerical or sales
capacity, but she was advised that there were no job opportunities. Finally, on
June 6, 1951, the operator of the dress factory recalled claimant to work. She
reported immediately and continued to work in the establishment until June 18
when she was again laid off due to slack conditions. Upon the refiling of her
claim on June 18, her claim was reinstated. Thereafter, and on July 17,
claimant commenced to work in a clerical capacity at the office of a real
estate broker at Cairo. The operator of the agency knew claimant over a period
of time and her offered to train claimant to perform the clerical duties
necessary to be performed in his office. Claimant accepted the employment at a
weekly wage of $25 and until the day of the hearing she has been so employed.
Another dress factory was established in Cairo and commenced to operate on July
23. About two weeks prior to the opening of that establishment, claimant
learned of the fact that it would be established and she immediately filed an application
for employment in that establishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is undisputed that
ever since claimant has been a resident of Cairo she has had firm attachment to
the labor market in that community and that despite her lack of transportation
facilities to enable her to commute to any village away from Cairo, she,
nevertheless, had been able to remain in the labor market. Her unemployment
during the period here in issue was entirely involuntary and came about due to
circumstances over which she had no control, due principally, to the slack
business conditions which caused a lay off. Claimant’s availability for
employment must be determined in the light of those circumstances as well as in
the light of all of the conditions prevailing in the community in which
claimant resides. In support of the initial determination the Commissioner’s
representative stressed the fact that claimant did not make a diligent search
for work and that she indicated a demand for a minimum wage of 75 cents an
hour, which was deemed to be in excess of the wages which she would expect to
receive in Cairo. I am unable to attach the significance to those statements
that the Commissioner’s representatives contends should be attached thereto. It
would indeed be a harsh rule which would deny to a claimant benefits solely
because a statement made by the claimant taken apart from actual physical
conditions tend to create the impression that claimant is creating barriers to
possible employment. In the instant case, the record indicates conclusively
that the area in which claimant resided and to which she was restricted to
employment, normally offered some employment opportunities, but because of the
temporary cessation of activities in the dress factory, claimant was deprived of
al reasonable opportunities for employment for the period for which she claimed
benefits. Her demand for a wage of 75 cents an hour was certainly not
unreasonable in view of the fact that those were the wages which she received
and the minimum wage which would be paid to her if she were engaged in any
interstate work. Likewise, I am satisfied that despite any ambiguity which may
have been created by the language contained in the written statements signed by
the claimant, she was, in fact, prepared to accept work at $25 per week in a
clerical capacity at Cairo. The signed statements of the claimant in no ways
tended to lessen her prospects for employment. Clearly, irrespective of any
wage demands of the claimant, her prospects for obtaining clerical work at Cairo
were remote. That condition was caused not by any act on the part of the
claimant or any restrictions imposed by her, but solely because of the nature
of conditions which existed at Cairo. Since there were only six jobs in a
clerical capacity altogether at Cairo and there were no job vacancies, it was
unlikely that the claimant could have obtained such work, irrespective of any
statements by her with respect to her salary demands. That claimant as actually
prepared to accept work at all times is evidence by the fact that she accepted
employment as soon as she was recalled by her former employer, and that when
the first opportunity for employment in a clerical capacity arose, claimant
accepted it despite the fact that the wages offered were only $25 weekly.
Claimant’s failure to make a job search, at least until the time that the
insurance office indicated that her failure to make such search, might evince
her unavailability for work, is of no consequence, under the conditions which
existed (Appeal Board, 16,530-47). The independent efforts made by a claimant
to seek employment are factors which shed light on claimant’s availability for
work only in instances where it is reasonable to expect that a job search might
prove fruitful. However, when the claimant lives in a compact community, such
as the one here in issue, and by force of circumstances is familiar with the
fact that a job search would be of no avail because there are no suitable job
opportunities in the area, the Law does not expect that she will do a futile
act and engage in a search for work merely as a gesture to satisfy an alleged
requirement of the Law. (Appeal Board, 21,383-49; Nelson v. Review Board of
Indiana Security Division, et al. 82 NE (2d) 523.) I am satisfied that
claimant’s unemployment was not protracted one iota because of her failure to
make any personal canvass for work prior to the time that she was advised to do
so by the Commissioner’s representatives. Based upon my observation of the
claimant and my analysis of the evidence that has here been presented, I am
satisfied that claimant has met the availability requirements of the Law
throughout the period for which she claimed benefits. The initial determination
is overruled. (August 14, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

availability in the form of willingness to work is a very difficult task. It
means a probing into claimant’s state of mind. There is often doubt regarding
claimant’s true intentions which makes it improper to rely solely on his
self-serving declarations. This includes, but is not confined to, cases of
female claimants before and after childbirth; older workers, especially those
voluntarily or compulsorily retired from a former job; claimants who had
withdrawn from the labor market; claimants who had quit a job, particularly
when the quit was without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

require such claimants as a rule to make an independent search for work. That
is the course of action which a reasonably prudent person desirous of
employment would take. It is almost axiomatic that in many instances, and
particularly when the claimant has a handicap, be it because of age or for any
other reason, the independent search and the resulting personal contacts
represent the most promising manner for finding employment. When a claimant
fails to pursue such course of action, such failure creates serious doubts
regarding his true intention and often justifies the conclusion that he does
not comply with the requirement of availability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>There are not many
objective criteria to test an entirely subjective element, such as claimant’s
state of mind. Full resort to all available ascertainable and tangible criteria
is needed in order that proper determinations be made. It would not be
satisfactory if the way of lease resistance were taken and if claimant’s
statements were accepted as the ultimate truth because of the difficulties
inherent in the fact finding process otherwise. It would also not be
satisfactory to forego the application of the objective tests, such as search
for work, because the opportunities and the chances of finding employment in
this manner are limited. Even though it is obvious, for instance, that not all
older and retired workers in a given community will find employment by
independent efforts, it is by no means certain that a given individual claimant
may not be successful. Besides the question of actual success and its
probabilities in an individual case,&nbsp;<u>the search for work requirement is
in many instances the only test which will tend to support or engage claimant’s
allegation regarding his desire to work</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attorneys, a witness for claimant’s former employer and a representative of the
Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a machinist,
filed for benefits on June 28, 1949. He received 11 payments of $26 each
through September 22; he refiled on November 28, and received 14 payments
through March 5, 1950; he refiled on April 17, and received one payment through
April 23. An initial determination was issued declaring claimant ineligible by
reason of lack of total unemployment resulting from a back pay award for the
period June 28, 1949, to September 22, 1949, inclusive, and declaring him
overpaid $312 in benefits in consequence. A further initial determination was
issued declaring claimant ineligible from April 24, 1950, to May 21, 1950,
inclusive, for failure to comply with reporting requirements. Claimant was
discharged by the machine company for which he was working on June 24, 1949,
for refusing to operate a certain buffing machine. He was a member of a union
which was in contractual relations with the employer. Upon his dismissal, he
protested his discharge, claiming it was unjustified, and invoked the grievance
procedure established under the union contract for the amicable disposition of
such issues. The union’s attorneys represented the claimant in the arbitration
proceeding. A hearing was held before the arbitrators late in August or early
in September 1949 and an award was rendered under date of October 18, 1949
finding both the employer and the claimant to be somewhat at fault, and
ordering claimant to be reinstated with back pay equal to one-half of the
amount he would have received from the time of his discharge to the subsequent
date of offer of reinstatement, loss one-half of his actual earnings during the
period from any employment he might have had. The employer moved to set aside
the award and it was set aside on the ground that it did not comply with the
terms of the submission. The arbitration proceeding then commenced anew, and a
hearing was again held on February 16, 1950. An award was rendered under date
of February 28, 1950, in favor of the claimant. It stated, in substance, that
claimant had been discharged without just cause; that he was entitled to be
compensated for all time lost by reason for such unjustifiable discharge; that
the wages lost by him and resulting from the discharge amounted to $708.16,
which was awarded to him; and that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Said award was not
transmitted to claimant’s attorneys until March 17, 1950, and by letter dated
March 21, 1950, the business agent of claimant’s union local was sent a copy of
the award. A motion to set aside the award was made by the employer, returnable
April 13, was adjourned to April 19, but was denied, and the award was
confirmed on May 18, 1950. Under date of May 22, claimant’s union attorneys
wrote to the Division of Placement and Unemployment Insurance advising the
Division of the back pay award and of the other facts in connection with
claimant’s receipt of unemployment insurance benefits which created the issues
herein. Those facts, other than as stated above, were that claimant had signed
for his twenty-sixth benefit payment in the 1949-1950 benefit year for the week
ending April 23, 1950, thereby apparently exhausting his benefits in that
benefit year. When he signed for that check, the insurance office told him not
to report during the remainder of the benefit year since he would not be
entitled to receive any more payments. The effect of the back pay award was to
render claimant ineligible during the period covered by the award, and for
which he received unemployment insurance benefits, making it incumbent upon him
to return these benefits; and the consequence of that was that claimant did not
exhaust his benefits on April 23,1950, but was eligible for benefits during the
remainder of the 1949-1950 benefit year while totally unemployed. Claimant
contended, therefore, that under the circumstances he should have been excused
for not reporting after April 23, 1950, and should be declared eligible for
benefits from April 24 to May 21, 1950, inclusive, having first obtained
employment after April 23 on May 22. When claimant was told not to report to
the insurance office after April 23, he did not inform the insurance office of
the arbitrator’s award which had been rendered in his favor. On February 16,
1950 when he was due to report to the insurance office he telephoned the office
stating that he had been subpoenaed to appear at an arbitration hearing that
morning and would therefore be delayed. The records of the insurance office did
not indicate that claimant at that time told the insurance office his appearance
was in connection wit his pending proceeding for a back pay award. Claimant
testified that when he went to the insurance office after the telephone call he
presented the subpoena. The title of the arbitration proceeding was not in the
name of the claimant, but in the name of his union against the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: I do not believe that
the insurance office, when it informed claimant at the time he signed for his
twenty-sixth benefit payment that he need not report thereafter in the
1949-1950 benefit year because he had exhausted his current benefit rights, had
any information concerning claimant’s arbitration proceeding for back pay,
which made it incumbent under the insurance office to amplify or qualify that
statement to any degree. Under the circumstances, its instructions that
claimant was not to continue to report were correctly given. I believe that
during the last week in April claimant knew of the award in his favor. A
reasonable standard of conduct required him to inform the insurance office of
what had occurred, particularly since the award expressly provided for the
return of unemployment insurance benefits. The fact that claimant may not have
been certain he would receive the money under that award, as was suggested at the
final hearing herein, because the previous award had been set aside at the
behest of the employer, did not justify claimant in neglecting or refraining
from telling the insurance office of the facts as he knew them, together with
any misgivings he may have had as to eventual receipt of the money. Had he done
so, it is quite likely that he would have been advised to continue to report
while unemployed in order to protect his rights. Certainly, on this record it
may not be held that the insurance office was remiss in its instructions to
claimant or misled him to his detriment in the light of the facts then known to
it. Under the circumstances, the insurance office was not required to excuse
claimant’s failure to report from April 24 to May 21, 1950, inclusive, or to
rule him eligible for benefits during that period. The initial determinations
are sustained. (February 27, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is married and resides in the
Bellerose section of Queens County. For five years ending January 1950,
claimant was employed by a department store, located near the Pennsylvania
Terminal in the Borough of Manhattan, as a billing machine operator. At the
time of the termination of her employment she was being paid $46 per week.
Claimant voluntarily left her employment in order to be a housewife and to have
a baby. At the time claimant left her employment, she had no intention of
returning to work after the birth of her child. Claimant’s child was born in
June 1950. On August 28, 1950 claimant filed an application for benefits
alleging a return to the labor market. She restricted her employment to the
immediate vicinity of her residence where no employment opportunities existed.
Although she professed a willingness to accept employment in the Jamaica area,
she made no attempts to look for employment in that locality prior to September
26,1 950. She insisted on a minimum salary of $46 per week, the amount she
earned in her last employment. Claimant made little effort during this period
to look for work. On September 19, 1950, based on an interview with the
claimant, the local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from benefits on the ground that she withdrew from the labor market
and was unavailable for employment effective the date of her filing on August
28,1950. Claimant contested the initial determination and requested a hearing.
On September 5, 1950 claimant was referred by the employment service to
employment as a billing machine operator with an employer located in the Borough
of Manhattan, City of New York. The remuneration offered was $45 per week for a
five-day week. Claimant refused the employment solely on the ground that the
employment was located in Manhattan. Based upon a report from the Employment
Service and an interview with the claimant, the local office issued an
additional initial determination on September 20, 1950, disqualifying claimant
from benefits on the ground that, without good cause, she refused employment
for which she is reasonably fitted by training and experience. Claimant
contested this additional initial determination and requested a hearing. Both
issues were heard by the same referee who sustained both initial
determinations. Claimant thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

disqualifying claimant from benefits for refusing a job offer during the period

the language of the above provision which we underscored authorizes the

disqualification for withdrawal from the labor market. Subdivisions (a), (b),
(c) and (d) of Section 593.2 of the Law provide that claimants who refuse
employment under the conditions therein specified may not be denied benefits.
The last portion of the provision 593.2 (d) was inserted for the purpose of
insuring that claimants who are disqualified for withdrawal may not use the
right to refuse employment under the conditions therein specified to lift the
disqualification for withdrawal from the labor market. There was no intention
on the part of the Legislature to transform a continuing disqualification for
withdrawal from the labor market to a disqualification for job refusal, or to
authorize an additional disqualification based on job refusal on top of the
disqualification for withdrawal from the labor market. There is therefore no
basis in the Law for the imposition of an additional disqualification from
benefits for refusing employment during a period when a claimant is
disqualified for withdrawal from the labor market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

general principle that a claimant who is genuinely unavailable may not be
disqualified for a &quot;refusal&quot; which occurs during the period of his
unavailability. However, there are, from time to time, instances in which
Referee and Appeal Board decisions uphold refusal disqualification even though
there appears to be concurrent unavailability. Against that, there have been
other cases where a refusal disqualification has been overruled under such

between the two cases is the fact that in case #25,970-50, the claimant’s
unavailability was due to a restriction prompted by compelling reasons, that
is, the needs for the care of claimant’s child, whereas in case #25,287-50
there were only self-imposed reasons of convenience and preference. In the
latter case, no compelling need existed for the claimant to abstain from work
while her daughter had come for a visit. The circumstances which rendered
claimant &quot;unavailable&quot; were temporary and arbitrary, were entirely within
claimant’s control, and could be lifted at any time at will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

conclusion has broad aspects which, at the same time, show its importance and
reasonableness. If an &quot;unavailability&quot; of this nature were to
preclude the imposition of a refusal disqualification, the door would be open
for any claimant to forestall such disqualification. All the claimant would
have to do, is to render himself &quot;unavailable&quot; for a short time when
the offer of an undesired job has been made or is impending, by deciding to
take a vacation, to attend to personal business, etc. The consequences of a
refusal could, in this manner, be avoided. However, the Appeal Board has
demonstrated that such evasion of a statutory penalty will not be allowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hotels which operate in and around Narrowsburg. During the last seven years,
claimant was employed by one resort hotel between April and October of each
year, except for the past two years when she had additional employment for a
period of two weeks during the hunting season. Claimant was employed with the
resort hotel until October 1949. She filed a claim for benefits on October 17,
1949 and continued reporting thereafter. The claimant was a duly licensed
driver and had a car at her disposal for the past several years. During these
years, claimant has nevertheless restricted herself to employment in
Narrowsburg. There is no possibility of employment between October and April in
Narrowsburg. Persons residing in Narrowsburg are generally employed in
Honesdale. There is a possibility of employment in Liberty and Monticello. It
would take claimant approximately one-half to three-quarters of an hour by car
to travel from her home to either Liberty or Monticello. Claimant made no
effort to obtain employment in Honesdale, Liberty or Monticello. Based on
interviews with the claimant, the local office issued an initial determination
ruling claimant ineligible for benefits, effective April 17, 1950, on the ground
that she was unavailable for employment. The claimant contested the initial
determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial
determination and the Industrial Commissioner appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant filed an original claim for benefits
on January 11, 1950. In connection therewith he was ruled ineligible for
benefits because of insufficient earnings in the base year 1948 to qualify for
benefits. Claimant had worked for about 15 months to January 7, 1950 as a
salesman for a coal and lumber company. In filing his claim on January 11, he
stated that he left or lost his job because of &quot;no business.&quot;
Actually he was asked to resign because of misuse of company funds. On January
30, 1950, the local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from January 8 to February 25, 1950 for loss of employment through
misconduct in connection therewith. Another initial determination was issued that
claimant made a wilful false statement to obtain benefits and imposing a
forfeiture of 24 effective days. Claimant filed an original claim for benefits
in the new benefit year commencing June 2, 1950. He was ruled eligible for
benefits at the rate of $26 per week on the basis of his 1949 base year
earnings. Claimant was advised that the forfeiture of 24 effective days imposed
in January 1950 would be applied against his benefit rights in that benefit
year. He protested and requested a hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant, in connection with his claim for benefits of June 2, 1950, was
subject to a forfeiture of 24 effective days pursuant to the initial
determination of the local office issued on January 30,1950. The referee
pointed out that claimant was ineligible for benefits when he filed his claim
in January 1950, that he had no benefit rights which could be made the subject
of a wilful misrepresentation and that consequently the forfeiture penalty did
not carryover to the new benefit year. We agree with the result reached by the
referee. The initial determination containing the forfeiture of benefits was
issued in connection with a claim for benefits which proved to be of no effect.
In Appeal Board, 130-38, the Board ruled that a claimant was entitled to
accumulate waiting period during a period in which he was ineligible for
benefits and prior to the benefit year in which he had benefit rights. The

of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board which modified and as modified
affirmed a referee’s decision overruling an initial determination of the

The false statement was made in January 1950, to obtain a benefit to which it
was found claimant was then ineligible because of insufficient earnings in his
base year of 1948. The forfeiture aforesaid was then imposed and applied
against him later when in the next benefit year and in June 1950, he again
filed for benefits. This in our view the statute expressly permits. Decision

reinstated, without costs. (September 19, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a position as a baker of white and rye bread and rolls, American style, with a
retail bakery at $65 a week. Claimant refused the referral on the ground that
it was not in his line of work. The difference between American style baking
and French-Italian baking is substantial, in that the mixing of the dough, oven
temperature requirements and cutting the bread all differ. The local office
issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits
on the ground that, without good cause, he refused employment for which he is
reasonably fitted by training and experience. Claimant protested the initial
determination and requested a hearing. The referee sustained the initial

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board, which reversed a decision of an unemployment insurance referee, and
overruled an initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner which
disqualified claimant for benefits because he refused an offer of employment
for which he was reasonably fitted by training and experience without good
cause. Claimant is a baker. Prior to filing for unemployment insurance benefits
he had been employed as such at a wage of $50 per week. His experience had been
limited to baking Italian and French bread and cakes. He was referred to a job
offer at a wage of $65 per week where his duties would be to mix and bake
American style bread and rolls. There are some differences in the baking
process of the different types, but the prospective employer indicated a
willingness to employ claimant, with knowledge of his previous limited
experience, and to teach him the American method of baking. Claimant refused to
even try the proffered employment solely on the ground that the work did not
consist of Italian or French style baking. Such refusal was unreasonable. The
state does not contemplate such a precise selection of employment by a
claimant. He may not enjoy benefits while waiting for a job which fits his
training and experience with complete exactness. If he is reasonably fitted by
training and experience for the offered employment, as was the case here, his
refusal is without good cause as a matter of law. Decision of the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board, reversed, on the law, and the initial determination of
the Industrial Commissioner reinstated, without costs (September 19, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Fact</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which the claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared
and testified. Claimant, a fur finisher, filed a claim for benefits on June 8,
1950. By an initial determination, issued on June 27, 1950, claimant was
declared ineligible because of unavailability, effective June 8, 1950, and she
was disqualified, effective June 23, 1950, because of refusal of employment
without good cause. Claimant resides at Oceanside. She had been employed as a
fur finisher in New York City earning a weekly salary of $50. She was laid off
in the latter part of December 1949, due to slack conditions in the fur
industry. Subsequent to the filing of the claim for benefits, claimant
communicated with her former New York City employer, in an attempt to ascertain
whether work was available for her. She learned that conditions in the fur
industry were still slack and that there was little likelihood that work would
be available for her until about July. Claimant indicated to a representative
of the insurance office that she would prefer to avoid work in Manhattan in the
event it were possible for her to obtain a job closer to home. She made no
independent inquiries for work in establishments in Queens and Nassau counties
prior to July, because she was aware of the fact that slow conditions in the
fur industry made it rather unlikely that she would expect employment during
June. Opportunities for work in claimant’s occupation are not plentiful in
Nassau and Queens counties but there are, nevertheless, some firms which
utilize the skills of fur finishers. Persons employed in claimant’s occupation
in Queens and Nassau counties are usually paid approximately $50 weekly. On
June 22, 1950, claimant was referred to an employer who had placed a job order
for a finisher to perform a hand-sewing operation on ladies’ coats, at a
starting salary of $36 for the first week and $40 for the second week, those
being the wages usually paid to persons similarly employed in the area. The
duties of the job involved a lesser skill than that possessed by the claimant.
Claimant reported to the prospective employer who suggested that she submit to
a test in order to enable the employer to determine the salary that would be
offered. Accordingly, claimant worked for the employer on June 23, without
having been advised of the salary which would be paid to her. At the end of the
day, she inquired with respect to the wages she would receive, and the employer
indicated that she would receive $35 weekly at the start of her employment. He
told her that she would receive an increase to $40 weekly at a subsequent time.
Claimant refused to continue in the employment because of her objection to the
wage rate offered and for the reason that she objected to the work required of
her, since it was different from that she had performed as a fur finisher.
Claimant was unwilling to accept the work for a temporary period, until
conditions in the fur industry became more active, for the reason that she
expected that work there would commence soon after the date of the offer and
that, if she accepted the employment, she would be precluded from making a
search for work in her own occupation. Commencing with the beginning of July,
claimant conducted an active independent search for work in Nassau and Queens
counties. She filed applications for employment in many establishments which
utilized her skills. As a result of her independent efforts, she obtained
employment for a period of about one week early in August at an establishment
in Jamaica, and she again obtained employment beginning August 7 at an establishment
in Merrick. She receives a salary of $50 weekly in her present employment.
Between the date of the filing of her original claim and the date of the
referral mentioned above, claimant had reported to the employment office at
Rockville Centre on four occasions, but no offers of employment were made prior
to June 22, because there were no suitable job openings available.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The evidence does not
indicate that claimant rendered herself unavailable for work at any time during
the period here at issue. The only possible basis for the determination is
claimant’s statement to the effect that she had not made an independent search
for work and that she preferred to avoid working in Manhattan. Neither of those
statements, under the circumstances here disclosed, may be accepted as
conclusive indication of her unavailability for work. Claimant, in fact,
communicated with her former New York City employer for the purpose of
ascertaining whether work was available for her so that it is evident that her
statement with regard to employment in Manhattan was not an absolute
restriction against work there, but merely an indication of preference. In view
of the fact that it was apparent to claimant that activity in the fur industry
had not yet commenced during June, it is understandable that claimant should
not have made solicitations in stores in Queens and Nassau counties in her
occupation. The fact that the employment office in Rockville Centre made no
offers of employment to claimant despite four reports during June, it is
understandable that claimant should not have made solicitations in stores in
Queens and Nassau counties in her occupation. The fact that the employment
office is Rockville Centre made no offers of employment to claimant despite
four reports during June is further cogent evidence of the fact that claimant’s
unemployment during that period is not attributable to any lack of independent
efforts on her part. I also conclude that claimant had good cause to refuse the
employment offered on June 22, irrespective of the fact that the wages offered
to the claimant may have compared favorably with the rate usually paid to
persons performing similar types of work. It affirmatively appears that the job
would not have utilized all of the skills which claimant had acquired. The job
involved a downgrading which is abhorrent to all good labor practices. Claimant
had acquired skills usable in the labor market which are sufficient to produce
a weekly wage of approximately $50. Under these circumstances, it may not be
said that her refusal of a job which could produce wages of only $35 weekly was
without good cause. The initial determinations are in all respects overruled.

Opinion and Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is a fur
finisher. Her last employment before filing her claim for unemployment
insurance benefits was at the rate of $50.00 a week. She was referred for work
as a finisher and sewer on ladies’ coats at a rate which would be $40.00
beginning with the second week. This was refused by claimant because of the
wage and because the work differed from her work as a fur finisher. The
Commissioner held her disqualified because of her refusal of employment without
good cause; but the Appeal Board has decided that since the offered employment
would not have utilized all the skills which claimant had acquired she was
justified in refusing it. The statutory test of disqualification is the refusal
of employment for which claimant is reasonably fitted by training and experience.
The full utilization of skills is desirable, but it is not the test fixed by
the law. There may be times during which, as here, there is temporarily no work
which will fully utilize all of claimant’s skills. While that period lasts, at
least, the statute is met if employment for which claimant is fitted &quot;by
training and experience&quot; is offered. When other employment which will use
the higher skills becomes available, it should then be offered. (Cf.&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Delgado</u>, 278 App. Div. 237). There is no finding here that claimant was
not reasonably fitted by training and experience for work offered, or that the
wage offered was not the prevailing wage for that work. Decision of the Appeal
Board reversed on the law and the determination of the Industrial Commissioner
reinstated, without costs. (September 19, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in this decision while not new stresses again that where employment

this thought by stating that &quot;The&nbsp;<u>full utilization of skills</u>&nbsp;is

times during which * * * there is temporarily no work, which will fully utilize

adjusted herself to the work. The Board sustained the refusal disqualification

approximately 20 years. For the last ten years, he has been employed in the
capacity of a messenger or mutuel clerk. The usual racing season in New York
State operates from April 1 to November 15. During the 20 years of claimant's
employment at race tracks, he concededly did not work between November 15 and
April 1. The racing season in Miami, Florida, commences in the middle of
January and the personnel are employed prior thereto. Under the Florida law, 85
per cent of all race track employees must be permanent residents of Miami,
Florida. Claimant left New York City on January 8, 1951 en route to Miami,
Florida, allegedly to seek employment at the race tracks there. Shortly after
his arrival he was made aware that there was no employment for him at the race
tracks. Claimant nevertheless continued to remain in Florida for some time
during which period he made no effort to seek employment in any other
occupation. Upon claimant's return to New York, he became reemployed on April
2, 1951 at the race track. The local office issued an initial determination
holding claimant unavailable for employment during his sojourn in Miami,
Florida. Claimant contested the said initial determination and requested a
hearing before a referee. The referee thereafter overruled the initial
determination. From such decision the Industrial Commissioner now appeals to
this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant was employed for six years as a
driver and loader of trucks for a concern located at 234 Street in the Bronx.
He resided in the Bronx and traveled to work daily either by bus or in his own
automobile. His transportation expense was 20 cents a day by bus and about $3 a
week when he used his car. Claimant's terminal salary was $60 a week for a 54
hour week. Claimant was required to vacate his Bronx residence when the
property was taken by condemnation proceedings instituted by the City of New
York. Claimant sought other housing accommodations in the same neighborhood or
the immediate vicinity for over a year. In December 1950 he purchased a home in
Westwood, New Jersey, and he and his family moved from the Bronx in January
1951. On February 16, 1951 claimant left his job because he claimed the
traveling expense and time consumed in traveling were too great. He contended
that the fare from Westwood, New Jersey to the place of his employment amounted
to $1.10 a day by bus, and about $10 a week when he used his car. The travel
time by bus to his new residence was close to two hours. Claimant filed a claim
for benefits and registered for employment at a New York City local office on
February 19, 1951. Based on the above facts, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive
days from February 19, 1951 for voluntarily leaving his last employment without
good cause. Claimant protested this ruling and requested a hearing. This
resulted in a referee's decision overruling the initial determination. The
Industrial Commissioner appeals from such decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee held that claimant had good cause
to leave his employment because he was compelled to change his residence and
the traveling expense from his new home to the place of his employment was
excessive. We are not in accord with this reasoning. Claimant increased his
traveling expenses when he changed his residence from the Bronx to Westwood,
new Jersey. Even though he may have been compelled to vacate his former
residence in the Bronx by reason of the condemnation proceedings, nevertheless,
the record fails to convince us that it was impossible for claimant to obtain
other living quarters in the City of New York which would be more accessible to
claimant's place of employment. We find that the increase in traveling expense
was caused by the action of claimant in moving to Westwood, New Jersey.
Consequently, when he left his employment for the above reason, claimant left
without good cause within the meaning of the Law (see Appeal Board, 22,445-50;
23,687-50; 26,213-51)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

special importance to local offices in the suburban Metropolitan area.
Generally, a daily increase of 90 cents in transportation cost, necessitating
approximately four hours traveling time, would be good cause for voluntarily
leaving employment. However, since such condition in the instant case was
caused by claimant's own discretionary action, which apparently was not of a
compelling nature, claimant's leaving was without good cause. The Bard's
conclusion lends itself to the adoption of guiding principles in at least two

which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner and of the
employer appeared and testified. Claimant a chauffeur on a news route, filed
for benefits on August 29, 1949. By initial determination, effective September
10, he was disqualified for refusal of employment. Claimant was employed by the
employer for four and one half years to August 11. He worked five nights per week
and was paid $82.75 for five-day, forty-hour week. His hours of work were from
12 midnight to 8 a.m. About two weeks prior to August 16, claimant was placed
on a four-day week, whereas one employee, junior in service to him, worked five
days per week. Claimant's employment was terminated on August 16. On August 17,
he became engaged in a business venture, which he left on that day, on the
advice of this attorney. The employer advised the insurance office that on
September 9, he called claimant and offered him work on Thursday and Saturday
nights, at his regular rate of pay. Claimant stated that the offer of
employment was made on September 3. Claimant refused to accept the job because
he wanted full-time work, and not part-time work. The rate of pay for Saturday
work was $17.11 for eight hours and for weekday work $16.41 for eight hours.
Overtime was paid after eight hours. The claimant, at present is suing his
employer for back pay allegedly due him for unrecompensed overtime work.
Claimant became employed on September 26, as a promotion worker with a news
company and as of the date of the hearing was still so employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commissioner has appealed from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board which affirmed the decision of an unemployment insurance referee
overruling an initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner
disqualifying claimant for unemployment insurance benefits because of his
refusal of an offer of employment for which he was reasonably fitted by
training and experience, without good cause. Claimant is a chauffeur on a news
route. He was employed by the Brownsville News Company for four and one-half
years prior to August 1949. He worked five nights a week and was paid $82.72
for a five day, forty-hour week. His hours of employment were from twelve
midnight to 8: a.m. About two weeks prior to August 16, 1949, claimant was
placed on a four-day week. He resigned his employment on that day to engage in
business for himself. On the advice of his attorney, he left this business
which lasted but a single day. He thereupon became unemployed and filed for
benefits on August 29, 1949. His former employer offered claimant work on
Thursday and Saturday nights at his regular rate of pay. The offer was refused
by the claimant because he wanted full-time work and not part-time. The rate of
pay for weekday work was $16.41 for eight hours and for Saturday, $17.11 for a
like period. Overtime was paid after eight hours. We have concluded that
claimant's refusal of the offer of part-time employment without good cause is a
matter of law. Decision appealed from reversed, on the law, and the initial
determination of the Industrial Commissioner reinstated, without cost.

wrapper in a department store in Rochester, New York. She worked during the
winter and &quot;rush&quot; seasons only but withdrew from the labor market in
the summers in order to devote her time to her two children. In previous years,
she had worked in a cannery as a laborer during the canning season and she had
done work as a domestic. During the war she worked for one year in an optical
manufacturing plant as a solderer, which job she left due to illness. Claimant
always worked full time hours on these various jobs. Claimant was recalled to
work at the department store in September 1949. Her hours of work were from
9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. or 6 p.m. and she received $30 for a 40-hour week.
Claimant was laid off by the employer because of lack of work and she filed a
claim for benefits on January 23, 1950. On March 28, 1950, the employment
office offered claimant work at a bottle company as an inspector at $.80 per
hour with hours 9 a.m. to 3 or 4 p.m., three or four days a week. Her weekly
earnings on that job would vary from $12 to a maximum of $19.20, depending on
the amount of work the employer would have for her. Claimant refused the offer
stating that she wanted a full-time job. An initial determination was issued
disqualifying her from benefits for refusal of employment without good cause or
in the alternative, that she was unavailable for employment. In May 1950, the
department store called claimant back and she worked there for three weeks. She
had a standing application for work on file at the store. Claimant sought work
elsewhere by applying at a laundry and at an electrical appliance store. She
also sought work through newspaper advertisements. No other offer of employment
was made to the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: There being no appeal on the issue of
availability for employment which was decided in claimant's favor, the only
issue before us is whether claimant was justified in refusing the offer of
employment or part-time work. Although claimant's work history shows a number
of interruptions due to illnesses and her obligation to her children, the fact
remains that over a period of many years she never worked less than full-time.
It does not appear that she was an applicant for unemployment insurance
benefits during the temporary periods when she was compelled to leave the labor
market. The only restriction claimant ever placed on her availability was that
she wanted a full week's work. When recalled to the department store in May
1950, she again received full-time work. The job offered claimant would provide
her only with three or four partial days work a week and a wage of from $12 to
$19.20. It was not contended that full-time work was unobtainable in the City
of Rochester at the time. Although the record does not specifically cover the
subject, the prevailing hours in claimant's usual lines of work is normally
about $40 per week. Under section 593.2(d) of the Unemployment Insurance law no
refusal to accept employment shall be deemed without good cause if the
&quot;hours or conditions offered are substantially less favorable to the
claimant than those prevailing for similar work in the locality.&quot; This
provision of law appears to be applicable to the instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board which had reversed the decision of the referee sustaining that portion of
the initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner disqualifying claimant
for unemployment insurance on the ground she refused a referral of employment
without good cause. Claimant is married and resides with her husband. They have
two children. Her employment history is one of seasonal and intermittent
employment. She did not work during the summer months because she had to take care
of her children during their summer vacations. Her last employment was in a
department store, as a wrapper in the delivery department, where her wages were
at the rate of $.75 an hour for a forty hour week. After becoming unemployed
she was offered work with a manufacturer of soft drinks, as an inspector and
packer, with wages at $.80 an hour, and with hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., for
three or four days a week. She refused this offer of employment on the basis
that it was not for a full week, and that she preferred working from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m., and did not want to work on Saturdays. No claim is made that she was
not fitted by training and experience for the proffered employment, that the
wages per hour were unsatisfactory, or that the place of employment was not
conveniently accessible. We think the decision of the Board was erroneous as a
matter of law. An affirmance thereof would establish the principle that an
unemployed claimant may refuse any work offer in which he or she is not to be
employed for a full week. There is no such requirement in the statute, and
indeed it is inconsistent with the provisions of the statute for compensating
partial unemployment (Section 523 and 590, subd. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Musicians’ Union in New York City. He worked from July 1, 1950 to September 4,
1950 at an engagement in New Jersey. After the completion of the engagement, he
moved to Miami Beach, Florida, because members of his family who are musicians
reside in that locality and he expected to be married to a Florida resident.
Upon claimant’s arrival in Miami on September 8, 1950 he applied for a transfer
of his membership to his Miami local union. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
in Miami, Florida, against New York as the liable State on October 9, 1950.
Under the union regulations, a transient union member for a 90-day period
cannot accept full-time engagements but can only work club dates or be hired
for single engagements, but may perform such work seven days a week. Members of
the Miami local work only six days a week. On December 20, 1950, claimant obtained
steady full-time employment as a musician at a social club in the Miami area.
The Out-of-State Resident Unit issued an initial determination effective
October 9, 1950 holding that claimant was unavailable for employment. The basis
for the determination was that claimant was not permitted by his union to
accept full-time employment for 90 days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

theory that claimant moved to a primarily resort area where work in his regular
occupation was extremely limited and his possibilities of obtaining full-time
employment due to his union status were highly remote. We are unable to agree
with his conclusion. There is no question that claimant removed to Florida with
the intention of working there and of remaining there permanently. The evidence
shows that claimant exerted diligent efforts to obtain employment during the
period in question, and that he secured a permanent job as the result of such
efforts. Claimant, under the union regulations, was not precluded from
obtaining employment during the 90-day period. He was permitted to accept club
dates or single engagements seven days a week while union members in the area
having full status worked only six days a week. It cannot be said that this
limitation of itself rendered him unavailable for employment during the 90-day
period (Appeal Board, 27,689-51). The record herein shows that claimant has met
the test heretofore laid down by the Board with respect to persons moving to a
resort area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which the claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared
and testified. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on April 19, 1950. By
initial determination she was disqualified for refusal of employment, effective
July 6, and also ruled ineligible because she was not available for employment
due to restrictions as to rate of pay, effective July 6. Claimant had
previously worked as a stenographer in a chemical firm for over five years. She
attained a rate of $58 per week. On July 6, she refused employment as a stenographer
at $180 per month because of the rate. Claimant accepted employment in another
plant of the same employer on January 11, 1951, as a &quot;chemical&quot;
stenographer at $260 per month. She was hired for this job after taking
typewriting and shorthand tests. According to the employment representative,
job orders received in the employment office quoted from $40 to $45 per week
for experienced stenographers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant acted as a
reasonably prudent person in refusing employment at $180 per month because of
the type of work and the rate of pay. She had substantial training and
experience as a &quot;chemical&quot; stenographer at a substantially higher
rate of pay. She was entitled to seek employment at a skill comparable with her
previous employment. The reasonableness of her actions is demonstrated by the
fact that she found employment at a higher rate of pay utilizing her special
skill. Court decisions have held that an individual cannot refuse employment at
a slightly lesser degree of skill. (<u>Matter of Heater</u>, 270 App. Div. 311,
reversing Appeal Board 11,632-45). The employment which claimant had and the
re-employment which she obtained demonstrated a substantially greater skill. In
seeking employment at this level, claimant did not unreasonably restrict her
availability for employment. The initial determinations are overruled.

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Appeal by the
Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board. Claimant was employed for about six years as a stenographer and typist
for a chemical company. She regarded herself as a &quot;chemical
stenographer.&quot; When she left this employment due to pregnancy she was
receiving $58 a week. When she returned to the labor market she filed a claim
for unemployment insurance benefits, and four months later she was offered
employment as a stenographer with an electro-metallurgical company at $180 a
month. The &quot;going rate&quot; for experienced stenographers in the area was
then $40 to $45 a week. Claimant refused the offer because she was dissatisfied
with the salary and objected to traveling half an hour by bus, and was declared
ineligible for benefits. This determination has been reversed by the Appeal
Board because claimant's training and experience as a &quot;chemical
stenographer entitled her to seek employment &quot;at a skill comparable with
her previous employment.&quot; That the full utilization of all skills is not
the effective test to be applied under the statute, but rather the availability
of work for which the claimant is fitted by training and experience is being
made plain by a series of judicial interpretations of which&nbsp;<u>Matter of
DeBruyne</u>&nbsp;(278 App. Div.);&nbsp;<u>Matter of Strazza</u>&nbsp;(278 App.
Div. 1036);&nbsp;<u>Matter of DeBruyne</u>&nbsp;(278 App. Div. 1036), are
examples. Decision of the Appeal Board reversed on the law, and the
determination of the Industrial Commissioner reinstated. (November 30, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were not allocable to any specific days; that he was a part-time employee and
not totally unemployed during the entire period of his contract. In Appeal
Board, 4051-40, the claimant was elected a councilman of the City of Glens Falls

claimant's monthly salary was compensation for his employment and that claimant
was not totally unemployed during the entire term of his office. However, the
decision in this case was predicated upon the definition of total unemployment
as it existed in the law prior to the enactment of the day base plan. In a more
recent case, Appeal Board, 21,597-49, the claimant was the local truant officer
and his duties required him to investigate cases of delinquent children. His
services were performed during the daytime. The Appeal Board held he was not
totally unemployed. In the case now on appeal, however, the claimant was not
engaged in employment of a continuous nature. The $400 he received annually was
paid to him for services he rendered the school board by attending their
meetings on 13 evenings during the year. Outside of the duties he performed at
these meetings, there were no other services which claimant was obliged to
render to the school board. He was not a member of the State Retirement System
and could not accumulate any retirement benefits. At not time did the services
rendered by him on the 13 occasions when he attended the meetings interfere
with claimant's availability for other employment. We find, therefore, that
only on the 13 occasions during the year when claimant attended the meetings of
the school board and when he attended the annual meeting of all of the voters
of the community, claimant was not totally unemployed. With regard to the issue
of claimant's failure to comply with reporting requirements from October 25
through November 5, 1950, we find that claimant has offered no valid excuse for
his failure to report to the local office. Therefore, he was properly held to
be ineligible for benefits during that period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

67 years of age. The claimant receives a pension of $327 a month from the

not obtain employment with the telephone company or with any company affiliated

of the companies informed the claimant that they retired their employees at 65.
He wrote such letters from June 1949, until December 1949, when he exhausted
his benefits in that year. He again filed a claim in June 1950, and wrote
similar letter to companies throughout the country until December 1950, when he
again exhausted his claim. He did not write any letters in any period between
December of 1949 and June 1950, or between December 1950 and June 1951. When he
again filed his claim in June 1951, he wrote additional letters to various

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant’s sole efforts to obtain employment
were in the form of letters to prospective employers. He wrote such letters for
26 weeks following his retirement. After he collected his 26 benefit checks, he
ceased reporting and cased writing letters. When the new benefit year started,
he reported again, wrote letters for 26 weeks until he exhausted his benefits
and again stopped writing letters and reporting to the local office.
Thereafter, he moved to a cottage in the country from his home in the city.
When he ascertained that by virtue of recent legislation it was possible to
file for two additional checks, he reported to the local office and again wrote
letters for two weeks. He was denied benefits for these additional two weeks.
The referee decided that the fact that a claimant’s applications for work
coincided with this claim for benefits, only raised a &quot;suspicion&quot;
that claimant’s search was not diligent or real. We are not in accord with the
reasoning of the referee. Any analysis of the record leads to the inevitable
conclusion that claimant’s efforts to obtain employment were more apparent than
real. A person genuinely interested in obtaining employment does not restrict
or limit his efforts to the period during which he is obtaining benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and is a registered nurse. She had worked in this capacity for several years.
She was employed as an industrial nurse at a canning plant in Fulton, New York,
from 9:00 a .m. to 6:00 p.m. for three years ending 1950 during the season from
May to November. During the other months of the year, she worked as a private
nurse either in private homes or in hospitals. Claimant filed a claim for
benefits on October 23, 1950. She had heart attack in 1945 and can no longer
perform general duty nursing at a hospital since this work requires that the
patient be lifted from time to time and involves other arduous duties. She was
willing to accept private duty at a hospital or at a home. Her name was listed
at hospital for private duty. She worked as a private nurse on October 26,
October 27, November 1 to November 3, November 10 to November 13 and on
November 15, November 16 and November 20, 1950. She filed an additional claim
for benefits on November 21, 1950. On November 21, 1950, claimant was referred
to a hospital as a general duty nurse. Claimant refused the referral stating
that she was unwilling to accept general duty and she restricted herself to
private duty. It was contended that if claimant accepted the offer, a nurse's
aide would assist her with the more arduous duties, such as lifting the
patient. The local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits, effective November 21, 1950, for refusal of
employment without good cause. It also issued an alternate determination,
effective the aforesaid date that claimant was unavailable for employment
because her restrictions concerning the type of nursing duty she was willing to
accept. Claimant worked as a private nurse from December 2 to December 5 and on
December 9, 1950. She filed an additional claim for benefits on December 11,
1950 and was credited with one statutory week. She accepted an assignment as
private nurse for a patient at a hospital from December 20, 1950 to December
30, 1950. She filed an additional claim on January 1, 1951 and reported to
March 27, 1951. She had been working steadily since March 28, 1951 as a private
nurse. She intended to resume work as an industrial nurse for her former
employer the latter part of May 1951.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee ruled that because of claimant’s
heart condition, she was justified in refusing to do general duty nursing in a
hospital. He also overruled the alternate determination on the premise that
claimant was available as a private duty nurse and there were opportunities for
her to obtain such work. The Industrial Commissioner argued that claimant’s
refusal of the employment offered was without good cause on the premise that if
claimant were required to lift patients in the course of her duties, the
services of a nurse’s aide would be available to her. It is also contended that
since claimant was seeking private duty nursing until she was recalled at the
cannery, she rendered herself unavailable for employment. The Industrial
Commissioner urges that a person who seeks work only as a private duty nurse is
not in the labor market because a nurse working under such circumstances is not
an employee but an independent contractor. The record supports the conclusion
of the referee that because of her heart condition, claimant was justified in
refusing the offer of employment as a general duty nurse in a hospital.
However, there is merit to the contention that claimant must be deemed
unavailable for employment. Claimant, during the period in question, restricted
herself to private duty nursing. It is well recognized that registered nurses
assigned to private patients are not employees of the patient but are
self-employed (Appeal Board, 12,918-46). Under these circumstances we do not
believe that it can be said that claimant was in the labor market or available
for employment within the contemplation of the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held in
Illinois and in New York at which claimant and representatives of the
Industrial Commissioner and of claimant's former employer, respectively,
appeared and testified. Claimant filed for benefits on August 27, 1951, in
Chicago, Illinois. By initial determination effective the same date, claimant
was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of employment. Claimant worked
from January 1950 up to July 15, 1951, as a salesperson of a waterproofing
compound, on a commission basis. His work required him to travel to different
states and absent himself from home over extended periods of time. Claimant is
married and resides with his wife and daughter. They strongly objected to his
long absences from home. There were domestic difficulties that were aggravated
by his absences. Claimant's wife threatened to leave him if he continued in his
job. He, therefore, left it to prevent domestic discord. He obtained other
employment on September 13 and is still so employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

left his employment for a compelling reason. His work required him to be absent
from home over long periods of time. Had he continued in his employment, his

of his employment to preserve it, constituted good cause for leaving the job
under the Unemployment Insurance Law. The initial determination is overruled.

dresses, filed an additional claim for benefits and registered for employment
on April 30, 1951. She worked for an employer all day on May 23, 1951 and three
hours in the morning of May 24, 1951 (Thursday) when she left this employment.
She voluntarily reported to the employment service on the afternoon of May 24,
1951 when she was referred to a job on a piece work basis with a manufacturer
of dresses. Claimant refused the referral stating &quot;I cannot make out on a
cheaper line.&quot; She next reported at the local office on May 29, 1951
(Tuesday) at which time she was credited with an additional claim effective May
28, 1951. On May 25, 1951, the local office issued an initial determination effective
May 24, 1951 disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits on the ground that
she refused employment without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee held that claimant was fitted by
training and experience for the employment offered her on May 24, 1951, and
that the wages were in accordance with union standards prevailing in the
industry. He ruled, however, that inasmuch as claimant could not accrue benefit
rights on May 24, 1951, since she had worked part of that day, she could not be
disqualified for refusal of employment on the same day because it was during a
period within which claimant was not &quot;in benefits.&quot; The Industrial
Commissioner contends that the disqualification was properly imposed because
claimant was &quot;in benefits&quot; during the entire statutory week ending
May 27, 1951. In support of his contention, he relies on the amended Regulation
40 of the Industrial Commissioner whereby a claimant is no longer required to
re-file for benefits immediately after a spell of employment, but need only report
at the local insurance office on his regular reporting day, at which time he is
permitted to certify to his days of total unemployment in the preceding
statutory week. It is argued that by virtue of claimant's reporting on May 29,
1951 and her certification at that time for the week ending May 27, 1951 she
was actually a benefit claimant throughout that week. We believe that the
Industrial Commissioner's position is well taken. We cannot agree that the fact
that claimant could not receive credit for an &quot;effective day&quot; of
total unemployment for May 24, 1951 is decisive of the issue before us. Under
the Commissioner's regulations, a benefit claim is deemed continually in effect
during the period that a claimant reports regularly on his assigned reporting
dates. It therefore follows that claimant herein was eligible for benefits
during the statutory week ending May 27, 1951 and that the disqualification for
refusal of employment was proper under Section 593.2 of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

full-time workers and &quot;qualified employees&quot; eligible to receive
benefits under the above plan. During the period in question, the normal hours
of work in the plant were 40 hours per week or an average of 173 hours per
month. Following previous layoffs in the early months of 1950, claimants were
called back to work in April 1950. They were again laid off on May 19, 1950 and
filed additional claims for benefits on May 20, 1950. All of the claimants
received, under the plan, 20 hours wages for the month of May 1950 representing
the difference between 140 hours and the hours they had actually worked in that
month. In June and July 1950, claimants again suffered layoff periods for which
they filed additional claims for benefits. They received guaranteed wages under
the plan for these months where they had received less than the 140 guaranteed
hours of work in the month. Upon a further layoff, claimants filed additional
claims on September 25, 1950 and reported thereafter for the period of the
layoff, which continued through the months of October and November 1950.
Claimants received 70 hours layoff pay for each of these months as provided in
paragraph 3 of the plan. During layoff periods, employees were permitted to
seek and obtain employment elsewhere. If they received part-time work they were
paid benefits under the plan on a pro rata basis up to the time they started
such work. All laid off employees were retained on the employer's payroll
record and were subject to be called back to work when needed. Only those who
failed to return to work when recalled were dropped from the payroll. During
the winter season of 1950, a number of workers obtained full-time employment
elsewhere as a result of which they became ineligible to receive layoff time
for the period of such employment. Some returned to work with the employer when
recalled and others failed to do so and were dropped from its payroll. The
local office issued initial determinations with respect to each of the
claimants disqualifying them from receiving benefits, effective May 22, 1950,
on the ground that they were not totally unemployed because they were receiving
payments from the employer under the guaranteed wage plan. Claimants protested
and requested hearings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee sustained the initial
determinations of the local office on the theory that claimants, during the
period in question, were on the employer's payroll, subject to its direction
and control and prohibited from accepting other than casual employment. He
concluded that these elements established that claimants were no totally
unemployed. We are unable to accept the referee's conclusions. The present
record shows that although claimants were retained on the employer's payroll
during layoff periods and were subject to recall to work, they were not
prohibited from accepting full-time employment elsewhere. No question has been
raised in this case as to the availability of these claimants or their
willingness to accept employment with other employers if the same had been
obtainable. The sole question therefore is whether or not the receipt of
benefits by these claimants, pursuant to the guaranteed work plan, rendered
then not totally unemployed so as to be barred from receiving unemployment
insurance benefits. The purpose of the employer's guaranteed work plan is to
guarantee a minimum income to qualified employees during periods of slack
business and to provide partial compensation to them for holding themselves in
readiness for prompt return to work when recalled. The fact that employees are
retained on the employer's payroll during layoff periods cannot be
determinative of the issues herein. This is true of the average case of a
temporary layoff where the right to the temporarily unemployed worker, who is
otherwise qualified, to unemployment insurance benefits is unquestioned. The
employer's plan which was instituted in 1934, in effect, guarantees to the
worker wages equivalent to their average earnings in four 35-hour work weeks in
each month. However, when no work is performed during the month by the worker,
the plan guarantees the equivalent of only two 35-hour work weeks. Section 522
of the Labor Law reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>TOTAL
UNEMPLOYMENT. &quot;Total unemployment&quot; means the total lack of any
employment on any day, caused by the inability of a claimant who is capable of
an available for work to engage in his usual employment or in any other for
which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience. The term
&quot;employment&quot; as used in this section means any employment including
that not defined in this title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Although the plan falls
short of guaranteeing to the unemployed worker the amount of his earnings wen
fully employed, we are constrained to hold that for the purposes of
unemployment insurance the claimants cannot be regarded as totally unemployed
in any part of a month in which they received guaranteed time under paragraph 2
of the plan. In our opinion it would not be within the spirit of the
Unemployment Insurance Law to award to these claimants unemployment insurance
benefits to supplement their earnings in the months during which they had some
employment with the employer and were paid by the employer for the minimum
hours of work contemplated by the parties, under such circumstances. However, a
different result should follow with respect to the months when claimants
performed no work for the employer and received from it only 70 hours layoff
pay, representing the equivalent of two 35-hour weeks of work. This was the
case with respect to claimants for the months of October and November 1950. A
reasonable construction of the statute, it seems to us, permits a holding that
each claimant is entitled to be credited with two statutory weeks of total
unemployment in any month in which she was unemployed and received from the
employer 70 hours lay off pay. Accordingly, each claimant herein should be
credited with two statutory weeks of total unemployment in the months of
October and November 1950.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

New York, pursuant to leave granted by the latter-named Court. On April 24,
1953, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision and made an order reversing
the aforementioned order of the Appellate Division, and the determination of
the Appeal Board, and directed that the matter be remanded to the Appeal Board for
further proceedings in accord with the opinion of the Court of Appeals (305
N.Y. 264). On May 6, 1953, an order on the remittitur of the Court of Appeals
was entered in the office of the clerk of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court for the third judicial department, making the order of the Court of
Appeals the order of the Appellate Division and remanding the matter to the
Appeal Board for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of the

existence of such a union rule did not warrant the conclusion that claimant was
excused from continuing his employment. The referee and the Appeal Board had to
go further and determine whether, under all the facts of the case, the claimant
was justified in complying with the union regulation. Such an inquiry would
involve a decision as to the reasonableness of the regulation in question -
whether, in other words, the nature of the industry, the state of the labor
market and other relevant considerations, furnished reasonable basis in fact
for that regulation. To hold otherwise would be to allow the union to determine
arbitrarily what constituted &quot;good cause&quot; for the claimant's leaving

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The employer is a steamship corporation,
wholly owned by a steel company. It operates eight cargo vessels that make
inter-coastal voyages, carrying steel on its westbound and lumber on its
eastbound voyages. In 1948 the employer entered into contractual relations with
a seafarers' union, which it recognized as the exclusive representative of the
unlicensed personnel employed on all its vessels for the purpose of collective
bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of work and other
conditions of employment. The agreement contained no closed shop or
preferential hiring provision. Although the employer was free to hire crewmen to
man its vessels as it pleased, admittedly, in practice it customarily hired
substantially all of its unlicensed seamen through the union's hiring hall. We
reiterate the following findings of fact, substantially as made by the referee,
which findings we previously had adopted as the findings of fact of this Board
in Appeal Board 23,454-50 and adopt such findings as findings of the Board in
the instant case. From October 7 to December 19, 1949, claimant, a seaman, was
employed as a messman aboard on one of the employer's vessels which made a
round trip from New York to Seattle, Washington, and returned during that
period. All of the replacement to complete the crew of that vessel, including
claimant, came from the union's hiring hall. The claimant had previously
applied for membership in the union, but was not admitted to full membership
(hereinafter called book membership), as the union was then temporarily not
accepting additional applications for book membership. Instead, claimant was
given a permit card by the union. As a permit man he may bid for a job if no
book member has applied for it and may remain in employment for a period of 60
days for the duration of one round trip, whichever is longer. Although he may
not vote at membership meetings, a permit man has all the other duties and
benefits of full union membership. At the termination of the voyage on December
19, 1949, claimant was instructed by a union representative to leave the vessel
since he had been employed for more than 60 days. Failure to obey the
instructions of the union representative would have subjected him to
disciplinary action by the union, and would have precluded him from becoming a
full book member of the union at any time. The hearing held before the Board in
compliance with the provisions of the decision of the court of appeals and the
order of the Courts, established the following facts: The union, in which
claimant held membership as a permit man, is a trade union of unlicensed
seamen. It was organized in 1938 as an international union and is affiliated
with the American Federation of Labor. The union's Atlantic division has
jurisdiction over its members in the Port of New York. The union is in
contractual relations with about 95 employers of unlicensed seamen, engaged in
the operation of vessels that make both foreign and inter-coastal voyages.
Pursuant to the contract entered into with the various employers, including the
employer in this case, the union agreed to furnish seamen to the employers, as
needed, to man their vessels. In fulfillment of its contractual obligation, the
union maintains hiring halls, employing a rotary system of job referrals. It
gives job priority to its book members over its permit members. Within each
class of membership, preference is given to those members with the earliest
chronological registration for employment. It endeavors at all times to
maintain an adequate reserve pool of its members available for referral to
employers upon request. The union's hiring halls with their respective labor
pools operate at key ports, including the Port of New York. The union members
constituting the various pools of unemployed seamen are available for referral
to employment to other ports whenever a shortage of seamen develops in a
particular geographical area. Employment in the maritime industry is not
steady, and there are many periods of unemployment to which seamen are
subjected. The average seaman, if more or less steadily employed, works about
eight months out of the year. The employment of unlicensed seamen in the
industry is directly dependent on the number of vessels actively engaged in
commerce among our domestic ports and between ports and those in foreign
nations. The withdrawal of vessels from active operations results in an
increase in unemployment equal to the number of jobs filled by crews previously
engaged in the operations of the &quot;laid-up&quot; vessels. In normal times
there are seasonal fluctuations both in the number of vessels in operation and
the number of seamen employed. These periods of irregularity in employment
arise out of the season needs for additional cargo space for the articles of
commerce being hauled, such as coal for stock piling or grain and other
agricultural products for foreign ports. With the close of a season, employment
shrinks as extra cargo space aboard vessels is withdrawn and the seamen
employed during the seasonal periods become excess and unemployed. In addition
to unemployment due to normal seasonal variations, other factors influence the
stability of employment in the maritime industry. Job opportunities fluctuate
with periods of international crises, war, post-war readjustment and the
fulfillment of governmental aid programs for the benefit of foreign nations. In
1938, vessels of American Registry of 1,000 tons or more provided 49,800
licensed and unlicensed jobs for seamen. Most of these were jobs for unlicensed
seamen. With the increase of international tensions in Europe, followed by war,
more vessels were continuously put into operation and the employment of men to
man these vessels increased, so that at its peak in September 1945, there were
168,070 seamen employed in the maritime industry. Thereafter and during the
post-war period, employment in the maritime decreased as vessels were withdrawn
from service so that in July 1950 only 58,650 jobs were available. The Korean
action brought vessels back from reserve fleets and employment in the industry
again rose, so that by December 1951, there were 97,688 jobs filled by seamen.
Every seaman has been required since 1950, in furtherance of the national
security, to have his seamen's papers validated by the United States Coast
Guard. Out of a total of 359,589 validated documents since September 1950,
307,571 were actually issued and are in the possession of men qualified to take
employment as seamen. However, at the time of the hearing held before the Board
there were only 71,900 job opportunities for seamen in the maritime industry, a
ratio of better than four qualified seamen for every available job. When
claimant's union was organized in 1938, the seamen then employed aboard vessels
operated by the employers who entered into collective bargaining agreements
were offered book membership in the union. Thereafter, as employers' fleets
were organized, the employed seamen were permitted to join the union as book
members. Each book member brought with him his job so that the number of union
book members approximated the number of jobs under contract with the union. By
1940, events in Europe caused an increased demand for ships and seamen to man
them. The union's hiring halls were open to all who qualified and sought
employment as seamen and the union continued to fill the unprecedented number
of job orders received form employers for crews. The impact of the sudden
influx of men, between 1940 and 1945, most of whom, but for their desire to aid
the war effort, did not intend to remain seamen permanently, compelled the
national unions in the maritime industry in 1940 to adopt the trip-card system
of union affiliation, designed to absorb the temporary workers into the
industry. The book members of the union, in order to preserve for themselves
their future rights to job priority by virtue of their union seniority, limited
the membership status of the new seamen. Under the trip-card system, every
seaman who registered for and was referred to employment by the union, except
book members, was given a trip-card. This card permitted the non-book member to
work aboard a vessel for one complete voyage regardless of its duration. The
trip-card expired with the completion of the voyage of the vessel. If the
seaman again sought a referral to employment through the union's hiring hall,
he was required to re-register for employment. Separate shipping list registers
were maintained for book members and trip-card members. The latter were given
job referrals and new trip-cards only after no book members were available for
referral. In that way book members had first choice of the available jobs. In
the latter part of 1945, the union membership abolished the trip-card system
and in its stead adopted a permit class of membership and the 60-day rule,
designed to take care of job requirements that could not be filled by the
regular book members. This new practice was incorporated into and made part of
the union's published rules regulating the union membership in registering for
employment and shipping. A violation of these rules subjected the union members
to disciplinary action by the union, and for a violation of the 60-day rule, a
permit member was subject to the loss of his union membership. A seaman
applicant for union membership was given a permit membership (as distinguished
from a book membership) only if a job opening was available to which he might
be referred. But once issued, the member continued to hold the permit as long
as he desired to continue his union membership, abided by the rules and
regulations of the union and properly performed the duties of his job while
employed aboard an employer's vessel. Like book members and the former class of
trip-card holders, the permit member registers for employment at the union's
hiring hall. Separate shipping lists are maintained for each class of member,
with book members having priority in receiving referrals to employment over
permit men of the same job classification. If there is no book member available
for referral, the earliest registered permit man is given the job. Once on the
job, the permit man is entitled to remain in his employment for a minimum
period of 60 days, or one round trip of the vessel, whichever is the longer.
Having worked for at least 60 days or more, the permit man must then leave the
vessel and re-register at the hiring hall so as to afford an unemployed book
member an opportunity to obtain employment. A permit man who fails to leave the
vessel when directed by a union official is subject to loss of his union
membership. The union's policy to keep the number of its book members equal to
the number of jobs it serves under its contracts with employers, is calculated
to afford the book member, who has established himself as a career seaman, in
steady employment. In implementation of this policy, the union membership voted
to close its books for new book members in November 1947, except during periods
of organizational drives when non-union employers are organized and their
employees, upon becoming book members, bring with them their jobs. Up until
that time, permit men were able to qualify for book membership upon organizing
a non-union crew. A migratory nature of the work in the industry keeps seamen
away from their families for long periods of time. Some book members take time
off from their employment in accordance with their scheduled vacation periods,
while others, after extended voyages, may withdraw from the labor market for
short periods to spend time ashore with their families. Frequently men are
unable to work for other reasons including illness. Consequently, in order to
temporarily fill the jobs held by book members, permit members are referred as
relief men and substitutes. This class of membership during normal times
constitutes a reserve pool drawn against by the union to fill the jobs of its
regular book members. During periods of seasonal fluctuations and emergencies
the permit men fill jobs that may be in excess of the union's book members. In
its operation the permit system and 60-day rule assures the career seaman of
job security by virtue of his seniority in the union and industry, tending to
stabilize his employment. Practically all other maritime unions in the industry
long have operated under similar permit systems, designed to develop reserves
of seamen during periods of increased employment opportunities and to protect
the job security and seniority of their career seamen membership during periods
of job shortages. The 60-day rule and permit system of membership in claimant's
union is not intended to provide a share-the-work-plan. The union established a
method designed to regulate fluctuating periods of employment and unemployment
in a highly unionized industry so as to provide more steady employment to the
hard core of its membership of career seamen. In the light of the problems
faced by the union, the universal method it adopted to solve them, by the
enactment of the 60-day rule and permit class of membership, cannot be said to
have been unreasonable. The union has found from its experience that the permit
system and 60-day rule is workable and beneficial to the maritime industry as a
whole and to the career seamen serving that industry. We find that the
regulation of the union was a reasonable one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer for approximately 10 years. He was engaged in the capacity of factory
foreman. In January, 1950, claimant was temporarily laid off due to the fact
that a faulty memory affected the quality of his work. However, claimant was
subsequently rehired by his employer. During the course of his employment the
claimant had given evidence of mental lapses on several other occasions.
Effective February 26, 1951, claimant refiled for benefits indicating that his
last day of employment was February 23, 1951. The cause of his loss of
employment was given as lack of work. On March 7, 1951, claimant became
re-employed and worked continuously thereafter through April 12, 1951. When
refiling for benefits on April 13, 1951, claimant's identification booklet was
marked to indicate employment on March 5, 6 and 7, 1951, and total unemployment
from March 8, 1951 through March 18, 1951. Actually, claimant was unemployed on
March 5 and 6, 1951. When appearing at the local office on April 13, 1951 for
the purpose of refiling his claim for benefits, claimant was informed by a
member of the local office staff that he was entitled to receive a benefit
check for the statutory week ending March 18, 1951. He was thereupon given a
certification form and told to certify to a week of total unemployment for the
week ending March 18, 1951. Claimant received a benefit check in the sum of $26
for said week. Subsequently, claimant was informed by the local office that he
was not totally unemployed during the week in question and had been overpaid
$26 in benefits. He consulted his employer's bookkeeper, was informed by her that
he had incorrectly marked his identification booklet and that, in fact, he had
been employed for the entire week ending March 18, 1951. Immediately thereafter
claimant returned the proceeds of the benefit check which he had erroneously
received. Thereupon, the local office issued an initial determination holding
that claimant made a wilful misrepresentation on April 13, 1951 in order to
obtain benefits. Claimant was charged with an overpayment of $26 in benefits
and a forfeiture of 24 effective days was imposed against his future benefit
right. Claimant requested a hearing and the referee sustained the initial
determination of the local office. Claimant, thereupon, appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in sustaining the initial
determination of the local office, concluded that claimant wilfully
misrepresented with respect to total unemployment and that such
misrepresentation was not due to an incorrect error. We are not in accord with
the referee's disposition of this case. The record contains ample evidence to
support claimant's contention that he was honestly mistaken when he marked his
identification booklet to indicate that he was totally unemployed for the
statutory week ending March 18, 1951. It appears that he had previous lapses in
memory to a degree sufficient to cause his employer to lay him off for
temporary periods. Claimant indicate in his booklet that he was employed on
March 5 and 6, 1951, whereas, in fact, he was unemployed on those days, a clear
indication of a confused mind. Furthermore, when claimant reported at the local
office on April 13, 1951, he did so for the purpose of refiling his claim for
current benefits, since he was then again unemployed. He had no intention of
claiming benefits for the week ending March 18, 1951 and would not have
executed the certification from had not the local office employee advised
claimant that he was entitled to receive a benefit check for the statutory week
in question. These factors, plus his advance age, compel the conclusion that claimant
inadvertently furnished misinformation under the mistaken impression that the
same was correct. In arriving at our conclusion, we are not unmindful of the
decision in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Bernstein</u>, 303 NY 755, decided by the Court
of Appeals on January 10, 1952, affirming 278 App. Div. 625, which reversed
Appeal Board, 22,265-50. In that case it was conceded that the claimant
knowingly furnished false information to the local office, upon the basis of
which he received benefits. The Appellate Division clearly indicated in a
memorandum opinion that Section 594 of the Labor Law does not require criminal
intent or proof sufficient to support a larceny. It merely stated that
administrative officials were entitled to be informed of true facts upon which
to make a determination and that if a claimant knowingly certifies to a false
fact the statute authorizes a forfeiture of benefit rights. The instant case is
distinguishable from the&nbsp;<u>Bernstein</u>&nbsp;case (supra) in that the
claimant herein did not knowingly furnish misinformation but instead honestly
believed the representations he made were factually true. A further extenuating
circumstance is the fact that despite the incorrect information contained in
claimant's identification booklet, it was not his intention to claim benefits
for the statutory week in issue. He certified to such week only when advised to
do so by a member of the local office staff. Immediately upon realizing that an
error had been committed, claimant voluntarily returned the proceeds of the
benefit check to which he was not entitled. Upon all the facts and
circumstances herein, we are persuaded that claimant did not make a wilful
misrepresentation in order to obtain benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cited by the referee in his opinion is distinguishable. In that case the
claimant had arranged for employment in the place of her new residence prior to

worked for three years ending January 12, 1951 as a clerk-typist for an export
textile firm. She was laid off due to poor business conditions. At the date of
her separation, she was pregnant. Claimant filed an original claim for benefits
on January l5, 1951 and reported to April 15, 1951. Her child was born on April
19, 1951. She filed an additional claim on May 21, 1951. Claimant’s mother, who
is 40 years old, resides in Brooklyn. She prepares her husband’s meals and
attends to the household. Claimant’s father arrives home from work about 7:00
p.m. In the event claimant obtained employment, she asserted, her mother would
come to her (claimant’s) home in the Elmhurst Section of Queens at 8:00 a.m.
each day and stay there until 5:00 or 5:30 p.m. to take care of the child. The
travel time from the mother's residence to claimant's home is approximately one
hour each way. At the beginning of her unemployment period following the filing
of her additional claim, claimant restricted herself to a salary of $50 a week.
Export clerks earn from $50 to $60 a week. Because her experience is in the
export trade, she expressed a preference for work in this line. She was
however, allegedly willing to accept work in any industry. At the hearing on
July 5, 1951, she stated she was willing to work for $45 a week. Claimant, in
order to obtain work, allegedly answered newspaper advertisements and inquired
of friends employed In the export industry. She was interviewed by two
prospective employers but was not hired allegedly because she did not qualify
for the job openings. She contacted several other employers who informed her,
she alleged, that the jobs for which she applied were already filled. By
communication dated January 22, 1952, claimant advised the Board that she had
been continuously unemployed since the filing of her claim and conceded that as
of the last quarter of 1951 she withdrew from the labor market. The local
office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits, effective May 21, 1951, on the ground that she had withdrawn from the
labor market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The Referee overruled the determination on the
theory that claimant's salary requirements were not unreasonable, that
claimant’s testimony regarding the ability of her mother to care for her child
was not impugned and that claimant had made diligent efforts to find work. The
Industrial Commissioner contends that in view of the tender age of claimant’s
child and the improbability that her mother would travel to claimant’s
residence each day to take care of the child, claimant’s genuine attachment to
the labor market is highly questionable. A careful evaluation of the entire
record in this case leads to the conclusion that the Industrial Commissioner’s
position is well taken. At the time claimant refiled her claim on May 21, 1951,
her child was one month old. She stated her mother would travel to her home
each morning, remain during the day and return at night. This would require the
mother to leave her home not later than 7:30 a.m., travel an hour, and return
in the evening at 7:00 or 7:30 p.m. Before she would leave home in the morning
she would be required to prepare breakfast for her husband, and after she
returned home at night, to prepare supper and perform other household duties in
tbe meantime. It seems incredible thalt such an arrangement was ever made.
Claimant’s attitude toward one job which she alleged was offered to her, and
which she did not accept, lends great support to our overall conclusion in this
case. She testified she told the prospective employer that she did not believe
she qualified for the job that he indicated he was willing to hire her, and
told her &quot;it was up to her&quot; whether or not she would take the job.
Furthermore, it is not reasonable to believe that claimant would have remained
unemployed over the long period herein, in spite of the fact that there has
been an unusual demand for clerk-typists, if she were genuinely interested in
taking work. Under all the circumstances in this case, we reach the conclusion
that claimant had withdrawn from the labor market at the date she filed her
claim on May 21, 1951.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

order checker in the mail order department of a large retail establishment. He
was discharged on October 20, 1950, together with two other co-workers for
failure to report to the employer the theft of two guns by a co-worker.
Claimant filed a claim for benefits and registered for employment on October
23, 1950. The local office issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving any benefits for 42 days, on the ground that he lost
his employment through misconduct in connection therewith. Claimant protested
and requested a hearing before a referee. Claimant did not appear at the
hearing. At an interview in the local office on November 6, 1950, claimant
signed a statement which contains the following language: &quot;I did know
about the theft, but had nothing to do with it. I would not squeal on anyone
even though I was aware of what he had done.&quot; The referee overruled the
initial determination. The Industrial Commissioner and the employer appealed to
the Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

statement that he &quot;would not squeal on anyone even though he was aware of

constitute misconduct within the meaning of Section 592.2 of the Unemployment

"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant was employed for two years ending
June 20, 1951 as an attendant in a launderette located near her residence in
Manhattan, where she lived with her husband and seven-year-old daughter.
Claimant's duties consisted of supervising the use of 30 automatic washing
machines by customers who came to the employer's establishment to do their
laundry. Claimant instructed new users in the proper operation of the machine,
provided coins in suitable denominations for use therewith and kept the floor
of the premises free of soapy water. Although the establishment was open six
days a week from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily, claimant's hours of work were
from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., with one-half hour for dinner. Her salary was $35
a week. In June 1951, claimant requested a leave of absence and left New York
in order to join her husband, who had been ordered into active military service
with the armed forces and was then stationed in Tampa, Florida. On September 8,
1951, claimant returned to New York and promptly sought reinstatement with her
employer, but was not rehired. Meanwhile, claimant took up her residence at her
apartment, where she provides a home and cares for her daughter who attends a
neighborhood school. Claimant's mother-in-law is employed but is at home daily
shortly after 5:00 p.m. Claimant's young daughter requires attention up until
8:30 a.m. daily, when claimant leaves her at school. Between 3:00 p.m. and 5:30
p.m. claimant must again be available to care for her child. Claimant's
mother-in-law is free to look after her granddaughter every evening. Claimant
desired employment and was willing to work either on a five or six days a week
basis. Because of her obligations to her child, claimant was compelled to seek
employment with working hours from 9:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6:00 p.m. to
midnight or on a single night at any time after 6:00 p.m. She was willing to
work a split shift, provided the hours of employment fell within the periods of
her availability for work. Claimant actively searched for work. She was willing
to accept any employment for which she was fitted. Based on her prior
experience and work history, in addition to being a launderette attendant for
two years, claimant had formerly worked as a bookkeeper and is capable of
handling accounts receivable and payable. She also had some experience as a
part-time sales clerk with a large chain of variety stores and was willing to
again accept employment as such. She is capable of working as a cashier and
would accept such employment. On her own initiative, claimant unsuccessfully
canvassed several retail shops and a department store in her neighborhood
seeking employment as a sales clerk. She followed newspaper advertisements for
part-time job openings. She sought assistance from her parish priest and
friends in her quest for a job. Following their leads, claimant endeavored to
obtain employment with a large life insurance company employment (sic) women on
a part-time basis from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and with a public utility company
employing women on a night shift and a split shift basis. Claimant filed an
original claim for benefits and registered for employment on September 17,
1951. The employment office did not maintain her registration on file, but
claimant's reporting booklet indicates the nature of her last employment.
Claimant regularly reported to the employment service as required, but was
never referred to any possible job opening. Although job openings for
claimant's requested part-time or split shift hours were limited during the
period of her reporting, it is conceded that launderettes in Manhattan did then
employ attendants at hours that deviated from the normal hours of a business
day. In addition to full-time work from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., launderette
attendants were employed as split shift workers from 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon and
then from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Some establishments employed attendants on a
part-time basis, hours from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., five evenings a week and
all day Saturday. Based on interviews held at the local office, during the course
of which claimant fairly stated her work history, and the reason for
restricting her employability to the hours she specified, an initial
determination was issued holding that because of her family duties, claimant
was unavailable for employment, effective as of the day on which she filed her
claim for benefits. Claimant's need for employment and willingness to work was
not disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole issue in this case is whether or not
claimant was available for employment on and after the date of her original
filing for benefits. Claimant's sincerity and her desire for and readiness to
work during the hours she specified, because of her domestic circumstances, are
not questioned. The referee nevertheless concluded that she was unavailable for
employment because she was unable &quot;to accept employment within the usual
hours expected by prospective employers.&quot; His conclusion disregards
claimant's prior work history and the fact, as testified to by the employment
service representative, that launderettes employed attendants during the hours
requested by the claimant. The limitation on her working hours as set forth by
the claimant is neither arbitrary nor capricious on her part. Claimant's
parental obligation to her seven-year-old daughter we deem to be of prime
importance and constitutes a compelling circumstance justifying her restriction
(Appeal Board, 8271-42). The record discloses that launderette attendants were
employed on a split shift basis at hours that conformed with the hours of employment
sought by the claimant without restriction as to the nature of the work. Other
establishments employed persons from 9:00 a.m. t to 2:00 p.m. at skills for
which claimant might qualify. We believe that claimant was not restricting her
working hours to unobtainable periods of employment and that there was a market
for her services, to which she was exposed not only by her own efforts in
seeking employment but by her registration at the employment service. Although
ready, willing and able to accept employment, claimant nevertheless continued
to be unemployed only because of the lack of an appropriate job vacancy. Under
such circumstances, we hold claimant to have satisfied the availability
requirements of our law. The test is the availability of the claimant for work
and not the availability of work for the claimant (Appeal Board
12,626-46;17,200-48).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reported because claimant was held available in spite of severe limitations
regarding acceptable working hours. This and other cases show that the degree
of a limitation which can be allowed without resulting in a finding of
unavailability, will often depend on the circumstances of the case. The more
compelling the reasons for the restrictions are, the narrower may be the field
of jobs which claimant must be ready, willing and able to accept. A different
decision might have been reached in the case here reported, under otherwise
identical circumstances, if claimant's reasons would have been less strong and
less compelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a porter, was employed at his
customary occupation until December 3, 1950 when he voluntarily left his job
because he no longer was physically able to perform the duties required of him.
On December 11, 1950, he filed for benefits and registered for employment.
Claimant visited a physician on January 15, 1951 at which time he complained of
varicose veins. The physician discovered that claimant was suffering from a
serious malignant condition in addition to varicosity. The physician
recommended immediate hospitalization and surgery. He also indicated that, from
a medical viewpoint, claimant was totally disabled and incapable of performing
any work at least as of January 5, 1951. On February 13, 1951, claimant was
admitted to a hospital for surgical treatment. He was continuously confined
thereafter until March 14, 1951. A claim for disability benefits was filed with
the Workmen's Compensation Board of the State of New York on April 10, 1951. On
the notice and proof of claim for disability benefits, claimant stated that the
first full day upon which he was unable to work because of his claimed
disability, was January 5, 1951. As a result of filing such claim he received
disability benefits for the period January 5, 1951 through February 11, 1951.
Claimant had reported at his local unemployment insurance office and certified
to total unemployment for the same period. On the basis of such certification,
he received $138 in unemployment insurance benefits for the six-week period
from January 5, 1951 through February 11, 1951. Subsequently this sum was
recouped by the State by way of setoff. Based upon information furnished by the
Workmen's Compensation Board, the local office issued an initial determination
holding claimant ineligible for benefits for the period January 5, 1951 through
February 11, 1951 on the ground that he was incapable of employment. Claimant
requested a hearing and the referee overruled the initial determination. The
Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee concluded that claimant was
available for and capable of employment during the period in issue since his
capability was substantiated by a medical report. We are not in accord with the
conclusion reached by the referee. It appears from the evidence now before us
that claimant had not filed for disability benefits before entering a hospital
for surgery. Consequently his receipt of unemployment insurance benefits was
not open to question by local office personnel at that time. However, upon
being discharged from the hospital claimant filed a claim for disability
benefits retroactive to the period January 5, 1951 through February 11, 1951.
Such benefits were paid only upon adequate proof that claimant was totally
disabled within the meaning of the Disability Benefits Law during the period
for which claim was made (Disability Benefits Law, Section 201). Since claimant
proved his total disability for the period in issue by adequate medical
evidence it follows that he must have been incapable of employment. Under such
circumstances, he was ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits for same
period since he did not meet the capability requirements of the statute
(Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 522). A claimant may not be the recipient
of unemployment insurance benefits and disability benefits for the same period
since such benefits are mutually exclusive (Disability Benefits Law Section
206.1(c)). Where a claimant is totally disabled, thus entitling him to receive
disability benefits by reason thereof, he is deemed incapable of employment and
ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. On the other hand, if a claimant should be deemed
physically capable of employment, he does not meet the total incapacity
requirement entitling him to disability benefits (Disability Benefits Law,
Section 207.1). Upon all the facts and circumstances herein, we are convinced
that claimant was incapable of employment during the period in issue.
Consequently, he was ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits for that
period. However, since the amount of the overpayment was subsequently offset,
claimant is not deemed to have been overpaid in benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of his reporting. It was not the intent of the Legislature to hold that
drilling a few hours one evening a week as a member of the National or State
Guard should be ruled to be employment. This case differs from Appeal Board,
2387-40, where the claimant was required to go to a military camp for a period
of two weeks for which he was paid a substantial salary. The initial
determination is overruled. (May 27, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employment has been as a clerk. Since 1946, he has worked as a tax assessor for
the village of Hudson Falls by appointment, at a salary of $500 per annum. His
duties required him to appraise real estate assigned to him for tax purposes
commencing with the second week in September. Thereafter, he prepared a tax
roll for the village clerk and filed such rolls by the third week in October.
He then was required to be present at grievance hearings on grievance days. He
usually was paid his salary in a lump sum on grievance day. He could not state
whether or not he would be subject to call to discuss any tax problem which
might arise because he had never been called in the four years in which he
acted as tax assessor. During 1950, claimant received his payments prior to
grievance day. During the entire period in issue, claimant sought employment in
his regular occupation as fruit and vegetable clerk. His base year earnings
were in that capacity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee ruled that claimant, although he
performed no services beyond grievance day throughout the period of his
employment as tax assessor, was not totally unemployed because the salary he
received covers an entire year's work and such work may be performed at any
time during the year. After a careful examination of the evidence and of the
statutes applicable to the duties of claimant's office, we cannot agree with
the conclusion reached by the referee. Section 104 of the Village Law provides
that the tax rolls are to be filled on or before November 1 or each year.
Section 105 fixes grievance day as the third Tuesday in November; but hearings
on grievances may be adjourned to no later than December 15. Village assessors
are required to be present at the hearing of grievances. Section 106 requires
that the village tax roll be competed and verified and filed with the village
clerk on or before the first day of January. Section 109-A specifies the
instances in which corrections of errors and omissions in the assessment rolls
may be made by boards of trustees and fixes the duties of village assessors in
such cases. Under this section, the board of trustees may require the assessor
to re-assess property for the amended tax roll. As the referee pointed out,
claimant's responsibility as a village assessor continued beyond grievance day.
It appears, however, that this last official act in any fiscal year must occur
on or before the last day of the year since the tax roll must be completed, verified
an filed no later than January 1 of the following year. It appears further that
thereafter the sole method of review is by certiorari. The record is clear that
claimant's duties were customarily performed and completed between the second
week of September and grievance day of each year. It is equally clear that in
any event claimant could not be called upon to perform the duties of his office
after December 31 of any year. We find no legal or factual basis for the
referee's holding that claimant's work as an assessor may be performed at any
time during the year. We have held that a public official may not be considered
totally unemployed where the duties of his office are continuous and he may be
required to perform them at any time during the year. This element is not
present in the case before us. The record herein shows that it was contemplated
that claimant's services as a tax assessor would be performed between September
and the end of the current tax year and there is no evidence of the need for or
requirement of his services during the remainder of the year. We accordingly
hold that claimant was totally unemployed on and after January 1, 1951 and
entitled to the benefits received during his reporting period following such
date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
