<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'>This
introduction is revised due to amendments to Section 592 effective September
25, 2008. The statute no longer provides for a suspension from benefits for
workers unemployed due to a lockout. As amended, the statute states that if a
claimant “</span>lost his or her&nbsp;employment because of a strike,&nbsp;or
other industrial controversy except for lockouts, including concerted activity
not authorized or sanctioned by the recognized or certified bargaining agent of
the claimant, and other concerted activity conducted in violation of any
existing collective bargaining agreement, in the establishment in which he or
she&nbsp;was employed..<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Courier New"'>”, the accumulation of benefit rights is to be suspended for a
period of seven consecutive weeks beginning with the day after such loss of
employment. Such a suspension applies even if the claimant has intervening
employment before filing a claim. Once a suspension is applied it is not
terminated by any employment obtained after the filing of a claim. If the
industrial controversy terminates before the expiration of the seven-week
suspension period, benefit rights may be accumulated beginning with the day
after the termination of such industrial controversy. No waiting period may be
served during this suspension period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'>The
amended statute also includes new provisions regarding the hiring of
replacement workers by an employer during a strike. The suspension from
benefits “…shall not apply upon the hiring of a permanent replacement worker
for the employee’s position by the employer”. In addition, the statute states:
“</span><span style='color:black'>A replacement worker shall be presumed to be
permanent unless the employer certifies in writing that the employee will be
able to return to his or her prior position upon conclusion of the strike, in
the event the strike terminates prior to the conclusion of the employee's
eligibility for benefit rights under this chapter.&nbsp; In the event the
employer does not&nbsp;permit such return after such certification, the
employee shall be entitled to recover with interest any benefits lost as a
result of the seven week suspension of benefits, and the department may impose
a penalty upon the employer of up to seven hundred fifty dollars per employee
per week&nbsp;of benefits lost.”</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
