licensed attorney in the State of New York, worked as a municipal executive
from January 2008 until May 15, 2012 when she lost her employment in September
2012 under circumstances not at issue. Since 2008 she ended her activities for
her private law practice which was based in her home. She did not keep a legal
calendar for that period. She did not deduct anything from the law firm on her
personal income taxes in 2010, 2011 or 2012. She was listed in official
publications as an attorney specializing in municipal planning. </span></p>

filed an original claim for benefits online. While receiving benefits, she
continued to provide free legal services for two churches she had dealt with in
her former city executive capacity. The first church, represented by its own
counsel, was scheduled for demolition. The claimant gave assistance on how to
use the media to try to halt this. She addressed the municipal zoning board of
appeals. She made telephone calls, created e-mails and produced some legal
documents for a dispute involving sale of the church s property. The second
church was scheduled to be closed by its religious authority. The claimant
assisted members of the congregation to articulate and publicize their
opposition to this decision. She counseled a long-time, former real estate
client, to reduce the asking price to facilitate the sale of his business. She
advised an energy entrepreneur trying to open an energy company. Had he
succeeded, the claimant may have been hired as a corporate official, not as an
attorney. She counseled a long-time female friend who did not have the
resources to hire an attorney for her post-divorce, domestic abuse problems.
This person was not yet ready to take legal action. The claimant did not
receive remuneration for these efforts. On average, she spent an hour or less
on these matters for two days a week. She spent several hours on days when she
was drawing up legal paperwork for the churches. During the benefit period, she
checked two e-mails addresses for her law firm twice a week. She handed out
business cards with her contact information in order to generate the
possibility for new business. She did not advertise her legal services. Her pro
bono efforts did not produce new business for the law firm because of the
impact of the circumstances of her separation from her last employment. She
continued to seek work as a municipal official without success. During the
benefit period the claimant had three illnesses that reduced her activity
level. As of January 2014, the legal matters she was involved in were no longer
active and remained incomplete. The claimant acknowledged that on the following
days she provided pro bono legal services to the foregoing entities and
individuals: October 27, November 7, November 19, November 20, November 26,
December 4, December 14, December 28 of 2012; January 4, January 8, January 18,
January 28, February 4, February 26, March 6, March 11, March 14, March 18,
March 19, March 20, March 26 and April 3 of 2013.</span></p>

for benefits, the claimant accessed, printed and read the <i>Claimant
Information Handbook </i>(hereinafter <i>Handbook</i>). On page 9, she read the
section entitled, <i> What is considered work </i> which stated,  You must
report all the work that you perform whether it is for yourself, a friend, a
relative, an employer, or in connection with a public office that you hold. Any
activity that brings in or may bring in income at any time must be reported.
You are considered employed on any day when you perform any services, even an
hour or less, in self-employment, on a freelance basis, or for someone else. It
makes no difference whether this work is in covered employment or whether you
get paid for that day .  On page 10, she read the section entitled, <i> What if
I do volunteer work? </i> which stated,  You may be eligible for unemployment
insurance benefits while volunteering, providing the volunteer work meets the
following criteria: volunteer work is for a charitable, or religious, or
special organization and you do not receive payment in any form for your
volunteer work; if the volunteer work is not a precondition to being hired or
rehired into a paid position; and your volunteer duties do not interfere with
your ability to search for work and do not affect or limit the number of days
and hours you are going to work. You may be considered employed on any day or
any part of a day when you perform even minor duties or favors for a friend or
relative s business whether you get paid or not. You should call the TCC
[Telephone Claims Center] and give all details before claiming benefits.  In November
2012, the claimant spoke to a Department of Labor representative in the
Division of Employment Services office in Troy, New York (hereinafter DOES)
about her certification situation. She was concerned about the effect of the
advice she provided to her friend, the energy entrepreneur on her eligibility.
The claimant did not expect to be hired by him until the fall of 2013. The
claimant was advised that the possibility of work for any company she may have
formed was so remote that her services for him would not be considered work for
unemployment insurance purposes. She was not verbally advised to call the TCC
for information on certification for benefits. She did not expect and was not
paid for her pro bono work. For each week during her benefit period, the
claimant certified to having done no work in reliance on the criteria
articulated in the section entitled,  What if I do volunteer work?  <b> </b>As
a result of her weekly certifications, she received $9,315 in regular
unemployment insurance benefits.<b> </b></span></p>

claimant s application to reopen A.L.J. Case Nos. 113-09973 and 113-06042 has

cause not to proceed in the prior hearings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%'>            The credible evidence establishes
that during the claimant s benefit period, starting on October 15, 2012 through
April 29, 2013, the claimant provided occasional free legal services to
individuals and religious organizations. We disagree with the Judge s
conclusion that the claimant should have known from the written advice in the <i>Handbook
</i>under the section <i> What is considered work?  </i>that her occasional pro
bono activities constituted work for unemployment insurance purposes simply
because she had an extant though inactive law firm. We find that the claimant s
activities fall squarely within the guidelines described in the section <i> What
if I do volunteer work?  </i> Although she handed out her business cards with
contact information during these pro bono activities and checked e-mails,
neither the cards nor her free services enhanced her ability to generate new
business on behalf of her defunct law firm. Significantly, she did not
advertise on behalf of the law firm. She made no court appearances. She earned
no money. She also continued her search for work in her chosen field of
municipal service. This set of facts stands in contrast with those in <i>Matter
of Moreira-Brown </i>(36 AD3d 987). That attorney was in the start-up phase of
a law firm and expended substantial efforts to acquire legal work. Notably,
none of his activities involved rendering free legal services. In the case now
before us, we have an inactive law firm which has not generated any income in
years since 2008. The Court in <i>Matter of Haseltine</i>, 30 AD3d 938, held
that a claimant who ceased operating her construction business, stopped
performing services because she was working for her employer and had only not
terminated the certificate of doing business was held not to stand to gain
financially from her defunct business. There was no evidence that she performed
substantial activities on behalf of that business while collecting benefits.
The same applies to the instant case where the claimant handed out her business
card while performing pro bono work but had no success getting any business for
her defunct law firm while looking for work as a municipal executive without
success. The claimant s free legal activities did not resurrect her law firm as
an active, functioning law practice capable of growing and providing an income.
As there was no ongoing business, we further conclude that the claimant did not
stand to gain financially from her law firm (Compare <i>Matter of Restivo</i>,
24 AD3d 1007 wherein that claimant performed minimal activities for an ongoing
business and was held to lack total unemployment). Finally, we also note that
as an ethical matter, attorneys are now encouraged and may be required to
perform such free legal services for individuals and organizations with no
means to pay for them. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%;text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%'>            We recently reconsidered
our prior holdings on the matter of performing volunteer services in the
context of total unemployment while receiving unemployment benefits and looking
for work (See Appeal Board No. 577489). The claimant performed services as a
clerical aide for a hospital during his benefit period. As that claimant
searched for work, got reimbursed $5 for meal expenses and received no pay, the
Board found that his volunteer work did not interfere with his search for work.
The Board cited a case involving an attorney who usually drove cabs for his
living, performed pro bono immigration law work on his laptop while in the
hospital (See Appeal Board No. 554731). We concluded that the performance of
such pro bono work did not affect his total unemployment because it was not in gainful
employment, even if the activity might lead the claimant to become employed at
some future time. We also concluded that it was neither the intention of the
Legislature nor the public policy of this State that unemployment benefits be
denied to claimants who engage in such activity in order to improve their
chances of obtaining employment (See Appeal Board No. 360187). Therefore, under
the facts of this case we conclude that the claimant reasonably interpreted the
<i>Handbook</i> to infer that her pro bono legal services constituted volunteer
work which fell within the stated guidelines. Accordingly, we further conclude
that the claimant was totally unemployed and was eligible to receive the
benefits she received. It follows and we so conclude that there is no
overpayment of benefits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%'>            The credible evidence
further establishes that, based upon the foregoing analysis, the claimant
accurately certified that she performed no work while searching for work,
performing pro bono services and receiving benefits during the period at issue.
We note that the claimant asked about the certification process when she
reported to the DOES office in Troy. Since the claimant read the pertinent
sections in the <i>Handbook</i>, asked for advice at the DOES office,<i> </i>believed
that she met the criteria under the section<i>,  What if I do volunteer work? </i>
while diligently looking for work, her weekly certifications that she did not
work the previous week were accurate. There was no reason why she should have
doubted the advice she received when read in conjunction with the <i>Handbook</i>.<i>
</i>Thus, while the claimant could have called the TCC for advice, there was no
apparent reason under these facts to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that the
claimant did not make willful misrepresentations in order to receive benefits
and that the 204 effective day forfeiture penalty shall not be imposed.</span></p>

Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 16-12,  Payment of Unemployment
Compensation to Individuals who are Volunteering  (April 19, 2012). The purpose

Board decision is consistent with the Appeal Board s decision in AB 577,849. In
that case the Appeal Board held that engaging in volunteer activities, while
actively seeking work, does not mandate a finding of ineligibility due to a
lack of total unemployment even when the volunteer services lead to employment
with the same organization or when the organization reimburses the volunteer
for expenses. </span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

577,849 extends this principle beyond volunteering for charitable and civic
purposes to work activities with for profit and not-for-profit employers as

claimants who engage in volunteer activities may now be, based on this Appeal
Board decision, be totally unemployed, there is still the possibility that they
may not be available for work.  A claimant doing genuine volunteer work who is
willing to reschedule or drop the work should it conflict with regular
employment, and who is free to make  and is making a diligent effort to find
employment is eligible for benefits  (Field Memo, 11-82  Volunteer Work ).
However, if the claimant refuses suitable employment in favor of the volunteer
activities he/she is ineligible for benefits. If the claimant is not actively
searching for work then he/she is not eligible for benefits.</span></p>
