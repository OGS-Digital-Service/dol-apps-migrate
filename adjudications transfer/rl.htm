REVIEW LETTER 2-2009<br>
SEPTEMBER, 2009</p>
<p align="center"><u>CORPORATE OFFICERS</u><u>, </u><u>BUSINESS PRINCIPALS AND LACK OF TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been several years since the division&rsquo;s  last publication on the subject of business principals. This Review Letter will  survey the current state of the case law with respect to total unemployment as  it pertains to corporate officers and other business principals. Concepts  described in prior publications will be reviewed and discussed. It will also  describe the most common fact patterns seen in current claims by such  individuals.</p>
<p>The pertinent prior publications  include: Special Bulletin A-710-39 <u>Self Employment</u> (1957), Field Memo  4-77 <u>Corporate Principals</u> (1977), Field Memo 1-78 <u>Corporate  Principals II</u> (1978), Review Letter 2-94 <u>Entrepreneurs and Total  Unemployment</u> (1994), and Field Memo 1-2003 <u>Web Site Businesses and Lack  of Total Unemployment</u>. In addition, the extensive body of case law  pertaining to these issues is summarized in the Interpretations Service Index  at Sections 1420- Self Employment, and 1430- Corporate Officers. </p>
<p>The resources cited above explain  the issues in general terms, but the focus in these publications is to provide  guidance with respect to fact finding. The focus in this Review Letter will be  on the interpretation of the facts. Applying the proper concepts and rules to  specific factual situations is not always easy. This Review Letter will  re-examine the ideas associated with this issue and relate them to the types of  business principal cases we most often see today. Some of the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; put forth  in prior publications are less straightforward than they seem. For example,  Field Memo 4-77 contains the statement:&nbsp; &ldquo;A  principal of a going corporation is not totally unemployed, even during a  period in which, because of a temporary suspension of operations, he performs  no services and receives no remuneration&rdquo;. This statement might seem to paint  ineligibility with a very broad brush. In reality, it is quite narrow in its  application. It applies only to a &ldquo;going&ldquo;corporation, that is, one whose future  existence is assured. Furthermore, and more selectively, it is applicable only  to a &ldquo;principal&rdquo;, by which is meant one who is actively involved in the  management of the business.</p>
<p>This Review Letter also announces a new policy  with respect to part-time/sideline businesses. One can now incorporate a  business or establish an LLC on-line in about ten minutes for a few hundred dollars.  The internet also enables one to operate a business without much of the  overhead that was once unavoidable. One no longer needs a physical store to  display wares or sell a product. It can all be done on-line. This ability to  reduce start-up costs, coupled with other trends, has helped to create in  recent years a proliferation of small home based businesses. Many of these are  part-time, side-line businesses, started by individuals as a way to supplement  their earnings from full time employment. Thus, the distinction between wage  earners and self employed entrepreneurs is less clear than it once was. <strong>When such an individual with a part-time  business loses his or her full time employment and files a claim, it is  inappropriate to hold him or her ineligible on a continuous basis, provided  that the claimant keeps it as a part-time business and does not upgrade it to  full time.</strong> Such a claimant should instead be held to be ineligible only on  days that he or she performs services, and regardless of whether the business  is a corporation, partnership, LLC or sole-proprietorship.</p>
<strong>Types  of Cases</strong>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A  particular factual element that is evidence of work performed, such as the  writing of business checks, is of greater or lesser significance, depending on  the state of the business when the claim was filed. Furthermore, a line of  inquiry that is pertinent in one case may be of little help in another.  Therefore, it is useful to identify and list the commonly seen types of  Corporate Officer/Business Principal cases. This RL will discuss the following  type of &ldquo;business&rdquo; claims:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Start Up </strong>of a business &ndash; starting or  attempting to start a business at the time of the Original Claim filing or in  the course of the claim.</li>
  <li><strong>On-going Business with variations &ndash; </strong>Spouse&rsquo;s  business; Family Business helper; True Principal; Part-time/Sideline business </li>
  <li><strong>An inactive business</strong> &ndash; the claimant  alleges the business has been inactive for a long time.</li>
  <li><strong>Winding down</strong> of a business &ndash; at what point can a claimant be considered totally unemployed? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Start Up Business</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review Letter 2-94, <u>Entrepreneurs and Total  Unemployment</u> (1994), outlines some of the steps taken by a person starting  a business. Once an individual develops a clear idea for a business, he or she  proceeds to implement it. As the Review Letter explains, implementation may  consist of filing a certificate of doing business or incorporation, hiring an  attorney or accountant, borrowing money and opening a business bank account,  acquiring a space or office and signing a lease, purchasing insurance, ordering  or purchasing equipment or supplies (including stationery), hiring employees,  and actively soliciting customers or offering a product or service for sale.&nbsp; A claimant who takes all of the above steps  is certainly ineligible, but not every business requires them all. &nbsp;Although &nbsp;the very early process of investigating and  deciding what kind of business to start would not cause a claimant to become  ineligible for benefits, concrete actions taken to start a business are a  different matter, especially when accompanied by significant expenditure or the  assumption of significant financial obligation. Fact finding with respect to  such activity should include dates of any steps taken and amounts of money  spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Our inquiry should always clarify the  nature of the business so that we know what further questions to ask and so  that we have a basis for judging the claimant&rsquo;s credibility with respect to the  details.</strong> What product or service does the business intend to sell and how  does it intend to do that? &nbsp;If we  understand the claimant&rsquo;s business our questioning can be tailored to the  claimant&rsquo;s specific situation. Does the business require licenses, permits or  registrations, and if so, how much of an investment in time and money does  their acquisition represent?&nbsp; If the  business is a store then the claimant must find a space or business premises. If  it is a restaurant there must be a space furnished with specific equipment and  renovated in a certain manner. The nature of the business dictates the actions  a claimant must take to open for business. The acquisition of a business  premises, (the purchase of a building or signing of a lease), is often the  action whereby a claimant steps over the line separating eligibility and  ineligibility. This is because a commercial lease is a significant business  contract that usually represents a large financial obligation. The term of a  commercial lease is often ten or fifteen years, or longer. One would not sign  such a lease unless one &lsquo;means business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a  business lacks a business premises it may be because it does not require one.  But it may also be because the business never quite got off the ground. If the  principal of such a business files a claim he or she should not be held  ineligible indefinitely. AB 544567 concerned a claimant who intended to  establish a boat detailing service. He began advertising in the Pennysaver and  local papers and purchased cleaning products. While he made an application for  liability insurance, and had placed a binder on that insurance, the insurance  was never paid for or registered. The business had no employees, no office or  shop, no checking account and never had any customers. As the claimant had some  computer skills he was actively seeking employment in that field. &nbsp;The determination before the Board stated that  claimant was ineligible due to his status as a business principal. The Appeal  Board overruled, finding that the business had never been operational and that  his activities on its behalf had not been substantial. <strong>Because the business was never fully active, it was not an &ldquo;on-going  business&rdquo;.</strong> Therefore, he was not ineligible. Because the business never  became an on-going business, the activity performed by the claimant did not  render him ineligible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>A  business principal in the start up phase might be ineligible on specific days  while performing activities that constitute work.</strong> Such was the case with the  claimant in AB 541654 who began a sheetrock and painting business, then  discontinued that business three months later. Apart from a two day job for the  business&rsquo; sole client, the claimant performed services during the three months  of the business&rsquo; existence on only four days: filing a business certificate  (one day), purchasing insurance (one day), and purchasing supplies on two  separate days. The important difference between this case and AB544567 cited  above is that the claimant herein actually engaged in performing painting  services for a client, whereas the claimant in AB544567 never actually began  the business, or income generating activity, of his business. The Board held  that his limited activity over the course of a few days does not render him  ineligible on a continuous basis, but only on the specific days on which he  performed services.</p>
<p>By contrast, even though a business  may not be very profitable during its early phase, a principal who stands to  gain from the continued operation of the business is ineligible even if his or  her activities during such a phase are minimal. Claimants sometimes feel  justified in claiming benefits during such a period since the business cannot  yet pay them a salary. Nevertheless, the Appeal board and the Courts have  consistently ruled that the receipt of a salary and even the profitability of  the business are not the controlling pertinent factors. Instead, what controls  is whether the claimant performed significant services for an on-going business  from which he or she stands to gain. In AB 543169, the Board pointed out that  the claimant filed a d/b/a, created and later modified a website, then incorporated  a business to develop an alternative diesel fuel. He met with potential  investors, looked for sites for his business, met with banks and his advisors, attended  seminars and purchased equipment on a weekly basis, all while claiming  benefits. The developing business monopolized his time such that he ceased  looking for other employment two months after filing his original claim. He  took substantial tax deductions for business expenses and at the time of the  hearing indicated that he anticipated production within a few months. This  final fact established the on-going nature of the enterprise. The Appeal Board  held him to be continuously ineligible.</p>
<p>In <u>Matter of Restivo</u>,  24 AD3d 1007, the Appellate Division reached the same conclusion in a case with  similar facts. When the claimant became unemployed he began to devote a full  effort to developing his preexisting investigation business. While he drew no  salary in the first seven months, he nevertheless paid business expenses,  solicited clients, purchased supplies, established a business bank account and  credit card, and performed investigative services, all during the benefit  period. The fact that he commenced the investigative services for which the  business was established, coupled with his beginning to draw a salary after  seven months, established that the business was on-going, and that the claimant  stood to gain from the activities performed during the start up phase.</h2>
  In resolving benefit claims  during the start up phase of a business the ongoing nature of the business is  established by facts showing the acquisition of a business premises, the  commencement of potentially income generating activities, (selling or  attempting to sell a product or service), the hiring of employees, or by other  actions or statements that reveal an intention to continue to operate the  business. In the absence of such evidence that the business is on-going a  claimant may not be held indefinitely ineligible. In some cases, as in AB 541654  cited above, where a claimant barely started a business, had one customer, then  discontinued the business, ineligibility applies to individual days.
</p>
<p><strong>On-Going  Business &amp; Variations</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is well  settled that a principal of a corporation who performs activities on its  behalf, even if minimal, will not be considered to be totally unemployed if  such individual stands to gain from the corporation&rsquo;s continued existence&rdquo; (<u>Matter  of Ellison</u>, 57 AD3d 1194 [2008] ). This rule is repeated by the court in  virtually every business principal case. If a business principal: 1) performs  activities, 2) for an on-going business (corporation&rsquo;s continued existence),  and 3) stands to gain from those activities, he or she may be held ineligible  due to a lack of total unemployment. This rule is also fairly well understood  by the general public. Consequently, in claims for benefits by corporate  officers of on-going businesses the claimant generally contends either that  there is no activity, or that he or she does not stand to gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was  the case in <u>Matter of Ronald C. Bernard</u>, 53 AD3d 1006, in which  claimant&rsquo;s repeated denials that he was performing substantial services were  ultimately shown to be willful misrepresentations. While in benefits he had  obtained a federal ID number, opened a business checking account, written checks  from that account, paid his wife as an employee, and used the business to  provide health insurance for himself and his wife. He eventually admitted to a  good deal of other activity on behalf of this consulting business, and conceded  that it was intended to generate income. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent Appeal  Board decision (AB 542959) provides an interesting illustration of the  &ldquo;on-going&rdquo; business concept. The case concerned the president and 48%  shareholder of a restaurant that closed due to heavy damage caused by a fire.  During her claim for benefits the claimant continued to pay the corporation&rsquo;s  bills, dealt with the insurance company, arranged for estimates for the repair  work that would be necessary to re-open, and tried to negotiate a new lease  with the landlord. After a few months the claimant and other shareholders  decided not to re-open the business. Once that decision was made, the activity  performed by the claimant consisted mostly of overseeing the cleanup, writing  checks to pay outstanding creditors, and occasional meetings with insurance  adjusters. The Board held that the claimant was not totally unemployed <strong>until the principals decided not to reopen  the business.</strong> The fact that the claimant thereafter continued to engage in  various winding down activities was not significant since the business was no  longer an on-going business and it could no longer reasonably be said that the  claimant stood to gain from that activity.</p>
<p>Variation 1 &ndash; <strong>Spouse&rsquo;s  Business</strong>. There are many corporations in which spouses are 50% shareholders.  Often both spouses are active fulltime partners in the business. But in other  cases the business was always intended to be operated by one partner, while the  other was made an equal shareholder as a precaution in the event of illness or  death, or for other reasons. For example, in AB 544180, the claimant and her  spouse each owned 50% of the shares because the Small Business Administration  loan they obtained required such a structure. Whatever the reason, if the  claimant is an officer in name only, and the claimant&rsquo;s base period employment  was unrelated to the family owned corporation, the claimant should be eligible  for benefits, unless he or she decided to become fully involved in the  business. The claimant may have check writing authority, may write a few  checks, and may even stand to gain in the sense that the couple usually files a  joint tax return. Nevertheless, such factors alone do not constitute  substantial evidence of a lack of total unemployment.</p>
<p>Variation 2 &ndash; <strong>Family  Business Helper</strong> &ndash; Incidental services performed to help out in a family  business, where the claimant is performing sporadic non-remunerative activities  do not establish a lack of total unemployment. Where the claimant/helper is a  non-owner/non-shareholder and received no salary payment in the base period or  benefit year, and where the extent of the activity is the same as in the base  period and does not interfere with the claimant&rsquo;s availability, claimant should  not be held ineligible. On the other hand, a significant increase in hours  raises an availability issue. &nbsp;For a  further discussion of this topic and some specific examples see Review Letter  1-2005, <u>WORK WITHOUT PAY- LACK OF TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT</u>, page 5, <u>FAVORS</u>. </p>
Variation 3 &ndash; <strong>True  Principal &ndash;</strong> A  claimant may claim that he or she is not an officer or principal of the  business, but that the spouse really runs everything. He or she may claim to  have been laid off due to lack of work just as any other employee of the business.  There may be no documents identifying the claimant as an officer or principal.  We use the term &lsquo;true principal&rsquo; to refer to such a claimant when substantial  evidence exists that the claimant&rsquo;s statement is false and that he or she  really does run everything or that he or she jointly runs the business with the  spouse. Cases of this kind are strengthened when it is can be shown that it is  the claimant who possesses the experience and expertise necessary to run the  business, or when other evidence of an on-going involvement in the business  exists. In some cases it might be shown that the claimant had no knowledge of  how to run the business at its inception, but acquired this knowledge after  working in the business for several years. If such evidence is lacking however,  a claimant&rsquo;s statement that he or she is simply a laid off employee must be  accepted. 
<p>Variation 4 &ndash; <strong>Part-time/Sideline  Business</strong> &ndash; A common claim situation involves a person who files for  benefits due to the loss of full time employment, but who wishes to continue to  operate a part-time sideline business run from home.&nbsp; The department&rsquo;s view of this situation in  the past has been that the individual is indefinitely ineligible &ndash; the claimant  performs regular substantial services, however part-time, for an on-going  business from which he or she stands to gain. So despite the fact that the  claimant may have lost full time employment through no fault of his or her own,  no benefits would be paid. As a result, the claimant might decide to abandon  this business since the income from the business is less than what the  unemployment benefits would be. Such a claimant might have trouble convincing  us that he or she did in fact cease operations. Or if the business were an S  Corporation, such that the claimant&rsquo;s work in that business constituted covered  employment, we might issue a disqualification for voluntary leaving without  good cause. Procedures that put a claimant in such a dilemma are neither fair  nor consistent with the public policy of the state to promote employment and to  provide humanitarian relief to workers unemployed through no fault of their  own.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a claimant who operates a part-time or  sideline business should be treated in the same manner as any other part-time  worker, whether the business is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership  or an LLC. If a claimant has always operated his business two days per week he  may be entitled to receive two effective days of benefit credit. Conversely of  course, if he or she expands the business to full time, or if the work pattern is  a few hours per day on four or five days per week, then the claimant is not  totally unemployed and no benefits would be payable. (The question of whether  he or she earned in excess of the statutory maximum is quite complex &ndash; See  Special Bulletin A-710-39, <u>Self Employment</u>, par.6.)</p>
<strong>Inactive  Business</strong>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another  common type of claim involves a claimant who claims to be an officer or  principal of an inactive or dormant business. A general principle that can be  gleaned from Appeal Board decisions in such cases is: <strong>the fact that a corporation has not been dissolved does not establish  the existence of an on-going business</strong>. AB 544057, for example, concerns a  claimant who had sold all the assets of his business two years prior to filing  his original claim. Although the corporation still existed, it had no assets,  no sales, no employees, no accounts receivable, no insurance, no phone and no  office. The claimant did write checks to pay taxes and he paid an accountant to  prepare those taxes. However, as there was no activity related to the original  purpose of the business, which was producing auto shows, the business was not  on-going and the claimant was held to be eligible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar  fact patterns are found in AB 543689 and AB 542945. The claimant in both cases  had businesses that had ceased operation a few years prior to the filing of the  original claim. In the first case the claimant, a real estate broker, kept the  corporation open in order to pay her real estate licensing fees each year. But  she had not engaged in any real estate brokerage activity in years. The  claimant in the second case, also a real estate broker, ceased performing  activity in her business prior to her base period. Significantly, both claimants  worked in the base period for employers who had no relationship to the  claimant&rsquo;s businesses. <strong>Furthermore, in  both cases the Board cited the claimant&rsquo;s availability for employment in the  course of their claim for benefits as evidence of their total unemployment.</strong> The mere fact that they maintained the existence of the business entity was not  sufficient to render them ineligible for benefits. The fact that they could activate  the business at any time is not equivalent to actually doing so. Absent  evidence that a claimant has taken significant steps to re-activate a dormant  business, such a business is not on-going and determinations of continuous or  indefinite ineligibility are unwarranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;</p>
<strong>Winding  Down</strong>
<p>Since the closure of a business is  a common cause of unemployment, it is not surprising that we see so many  winding down of business cases. There is always a separation issue - voluntary  leaving - to be resolved in such cases. The most common scenarios include the  sale of the business in whole or in part, the claimant contending he was losing  money and was forced to close, or he lost his lease and could not find  affordable/suitable new space. Regardless of whether the voluntary leaving is  determined to be with good cause, the issue of lack of total unemployment must  be resolved whenever there appears to be any activity still taking place after  the filing of the original claim.</p>
<p><strong>The question that is largely determinative of the lack of total  unemployment issue in winding down cases is whether the enterprise has ceased  doing business, that is, whether it has ceased the income generating activity  for which the business was created in the first place. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In AB 424,288, (see Interpretations Service  Index 1430 #9; A 750-2068), it was highly significant that the business  premises had been vacated prior to the filing of the claim. Upon closing the  business, the claimant immediately began seeking employment. The only  subsequent activity by the claimant in connection with the business consisted  of paying some bills and consulting with an accountant about how to terminate  the corporation. The Appeal Board considered these activities to be  insignificant. In the years since that decision, the Board has reiterated and  expanded upon its view of such activity in many subsequent winding down cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In general, once the business has ceased doing business, that is, has  ceased selling the product or service that was its reason for being, activities  performed by a business principal who has ceased receiving wages are  incidental, and insufficient to justify an indefinite determination of not  totally unemployed.</strong> This is because a claimant doesn&rsquo;t really stand to gain  from subsequent activity. The idea that a business principal should be held  ineligible as long as he stands to gain from the business is often attributed  the Court&rsquo;s decision in <u>Matter of DeVivo</u>, 51 AD 2d 619, (A 750-1837). Since <u>DeVivo</u> deals with an on-going business operated by claimant&rsquo;s family  members from his home, its rule is not properly applicable to a winding down case.&nbsp; A contrasting situation exists if a business  principal continues to receive salary during a winding down phase (or any other  phase). In such circumstance it must be presumed that such payments are  compensation for services rendered and such an individual must be considered to  lack total unemployment.</p>
<p>In the Comments to A-750-2068,  cited above, it was noted that the Appeal Board had held that activity with  respect accounts payable, (bills owed by the business), &nbsp;would not cause ineligibility, whereas  activity with respect to accounts receivable, (money owed to the business), may  result in ineligibility. This is because a claimant more obviously stands to  gain from activity that results in his or her business receiving payments from outstanding  accounts. In addition, substantial accounts receivable might signify ongoing  business activity. In recent years however, the Board has taken the view that <strong>when the business has clearly closed</strong>,  the depositing of funds (accounts receivable) that are due the company does not  warrant claimant ineligibility even if the corporation has not been dissolved  (AB541903). We should nevertheless ascertain whether there are outstanding  accounts receivable in all winding down cases, and if there are, we should find  out how much is due and what, if any, steps the claimant may be taking to  collect such accounts receivable. </p>
<p>Rulings by the Board similar to  those described above include AB 544346 concerning a claimant whose Subchapter  S corporation was a business through which the claimant provided consulting  services as a nutritionist. Since the claimant had lost her only client prior  to filing her original claim for benefits, the Board did not find the  subsequent sporadic payment of checks nor the fact that the corporation had not  been dissolved, to be sufficient to establish a continuous lack of total  unemployment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the same vein, AB543967 concerned a  claimant who had operated a day spa, but who had vacated the business premises  and allowed her business insurance to lapse by the time of her original claim  filing. Since there was no evidence of an intent to resume the business  elsewhere, neither a tax advantage to the claimant nor the fact that the  business had not been dissolved were deemed important. Her writing of several  checks to pay for business debts and her selling the business&rsquo; furniture  constitute what the Board has called, (in this and many other decisions), <strong>de minimus</strong> activity, from the Latin  phrase &ldquo;de minimus non curat lex&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;the law cares not for small  things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The above theme is repeated in case  after case, including AB544192, AB534263, AB 542009, AB 543065 and others. A  different outcome resulted only from significantly different facts. In <u>Matter  of Bunting</u>, 61 AD 3d 1229, the claimant was found to have written business  related checks, participated in the sale of certain assets and equipment, and  regularly checked the mail. Significantly though, he also assisted in cleaning  out the building where the corporation was housed. Since the business premises  had not been vacated, the enumerated activities were held to be sufficient to  establish ineligibility. In the <u>Matter of DeAngelo</u>, 2008 NY Slip Op  6531, claimant was clearly in the process of winding down her business of  supplying and stocking vending machines. However, since approximately 10  vending machines remained at their respective locations during the period at  issue, (potentially generating business income), the activities in which the  claimant was engaged, (writing checks for repairs and taxes, preparing the  final tax return, filing dissolution paperwork), &nbsp;were not considered de minimus activity. The  Court affirmed the Appeal Board&rsquo;s decision that the claimant lacked total  unemployment.</p>
<p>When a business has closed its  doors, vacated the premises, surrendered the lease, allowed the insurance to  lapse, sold the building in which the corporation was housed, cancelled the  phone service and all utilities, or when it has otherwise clearly been  established that that the business has stopped selling whatever it was created  to sell, evidence that an officer or principal will reap a tax benefit (from an  S-Corporation), is writing some checks, receiving the mail, consulting with an  accountant or attorney, preparing a tax return or dissolution paperwork,  selling furniture or other minor assets, are all insufficient to establish a  lack of total unemployment. However, when the business is on-going, these same  factors can constitute evidence in support of a lack of total unemployment.  Since the existence of any accounts receivables could indicate ongoing business  activity, the amount of money involved, the numbers of accounts outstanding,  evidence of steps taken to collect the money, are additional factors that must  all be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any investigation of a business  principal or corporate officer case must begin with an inquiry into the nature  of the claimant&rsquo;s business. Such information enables us to more easily resolve  the controlling question of whether the business is on-going. Whether the  business is an old pre-existing one, a business in the start up stage, an  active base period business, or a business that is winding down, it is  generally true that minimal activity on behalf of an ongoing business from  which claimant stands to gain justifies some ineligibility. If the business is  not on-going, then there can only be incidental activity that does not justify  ineligibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determinations of ineligibility with  respect to business principals and corporate officers may apply to individual  days, particularly when the business is a part-time or sideline business. This  is applicable when the business was operated part-time in the base period, is  continued in the same manner in the benefit year, and the claimant remains  available for employment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability for employment of  corporate officers and business principals should not be ignored, even though  such evidence is insufficient by itself to resolve the total unemployment issue.  Often, such evidence is lacking or unclear. However, it is worth noting that in  five of the fifteen Board decisions cited in this publication, (AB 544567, AB  543169, AB 543689, AB 542945, and AB 424288), the Appeal Board made findings of  fact regarding the claimant&rsquo;s availability, even though that issue was not  before them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>REVIEW LETTER No. 4 - 67                                                         <br />
  Revised  March 2009<br />
  <br />
<p align="center"><u>MEDICAL EVIDENCE</u></p></p></strong>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the more  frequent reasons given for quitting or refusing a job is the harmful effects of  a worker’s health.  Medical questions  also may be involved when there is a loss of employment due to poor attendance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should  decisions in these cases rest solely upon whether or not a medical certificate  can be produced?  What significance  should be attached to the presence or absence of such a document?  And if medical information is secured, how  should it be evaluated? This Review Letter is concerned with these questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Lack of medical  evidence</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Even with today’s  medical care programs, there may be cases of voluntary leaving of employment  for reasons of health where no doctor has been consulted.  Although this may ordinarily be a fact  unfavorable to a claimant, it is not conclusive, and may be overcome in some  cases by the weight of the evidence.   Here are two Appeal Board cases which illustrate the importance of  considering surrounding circumstances:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>  Claimant, age  33, quit her job as a meat packer in Buffalo  in December, 1964 after </strong><strong>years, explaining to her employer that she was moving  with her parents and sister to Niagara Falls, making it  difficult to commute, although public   transportation was available to meet her needs.  Upon filing for benefits, she stated that  although she had always worked in the meat cooler area, in  a temperature of 40 degrees, she began experiencing in the summer of 1964  stomach cramps which she attributed to the low temperature, although she never  complained of this to anyone and never sought medical treatment for them.  She further stated that the cramps ceased  after she quit. Her attendance record was  excellent.  In sustaining a  disqualification for voluntary leaving the Board reasoned:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><strong>      “. . . we reject as incredible the claimant’s  contention of physical <br />
                  discomfort caused by the temperature in  which she worked.  For<br />
                  most of her period of employment she was  unaffected thereby.  <br />
                  Suddenly, at the time when the family is  contemplating a removal <br />
                  to a more distant residence, claimant  commences to experience<br />
                  stomach pains and suffers them, without  complain to the employer<br />
                  or a physician, until in December, the  move is imminent and she <br />
                  leaves her job, whereupon they disappear  with equal suddenness.” <br />
                  (A.B. 122,390; not reported)</strong></p>

            </blockquote>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Claimant, age 53, accepted employment with a meat  product manufacturer as the </strong><strong>operator of its smoke house.  He has experience in this line, although for  the last 19 years he had worked as a maltster ( a  skilled occupation) in a brewery. The duties of his new job included lifting  over his head containers of bologna weighing up to 70 pounds. During the day he had to make many visits to  the smoke house, where the temperature rose to as high as  220 degrees, causing him to perspire excessively and to break out in a  rash.  In addition he was required to  enter the cooler at the end of the day which gave him  chills.  He quit after a week and a half,  his weight having dropped from 180 to 165 pounds, but without consulting a doctor. Despite the lack of medical evidence, the Appeal Board  found credible claimant’s contention that the employment was detrimental to his  health, and overruled a disqualification for voluntary quit  (A.B. TEC-254; not reported).</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comparing the  above decisions, it may be noted that because of the existence of other  relevant evidence, the absence of a medical certificate was significant in the  first case but not in the second.  Such  factors as age, training and experience, length of employment, claimant’s  recitation of the symptoms, and other possible reasons or motives, may tip the  scales either way. </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Chronic  ailments</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>A claimant who  alleges he quit because if was aggravating a chronic ailment may sometimes  submit medical evidence which confirms the existence of the condition but  indicates that he was not specifically advised to stop performing the work in  question.  The resolution of this type of  case may require, in addition to good judgment on the part of the claims examiner,  accurate information on the duties and conditions of the job.  Thus, although they were not advised to quit  their jobs, the following claimants were held by the Appeal Board to have left  with good cause (Not reported in the Service):</strong></p>
<p><strong>     A postal clerk with chronic asthma who was  required to work under conditions of excessive<br />
  heat, dust and high rate of speed.  (UCFE-720)</strong></p>
<p><strong>     A runner for a brokerage firm with osteoarthritis  of the right knee  (88,357)</strong></p>
<p><strong>     A tugboat deckhand with a duodenal ulcer  who was required to work irregular hours and<br />
  for continuous periods of up to 16 hours.  (90,288)</strong></p>
<p><strong>     A sewing machine operator suffering from  high blood pressure and obesity who took a job<br />
  trimming onions and left after a month  because she could not get accustomed to the odor<br />
  of onions which caused nausea and  vomiting. (130,192)</strong></p>
<p><strong>In a recent  misconduct case, AB 542498, the Board found that because the claimant’s illness  was due to a recurrent chronic condition (asthma &amp; bronchitis) which the  claimant knew how to treat with her previously prescribed medications, it was  not significant that she did see a doctor on the day of her last absence. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Similarly, the  Board has held refusal of employment to be with good cause in the following cases,  where the claimant’s affliction was chronic, although there was no recent  medical treatment or specific advice to avoid such work:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A sales clerk who refused referral to such  work in the basement of a department store on<br />
    the ground, based on a previous  experience, that the dampness would aggravate her<br />
    arthritic back ailment.  (Index 1245 #5)<br />
    <br />
    A laborer in a carborundum plant who  because the dust aggravated his asthmatic<br />
    condition, secured temporary work  outdoors, and later refused re-employment in <br />
    the plant for the same reason he  quit.  The Board stated:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>“It  may well be that the safeguards against dust in the employer’s plant satisfy necessary standards but we  are dealing with a subjective situation which makes work for this claimant,  in an atmosphere which has some dust, unsuitable for him . . .”  (A.B. 120,306; not reported)</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That judgmental  evaluations can also lead to conclusions which are adverse to the claimant is  illustrated in the recent case of waitress who quit her job after one month  alleging that the work aggravated a back condition which she incurred in 1962.  She submitted a medical statement indicating  that she suffered from a long-lasting lumbar sacral strain but that she did not  receive any medical treatment for this condition from 1962 until late January  1966, about four months after she left her job.   In deciding that the claimant left her employment without good cause,  the Board noted these widely separated dates and concluded that “the medical  evidence is insufficient to establish a casual relationship between claimant’s  alleged back condition and her leaving of her employment.”  (A.B. 128,902; not reported)</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The effects of  commuting</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Just as the  absence of medical advice to quit is not conclusive, so the existence of such  advice must be considered in the light of other evidence. This is demonstrated  in cases where there is a voluntary quit supported by the advice of a physician  to stop traveling to work. Here are two examples:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Claimant, a secretary, was employed by a public  relations firm in New York City  for </strong><strong>seven years, during the last two of which  she commuted from her home on Long Island, with a travel time of almost two hours  each way.  In the fall of 1961, claimant  was treated for influenza, and informed her  supervisor that she intended to resign because her doctor advised her to discontinue  commuting.  However, since it was the  busy season, she continued on the job until  the end of January, 1962.  She presented  to the local office as statement from the doctor  confirming this advice.  In sustaining a disqualification for voluntary quit, the  Board said:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>“The  medical certificate submitted by claimant fails to indicate <br />
                the basis for any advice  rendered by the physician with respect <br />
                to the avoidance of travel.  It is significant that claimant <br />
                continued in the  employment for several months after she recovered <br />
                from the illness for which  she was treated by the physician.” (A.B. 93,498;<br />
                not reported)</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>In another case, a clerk-typist residing in Yonkers quit her job in Manhattan after six</strong><strong> years because she felt the traveling was  affecting her health.  In the last three  months of
  her employment, her travel had increased  because the firm moved from mid to lower
  Manhattan,  although the travel time still did not exceed one and one-half hours. Her
  doctor  certified “patient feels that riding in trains and subways causes her to have
  frequent colds due to drafts and temperature  changes” and he further stated
  “avoidance of commutation advisable.”  The Appeal Board nevertheless found that
  claimant left her job without good cause,  noting that claimant’s attendance record
  was  satisfactory and the travel time was not excessive, and concluding:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>“There  is insufficient proof that claimant was compelled to leave her <br />
                job for reasons of  health.  The most that can be said is  that claimant’s <br />
                doctor agreed with  claimant that she might feel better if she were not <br />
                required to commute . . .  .  The same might be said of practically  every<br />
                employed person who commutes any distance  (A-750-1233; Index 1655 #5)</strong></p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Pressures of  the job</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>A person may  state that he was compelled to leave his job because he could no longer cope  with its physical requirements or the pressures and tensions stemming from the  attendant responsibilities, workloads or deadlines.  Ordinarily, there is no reason to question  the evidence which he presents concerning the care, opinion and advice received  from his physician.  However, there may  be times when such questioning is warranted, as shown in the following recently  decided cases:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Claimant, age 66, told the local office he sold his 50%  stock interest in a restaurant </strong><strong>corporation to his nephew, and resigned  as secretary-treasurer and manager in  March 1966, because he could not get along with  the president, the other 50% owner. He
  further stated he was not sick or under  doctor’s care and was not advised to leave.
  However, at the referee <em>(now called administrative law judge)</em> hearing he stated
  the repeated arguments made him so  nervous that he consulted a doctor in October
  1965  who advised him to do other work.  He  presented a note to this effect, dated
  October 1965, which he admittedly  obtained two weeks before the hearing of September
  1966.</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong> In sustaining a disqualification for voluntary  quit the Board said in part:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>“We reject claimant’s testimony that he  was directed to quit his job by his<br />
              physician.   When interviewed at the local office claimant denied being <br />
              ill  and likewise denied that he had been advised to sell out his shares of<br />
              stock  in the corporation . . .  .  We conclude that claimant’s statement at  <br />
              the  local office interview was true and that his later version was not.”   <br />
              (134,916;  not reported)</strong></p>

  <li><strong>In May 1966, claimant, a bank clerk, asked for  permission to extend her two week paid </strong><strong>vacation in July by an additional two  weeks without pay in order to accompany her
  daughter and son-in-law on an extended  trip.  Despite denial of her request, she  went
  on the trip, and during the third week  sent a telegram stating that she was taking the
  extra time on the advice of her  doctor.  She was thereupon  terminated.  She presented
  to the local office a medical  certificate (form ES 340) indicating a single visit to the
  doctor, on July 19, 1966, four days  before the start of her vacation, and stating that a
  month’s rest was recommended because of  “asthenia” (weakness, debility, exhaustion).
  Nevertheless, a disqualification for  voluntary quit (provoked discharge) was imposed
  which was sustained by the Referee and  not appealed further.  In his decision,the
  Referee indicated that not only did  claimant fail to inform her employer of her
  her  alleged medical need before she started her vacation, but also that:</strong>

<p><strong><u>Contradictory  information</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sometimes the  medical certificate contains a diagnosis, a recitation of treatment dates, or a  statement of the advice given to the patient which conflicts with statements  made by the claimant to the local office.   The certificate may even conflict with other certificates from the same  or other physicians.  Such a situation  often can be used to advantage when attempting to arrive at the “ultimate”  facts, as shown in the following cases:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>A sewing machine operator contended that she left her  job on October 5, 1964 </strong><strong>because the conditions of employment,  particularly arguments with co-workers,
  caused her to suffer nervous spasms, for  which she was under medical treatment.
  There was also evidence that prior to  quitting she had protested to her union
  representatives because she believed she  was not receiving the correct incentive
  bonus payments, but was advised by them  to remain on the job.  She produced a
  certificate from her physician  stating:  “In October 1964 I advised her  to leave her
  position of work.  She was working under conditions of great  tension, which gave
  her severe intestinal spasms.”  In sustaining a disqualification of voluntary quit the
  Board said:</strong>

                conditions of employment.  It is significant that claimant’s physician <br />
                stated that he had advised claimant to leave  her job in October, <br />
                whereas claimant did not see the physician  during that month until<br />

  <li><strong>A stock brokerage clerk who resigned after six years on  February 17, 1965 for “medical reasons” submitted medical statements indicating  that she had been treated for an </strong><strong>upper respiratory virus infection from  December 14, 1964 to  January 20, 1965 (discharged cured) and that she suffered  from general  weakness and anemia and has 
  been advised to resign in order to get  more rest and improve her general health.
  She filed for benefits on March 1, 1965.  However, the employer’s records indicated that
  she was absent from December  1  to 4, 1964 for cystitis and on  February 16, 1965 for a
  virus, and was not absent from work for  any reason from December 14, 1964 to
  January  20, 1965.   The Appeal Board held the quit to  be without good cause, stating:</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>“The credible evidence indicates that whatever may have been<br />
                claimant’s reason  for leaving her employment, it was not in <br />
                the interest of protecting her health.  The medical statements <br />
                are of  little probative value because, as recognized by the referee,<br />
                they  are inconsistent, both with each other and with the <br />
                employer’s attendance records  . . .”  (<u>A.B. ???,</u>189, not reported) </strong></p>
            </blockquote>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Claimant, a wirer and solderer for a manufacturer of  electronic devices, was </strong><strong>discharged on April 13, 1962  because of absence that day despite prior warning about her poor attendance. Her excuse for that last absence was that she  had to take her daughter to the doctor. However, the doctor submitted a medical certificate indicatingthat neither claimant nor her  daughter visited his office during the entire month of April. The Board, therefore, rejecting claimant’s  excuse, concluded that the absence was for non-compelling reasons and sustained a disqualification. (A.B. 93,119; not reported).</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Possibility  of reassignment</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>In  1962, the Appeal Board considered the case of a floor man for a wire and cable  manufacturing company who quit his job after three weeks telling his employer  that he had another job.  When he filed  for benefits he stated that the true reason was that he suffered from  claustrophobia and could not work in a factory. When he applied for the job he  filled out a detailed medical questionnaire in which he stated that he had no  prior history of mental illness, which was not tue, since he had been under  medical care for psychoneurosis for several month just prior to this job.  Since the employer reported that had the  claimant presented his problem, he would have been transferred to outside  employment, the quit was held to be without good cause (A.B. 93,411, not  reported in the Service)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This  case points up the necessity for finding out whether a claimant, who was no  longer able to perform his assigned tasks or whose health was being adversely  affected by his work, sought other avenues of solution instead of quitting.  It would also be important to determine  whether such efforts might have been successful, rather than futile gestures.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Possibility  of a leave of absence</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The  principle that a claimant does not have good cause for voluntary leaving unless  he had explored all other alternatives includes asking for a leave of absence  where the ailment or disability is of a temporary nature. Such a circumstance  was at issue in AB 493468 concerning a cashier for a retail chain of stores who  left employment due to pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc.  The period of claimant’s disability was about  two months, and the employer indicated that they would have offered her  physically suitable work as a greeter, or a leave of absence. However, the  claimant never asked. Instead she stayed out of work for a while and then  resigned. The Board, finding that her actions lacked prudence, held her subject  to disqualification for voluntary leaving without good cause.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Denial  of a Reasonable Accommodation or Leave Request </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>The  concept of “reasonable accommodation” developed in the period since the first  release of this publication in 1967. It is defined as: “…any modification or  adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified  applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application  process or to perform essential job functions.” <u>USDOJ (Department of  Justice)</u> If a claimant alleges that his or her employment loss related to physical  restrictions with respect to duties or working conditions, and that the  restrictions were caused by a permanent or temporary disability, it is  necessary to establish whether convincing evidence of these restrictions exist  and whether such evidence was presented to the employer. Loss of employment in  such circumstances is not at all uncommon as in the following cases: </strong></p>
<p><strong>A fire safety director for a hotel, able to work only part-time while  recovering from kidney surgery, was held to have had a compelling reason for  failing to return to work as the employer insisted he work full time and failed  to explain why his request could not be granted (AB 540711).</strong></p>
<p><strong>A front desk clerk for a hotel requested permission to sit while on duty  in order to relieve occasional dizziness brought on by her pregnancy. Although  the employer knew the claimant was pregnant, her request was denied. The Appeal  Board found it significant that the employer presented no evidence to support  their assertion that claimant was informed that she must submit a doctor’s note  in order to obtain the requested accommodation.   The employer’s refusal to provide an accommodation for claimant’s  temporary disability gave the claimant good cause to leave (AB 542082)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusions</u></strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>When a claimant states he quit or refused a job for       reasons of health, he  should be </strong><strong>questioned to find out whether he is or  has been under medical care.  However,  this does not rule out the possibility of denial of  benefits despite such care, or payment of benefits in the absence of such care,  when other evidence is considered.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li><strong>The probative value of a medical certificate should be weighed in the light of the </strong><strong>circumstances of the case. For example, it  may contain, instead of a diagnosis, a 
  description of claimant’s  complaint, or it may be merely a repetition of claimant’s
  feelings regarding the cause  of his ailment rather than a confirmation of them.
  Also, it may contain advice  which is not obvious from the diagnosis, yet with no
  basis given for such advice.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li><strong>A medical certificate may fail to support, and may even refute, a claimant’s contentions. </strong><strong>For example, the diagnosis (estimate of  the future course of the ailment), treatment dates and advice given may be at variance  with the information supplied by the claimant. There may be a lack of correlation with  the claimant’s job attendance record. Or  the medical visit and treatment dates may be  so remote from the separation or refusal date that a causal relationship is  questionable. </strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li><strong>The fact that a medical certificate confirms claimant’s statements regarding his ailment </strong><strong>and his doctor’s advice to quit should  not automatically result in a determination in the claimant’s favor, since there may by  other controlling factors. For example,  the claimant may have exaggerated or incorrectly  described to his physician the conditions under which he worked or the duties he performed. Also, the claimant may have failed to  request or  accept an exemption from some duties, a reassignment or transfer, or, if the  health condition is temporary, a  leave of absence which was available to him. Thus verification with  employer or physician may be in order.</strong></li>

  <strong><u><div align = center>UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE &ndash; PRINCIPLES &amp; PRACTICES</div></u></strong></p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In difficult economic conditions the  unemployment insurance system becomes increasingly important.&nbsp; As has happened often before, a rise in the  unemployment rate and the resulting extension of benefits requires that the  department provide services to larger numbers of people for longer periods.  These are the precise circumstances for which unemployment insurance was  created. This Review Letter is intended to re-affirm the Department&rsquo;s mission  to pay Unemployment Insurance benefits when due to those who lose their jobs  through no fault of their own. In the absence of credible, sufficient evidence  that a denial of benefits is appropriate, prompt payment of benefits claimed is  our highest priority. </p>
<p>As part of the Department of Labor, the UI  Division also shares a duty to extend the protection of Labor Laws to all  entitled workers. This Review Letter will also discuss that perspective in the  context of some selected issues that have been the subject of recent decisions  by the Appeal Board and Department initiatives. In other instances, an analysis  rooted in the purpose of the system has given rise to a new view of an old  problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The unemployment insurance system, enacted  during the Great Depression, serves several purposes. It fulfills a  humanitarian objective clearly defined in Section 501 of New York&rsquo;s  Unemployment Insurance Law that declares the public policy of the state as  follows: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a  serious menace to the health, welfare, and morale of the people of this state.  Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern  which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and  to lighten its burden, which now so often falls with crushing force upon the  unemployed worker and his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The  system&rsquo;s second, broader aim is to minimize the effect of a national economic  downturn or recession, by putting money into circulation during periods of high  unemployment. These funds have been referred to as &ldquo;high velocity dollars&rdquo;, by  which is meant that the money will be immediately spent. This rapid spending  slows down the vicious cycle of a recession whereby layoffs cause loss in  income, followed by reductions in consumer spending, which in turn leads to  further business failures and layoffs caused by reduced sales revenue and  lowered demand for products that people can&rsquo;t afford to buy. &nbsp;Unemployment insurance also helps to prevent  the dispersal of the employer&rsquo;s trained labor force, the sacrifice of skills,  and the breakdown of labor standards during temporary unemployment. &nbsp;Since its inception seventy seven years ago,  the system has been a complete success. It is credited with having shortened  recessions and it has provided a crucial safety net in hard times for millions  of unemployed workers and their families.</p>
<p><u>BENEFITS &ldquo;WHEN DUE&rdquo;</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nationwide Unemployment  Insurance system was established by the enactment of the Social Security Act in  1935. Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act requires a state  unemployment law to provide for &ldquo;&hellip;such methods of administration &hellip;as are found  by the Secretary of Labor to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of  unemployment insurance compensation <strong>when  due</strong>.&rdquo; (emphasis added)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A discussion of the mandate to pay benefits  &ldquo;when due&rdquo; is a useful context from which we gain perspective on the time  tables and guidelines for making determinations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In a 1971 case before the United States Supreme  Court, <em>California Department of Human  Resources v. Java</em>, 402 U.S. 121(1971), the phrase &ldquo;when due&rdquo; was  interpreted by the Court to mean &ldquo;at the earliest stage of unemployment that  such payments [are] administratively feasible after giving both the worker and  the employer an opportunity to be heard.&rdquo;&nbsp;  In its decision, the Court found that a provision of California&rsquo;s  Unemployment Law requiring benefits to be withheld during the pendency of an  employer&rsquo;s objection to the claimant&rsquo;s eligibility, (after due process fact  finding and the issuance of a determination of eligibility), violated the &ldquo;when  due&rdquo; provision of the Social Security Act. The statutory phrase &ldquo;when due&rdquo; and  the Court&rsquo;s interpretation of it, form the basis for the US Department of  Labor&rsquo;s guidelines for the issuance of timely unemployment insurance  determinations and payments that New York and all other states are required to  follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The  Federal timeliness guidelines for payments and determinations recognize that in  some cases fact-finding may be lengthy and complex, but require nevertheless  that the largest proportion of claims be examined and resolved as quickly as feasible.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><u>CREDIBILTIY IN  SEPARATION ISSUES</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The <em>Java</em> decision brought about revisions in federally mandated procedures for obtaining  information and issuing determinations in disputed claims: &ldquo;The Court&rsquo;s stress  on speeding benefit payments to unemployed workers suggests this factor  appropriately is the key criterion to be used in choosing among alternative  procedures for implementing the requirements stated in the decision. This  objective of prompt payment seems clearly, in the Court&rsquo;s view, to suffuse the  entire unemployment insurance program.&rdquo; (U.I.P.L. No. 1145, Section I, <u>Promptness  of Payment</u>, para. 5 November 12, 1971)</p>
<p>Everything should be done to avoid delays in the  issuance of benefit payments due to uncertainties about claimant or employer credibility.  Although the Department&rsquo;s fact-finding processes are consistent with federal  standards and are designed to ease the resolution of factual disputes, the  information may still be incomplete. Although there is no such thing as a  perfect case, nevertheless decisions must be made expeditiously:<br>
  &nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Determinations on issues arising in  connection with new claims may be considered on time within the meaning of the  Court&rsquo;s requirement for promptness if accomplished no later than the second  week after the week in which the claim is effective&rdquo; </strong>(UIPL No. 1145, Section  IV, <u>Promptness of the Determination Process, para. 1</u> November 12, 1971).<strong> </strong>The Federal<strong> </strong>timeliness standards mandate that non-monetary determinations be  made in twenty-one days upon the detection of an issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>When an employer&rsquo;s statement consists entirely  of repeated general accusations that the claimant violated a &ldquo;known policy&rdquo; and  despite requests for details or clarification, none is forthcoming, there is no  information to overcome the statement provided by the claimant. If the claimant  denies the accusations, the determination is made in the claimant&rsquo;s favor since  there is an insufficient basis for denying benefits. As previously discussed in  Field Memo 5-85, which dealt specifically with &ldquo;Fact Finding and Employer  Service Companies,&rdquo; when an allegation is made against a claimant by an  employer representative or agent, and that allegation is directly denied by the  claimant, the rules of evidence permit us to give greater weight to the  claimant&rsquo;s statement. Undocumented contentions conveyed to the department by  someone who does not possess first hand knowledge of the pertinent facts should  not be given greater weight than a claimant&rsquo;s first-hand denial. However,  employers should first be told that their failure to provide the requested  details or clarification and/or access to individuals with first-hand knowledge  of the relevant circumstances may result in greater weight being given to the  claimant&rsquo;s first-hand statement. </p>
<p>The Appellate Division of the NY State Supreme  Court, describing the philosophical basis of the Unemployment Law, has written:  &ldquo;This is a remedial statute, a humanitarian statute, and should be construed  accordingly. It is the general rule that a liberal construction is accorded  statutes which are regarded by courts as humanitarian and which are grounded on  a humane public policy&rdquo; (Matter of Machcinski, 277 AD 634).&nbsp; If it appears, despite reasonable attempts to  obtain information from both parties, that each party&rsquo;s position is equally  believable or equally supported by evidence, the matter should simply be  resolved in the claimant&rsquo;s favor. There may be extraordinary situations that  might justify further investigation. But when the claimant and the employer are  equally believable, our determination should result in claimant eligibility. As  applied to matters of credibility, a &ldquo;liberal construction&rdquo; means: <strong>when both parties are equally believable,  pay the claimant</strong>. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Resolving such situations in the claimant&rsquo;s  favor is consistent with the overall purpose of the unemployment insurance  program. After reasonable fact-finding, the claimant should be given the  benefit of a doubt whenever credibility or the weight of evidence seems evenly  balanced. In this way, benefits can be paid promptly, and the state as a whole  benefits from the additional funds put in circulation. Such determinations are completely  proper, provided they are supported by substantial evidence. It is important to  remember that parties have hearing rights and that the initial determination is  not the final word on the question of a claimant&rsquo;s eligibility. Additional  discussion of the topic of credibility may be found in <u>REVIEW LETTER 2-84,  Attendance Related Separation Issues</u>, Section VII, CREDIBILITY. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>QUIT DUE TO HEALTH REASONS</u><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  It is well established that a claimant can have  good cause to leave employment harmful to his health, provided no other remedy  is feasible. However, the question of whether a doctor advised a claimant to  leave, while important, is not always controlling. Such advice is simply one  piece of evidence. A claimant may establish good cause for leaving a job due to  health reasons, even though his/her doctor did not advise quitting. Whether a  health condition or a danger to the claimant&rsquo;s health actually existed, and  whether such health condition was caused by or would be exacerbated by  continued employment must be determined by examining all of the facts and  circumstances, not solely relying on whether a claimant was specifically  advised by a doctor to leave his job. Applications of these principles are  discussed in several case summaries below. However, a more complete discussion  of the topic of medical evidence can be found in <u>Review Letter No. 4-67,  MEDICAL EVIDENCE</u>, re-released March 2009.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some circumstances the conditions of the job  are easily shown to be harmful. Several employees of a thermometer factory  developed headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms that were eventually shown  to be typical of mercury poisoning. Their complaints to the NYC Department of  Health resulted in a temporary closure of the factory by order of the  Department due to impermissible levels of mercury vapor in the air in several  areas in the factory. Workers who quit after learning of these facts were held  to have quit with good cause regardless of whether they had any symptoms or had  consulted a doctor. Their fears that continuing in that employment would be  harmful to their health were genuine and reasonable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A recent case concerned a claimant who developed  a condition known as deep vein thrombosis. His treatment for the condition was  well documented. The doctor advised the claimant to avoid standing for long  periods of time. However, since the claimant&rsquo;s job required long periods of  standing, it did not matter that the doctor did not specifically advise the  claimant to quit. Good cause was established when the facts made it clear that  continuing in that job was harmful to this claimant&rsquo;s health due to his  specific condition. &nbsp;In a case such as  this, after determining a claimant to be eligible for benefits, the task of the  Unemployment Insurance Division is to assist the claimant in finding a  different occupation by referring him for evaluation and counseling. (See <u>Special  Bulletin A 710-23 Search for Work,</u> Section 3, para. 4, November 17, 1981)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Appeal Board 542700 concerned a claimant whose  chronic asthmatic bronchitis was worsened by various allergens and irritants in  the employer&rsquo;s workplace and who, as a result, had arranged to work for the  employer from her home. She ultimately quit when the employer&rsquo;s requirement  that she attend training at the employer&rsquo;s premises caused her to become ill.  Although a doctor did not advise the claimant to quit, the Appeal Board decided  that &ldquo;&hellip;the claimant had satisfactorily established her long term medical  disability without the need for current corroborative medical documentation.  Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant quit her job for a compelling  medical reason&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A claimant was held by the Appeal Board to have  left with good cause when her doctor advised leaving the job due to heart  palpitations caused by an increased work load and the harassment of her  supervisor, who the Board found &ldquo;&hellip;regularly berated, yelled at and criticized  the claimant.&rdquo; (AB542712) Significantly, the employer failed to reduce any of  the claimant&rsquo;s oral complaints to writing as their Human Resources policy  required, nor did the employer make any effort to address her complaints about  the supervisor&rsquo;s behavior. </p>
<p>After an absence of several days due to an  episode of gout, a security guard informed his employer that he was ready to  return to work. At the employer&rsquo;s request he forwarded to the employer medical  documentation obtained at the onset of his illness explaining the reason for  his absence. When the employer demanded more recent documentation releasing him  to return to work he was unable to comply promptly due to the fact that he had  neither medical insurance nor a primary care physician. When it was clear to  him that he would be unable to submit the required documentation by the  deadline, he left his job rather than face certain dismissal. He was held to  have left with good cause (AB541982).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;When a  doctor explicitly leaves the decision to quit up to the claimant, there can  still be a finding of good cause. The Appeal Board recently ruled in AB 543291that  medical evidence indicated that claimant experienced a high risk pregnancy due  to a history of hypertension. Because she was pregnant, she was unable to take  her usual medications for migraines, or medication for lumbar pain. In the  month prior to her separation, she spoke to her physician about the stress she  was under at her job. The physician advised her to consider stopping work  earlier than she had intended if the stress became too great. During the next  month she felt increasing stress due to her employer&rsquo;s assigning additional  duties to her and left her job. A claimant&rsquo;s subjective judgment regarding the  effect of stress is not generally sufficient to establish good cause for quitting.  But in this case there was substantial medical evidence supporting the  claimant&rsquo;s decision, as well as evidence establishing the stressful nature of  her work which, taken together, established good cause for leaving.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  In another recent decision, AB 543446, the  Appeal Board addressed the case of an asthmatic claimant whose complaints to  her employer with respect to her co-workers&rsquo; smoking in the office went  unheeded for some time. Ultimately, the claimant was forced to quit. The Board,  relying on an Appellate Division decision, (<u>Matter of Halpern</u>, 265 AD2d  702), stated that &ldquo;&hellip;fear for one&rsquo;s health caused by cigarette smoke in the  workplace constitutes good cause to quit, even without proof of allergy to  cigarette smoke, or medical advice to quit.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  By contrast, there have been cases in which the  doctor statement was deemed to be unacceptable as evidence supporting good  cause to quit. In AB 513240, the Board sustained a disqualification, finding  that the doctor&rsquo;s note produced by claimant was dated three months after she  had quit. The Appeal Board concluded that her resignation was not based upon a  doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis, but instead upon her own opinion that her job was causing  her stress.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Thus, medical evidence must be evaluated for  credibility and connection to the action of quitting just as any other evidence  must be. Good cause for quitting due to health reasons can be established by  evidence of a claimant&rsquo;s medical history and chronic conditions. It need not be  based on recent advice from a doctor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <u>MISCLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS</u></p>
<p>The misclassification of workers has become a  major concern of the Department of Labor. Many employers classify workers as  Independent Contractors rather than as employees in order to avoid taxation and  the expense of other employment protections, such as overtime. On September 5,  2007, Executive Order #17 was issued, establishing The Joint Enforcement Task  Force on Employee Misclassification. Since its inception, the Task Force has  initiated a significant number of investigations, discovered thousands of  misclassified workers, and has identified millions of dollars in unreported  remuneration, underpaid wages, and additional unemployment insurance taxes due.  Fines have been levied and collected, and the most egregious of these employer  offenders have been prosecuted criminally. </p>
<p>The Telephone Claim Center&rsquo;s role in this  initiative is the identification of potentially misclassified workers who file  claims for Unemployment Insurance Benefits, both at the time of an Original Claim  filing, and when a claim is re-opened after &ldquo;Self-Employment&rdquo; or &ldquo;Independent Contractor&rdquo;  work. It has long been the Department&rsquo;s policy to permit the filing of claims  by workers who were paid as Independent Contractors or whose earnings were  reported on Form 1099, even when such workers have signed a contract in which  they agree to be treated as Independent Contractors. Section 595.1 of the UI  Law states &ldquo;No agreement by an employee to waive his rights under this article  shall be valid.&rdquo; The Appeal Board and the Courts have held that this section of  the law renders invalid such Independent Contractor agreements. &nbsp;The duties of claims staff in these cases  entail careful fact finding and prompt forwarding of the information obtained  to the Liability &amp; Determinations Section, so that the scope of  unemployment insurance protection among workers in the labor force can be  broadened where warranted and so that benefits can be paid when due. (See UI  Benefit Operations 447 Procedure, 10/15/08)</p>
<p>With regard to fact finding in this area, while  the law does not define an independent contractor, court decisions have held  that the common law tests of master and servant must be applied. All factors  concerning the relationship between the two parties must be taken into consideration  to determine if the party contracting for the services exercises or has the  right to exercise, such supervision, direction or control over the person  performing such services. If the circumstances demonstrate either the exercise  of, or the right to exercise, such supervision, direction or control, an  employer-employee relationship exists. Form IA 318.14 (6-93) lists some of the  more significant examples of indicators of an employment relationship and can  be used as guidance in determining if an individual is an employee or an  independent contractor.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The Department&rsquo;s aim in broadening coverage is  consistent with instructions issued to the states by the Federal Department of  Labor: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Social legislation such as FUTA is to be  construed broadly with respect to coverage and benefits. Exceptions to its  statutory remedies are to be narrowly construed.&rdquo; (U.I.P.L. 43-93, September  13, 1993).</p>
<p><u>CASH &ldquo;OFF THE BOOKS&rdquo; WAGES &amp; LIMITED ENGLISH  PROFICIENCY</u></p>
<p>In the past, the Department has often rejected  claims for benefits with respect to workers paid &ldquo;off the books&rdquo; due to a lack  of evidence of employment. Such a view distorts the reality of the problem.  Some workers agree to an off the books arrangement, either to simply avoid the  payment of taxes by payroll deduction, or to conceal the simultaneous receipt  of worker&rsquo;s compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, or some  other entitlement. When apprehended such workers are properly held accountable  for the illegal receipt of those benefits. But there are other workers who have  little or nothing to say about how they are paid, who must accept the  employer&rsquo;s illegal practices in order to work at all. In such instances it is  the employer who stands most to gain from the arrangement, while the worker has  much to lose. </p>
<p>The employer violates a variety of Labor Laws in  any off the books arrangement. However much a worker might want to work off the  books, he cannot do so without the employer&rsquo;s participation. The converse  though, is not true. An employer can impose such an arrangement on a worker  even when the employee is unwilling. The worker&rsquo;s choices are often simply:  work off the books, or not at all.&nbsp; Since  the employer has a greater degree of control, and since he bears a greater  legal burden, it follows that he is held responsible. For these reasons, the  Department of Labor has committed its resources to ending those employer practices  designed to enable the employer to evade the costs of &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; taxation, wage and hour compliance, worker  safety provisions, worker&rsquo;s compensation coverage, or any benefits typically  provided to employees.&rdquo; (Report of the Joint Enforcement Task Force on Employee  Misclassification, February 1, 2008)<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;The Task  Force also noted in its Report that immigrant workers are especially vulnerable  to this kind of practice, due to language limitations, fear of being reported for  immigration violations, and perhaps less awareness of the protections to which  the law actually entitles them. It was also reported that both  misclassification of workers, and paying workers &ldquo;off the books&rdquo; were trends  that appeared to have increased over the past decade. </p>
<p>For these reasons, new procedures and forms are  being developed that will enable claimants paid off the books to file claims  and more easily establish benefit eligibility. The Department has been working  for several years to expand services available to claimants with Limited  English Proficiency. The Department will soon offer enhanced services in ten  languages. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>SUMMARY</u></p>
<p>In the words of the United States Supreme Court,  the purpose of the Unemployment Insurance System is &ldquo;&hellip;the protection of its  beneficiaries from some of the hardships of existence.&rdquo; <em>U.S.</em><em> v. Silk</em>, 331 U.S. 704, 712 (1947). To achieve  the goals of this &lsquo;social legislation,&rsquo; the Division seeks to broaden the scope  of coverage and to pay benefits when due. Employers and claimants are given an  opportunity to provide information to the Department with regard to the  claimant&rsquo;s separation from employment and we must carefully review and weigh  all this evidence prior to making an eligibility determination. However, given  the nature and public purpose of the Unemployment Insurance program, after  impartial fact-finding, evenly balanced cases of eligibility, entitlement or  coverage should be determined in the claimant&rsquo;s favor, bearing in mind the  parties&rsquo; rights to a hearing.</p>

<h3 align="center"><u>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</u></h3>
<p>It has been ten years since  the prior publication of the Review Letter discussing the issue of separation  from employment resulting from circumstances involving domestic violence. There  have been changes to the NYS UI Law and Penal Law since then, which bear on  adjudicating these claims. Case law has also continued to develop, helping to  refine our understanding of the application of the legislative changes to these  cases. This publication replaces Review Letter 2-96, which should be removed.<br>
  By passing Labor Law &sect; 593(1)(a),&nbsp;which provides that domestic  violence may be good cause for a voluntary separation from work, New York State  made a commitment to ensuring that working individuals who must leave a job  because of domestic violence have the economic security they need to separate  from an abuser.<br>
  It remains the Department  of Labor&rsquo;s policy to provide continued sensitivity to victims of domestic  violence, while conducting appropriate fact-finding necessary to establish the  basis for correct determinations in benefit claims. </p>
<p align="center"><u>DEFINITION</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Domestic violence permeates the lives and compromises the  safety of thousands of workers in New    York State  each day, with tragic, destructive, and often fatal results. Domestic violence  occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships, including married and formerly  married couples, same-sex couples, couples with children in common, and couples  who live together or have lived together. </p>
<p align="left">  Domestic violence is generally  defined as a pattern of coercive tactics which can include physical,  psychological, sexual, economic and emotional abuse perpetrated by one person  against a family or household member, with the goal of establishing and  maintaining power and control over the victim. It is not a private matter. In  addition to exacting a tremendous toll from the individuals it directly  affects, domestic violence often spills over into the workplace, compromising  the safety of both victims and co-workers and resulting in lost productivity,  increased health care costs, increased absenteeism, and increased employee  turnover. </p>
<p align="center"><u>VOLUNTARY LEAVING OF EMPLOYMENT</u></p>
<p align="left">  The most common issue raised in unemployment  benefit claims involving domestic violence is voluntary leaving of employment,  often resulting from relocation of claimant's residence. <br>
  Labor Law &sect; 593.<a name="593x1">1</a> (a) states: &ldquo;A voluntary separation may also be  deemed for good cause if it occurred as a consequence of circumstances directly  resulting from the claimant being a victim of domestic violence&rdquo;.<br>
As discussed below,  benefits have been granted in a variety of circumstances in which domestic  violence caused a separation from employment. These include cases in which  violence or harassment has occurred at the workplace as well as cases in which,  as a result of violence at home or at work, an individual chooses to relocate  to protect herself and her family. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<u>FACT FINDING</u> </p>
<p align="left"> When a victim of domestic  violence has lost employment as a result of domestic violence circumstances,  whether through a voluntary quit or a discharge, claims adjudicators must be  aware of the particularly sensitive nature of the details involved, and the  difficulty some victims of domestic violence may have in disclosing information  or in gathering evidence. Many incidents of domestic violence go unreported to  the police; victims do not always seek medical treatment for injuries caused by  domestic violence. Fact finding may be complicated by the victim&rsquo;s need to keep  information confidential out of concerns for continuing safety.<u></u><br>
  While no single factor is  determinative, these questions may help determine whether the claimant is in  fact a victim of domestic violence and whether the separation was a result of  the violence. <br>
  *What evidence is there  that claimant or another family member was a victim of domestic violence?<br>
  *Was a police report filed?  (Request a copy) If not, why not?<br>
  *Did claimant seek medical  care? If not, why not? <br>
  *Where did the  assault/abuse occur; at the workplace, at home, at some other location? More  than one location?<br>
  *Did the domestic violence  occur on more than one occasion? What was the most recent incident?<br>
  *If the claimant has  separated from the abuser, determine whether there have been any further  attempt by the abuser to harass or assault claimant? If yes, where and when?<br>
  *Was the employer aware of  the problem; can the employer or another witness corroborate that the claimant  is a victim of domestic violence? <br>
  *Was an Order of Protection  sought? If not, why not? Was it granted; if yes, when? What are its provisions?  (Request a copy from the claimant)<br>
  While  an Order of Protection against an abuser can serve as one form of corroboration  of domestic violence, a recent Appeal Board decision illustrates an important  point about evaluating a claimant&rsquo;s failure to seek an order of protection:  &ldquo;Such a document clearly provides no guarantee of continued safety from an  individual with a proven history of violence and intimidation&rdquo;. (AB 529594A) <br>
  Failure  to seek an Order of Protection before quitting to relocate does not subject  claimant to a disqualification from benefits when other evidence establishes  that the claimant acted from genuine fear for her/his own personal safety or  the safety of children. &nbsp;As previously  recognized by the Appeal Board, an Order of Protection discourages an attack; it  does not prevent an attack (AB 448376).</p>
<p align="center"><u>RELOCATION OUT OF THE AREA</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  If claimant's leaving of  employment resulted from a decision to relocate out of the area, additional  considerations arise.<br>
  *Was the claimant's  decision to move out of the area based on one or more of these factors: <br>
  -fear  of remaining in proximity to the abuser, <br>
  -loss  of, or inability to afford prior residence<br>
  -other  financial constraints due to change in family <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; income (loss of child care, e.g.)<br>
  -  returning to the proximity of other family members<br>
  -requirement  of personal care (medical, psychological)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; by family member<br>
  -specific  recommendation by law enforcement or other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; professional.</p>

<p align="center"><u>THREATS, HARASSMENT, AND/OR ATTACKS AT THE WORKPLACE</u> </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  According to The Office <em>for the  Prevention of Domestic Violence, a NYS agency, 74% of working battered women  are harassed by their abusive partners on the job, frequently resulting in  absence from work, lateness, leaving early, and loss of employment. </em><br>
  Threats by domestic abusers  may take the form of repeated harassing contact at work, or stalking at or near  the workplace, even after a victim has left the home that was shared with the  abuser. Whether the contact is in person or by repeated phone calls, the intent  is to bully or intimidate. Such conduct would also raise a reasonable fear for  personal safety. <br>
  Additionally, in some  situations, violence or harassment at work may begin or increase after an  individual may have left the abuser and moved to a location not known to the  abuser; at this point harassment at work may increase. <br>
  In a recent case, a  claimant quit her job after having been repeatedly stalked at her place of  employment by her violent abusive ex-husband. She had been divorced from him  for ten years, during which there had been no contact because he did not know  where she relocated. She notified the police of his malingering; she tried to  alter her work schedule, but still observed him in the vicinity of her  employment. She quit to relocate out of state, the Appeal Board found that this  was with good cause (AB 530403). <br>
  Prior case law supports the  principle that a claimant who has a genuine and reasonable fear for personal  safety may have good cause to quit employment, if claimant has been assaulted  at the workplace (AB 420,231). <br>
  In another case, claimant  was separated from her husband for two years. He continued to threaten her life  at her job site and at her home, in spite of two protective orders obtained  from the court. The Appeal Board held that claimant's leaving was with good  cause (AB 404,527).<br>
  In another case, claimant  had an affair with a co-worker, and they had a child. The relationship then  ended. The co-worker harassed claimant on and off the job and physically  attacked him. Claimant filed a police report and advised the employer, who tried  to keep the co-worker away from claimant. The co-worker continued the  harassment, threats, and violent incidents. Claimant resigned after a request  for transfer was denied. He relocated to another state. The Appeal Board held  this to be a voluntary quit with good cause. (AB 446,920)</p>
<p align="center"><u>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT HOME BUT NOT AT THE WORKPLACE</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Where claimant has been a  victim of a crime that occurred off the job, at or near home, the decision to  relocate to an area beyond commuting distance is not automatically good cause  for quitting continuing employment (<u>Matter of Ollinger</u>, 176 AD 2d 433;  AB 425,175). <br>
  However, in a more recent case  involving domestic violence, the Appellate Division&rsquo;s ruling reversed the  Appeal Board&rsquo;s decision that the claimant must establish that she took steps both  to preserve her employment prior to quitting and to seek other housing locally.  In this case, the claimant who was pregnant had been subjected to actions of  her husband in which he would yell, scream, curse, bang on the walls on a daily  basis, and she was in fear for herself and her five year old son. Her husband  had visited her at her place of employment but not threatened her there. The  claimant, who was suffering from poor weight gain and sleeplessness, made a  plan to relocate out of the area, in order to be closer to her family. Her  obstetrician supported this decision. She filed for divorce, left New York and relocated  to a women&rsquo;s shelter in another state, closer to her sister. She took no steps  to safeguard her employment. The Court ruled that the record establishes that  the claimant&rsquo;s voluntary separation occurred as a consequence of circumstances  directly resulting from the claimant being a victim of domestic violence, and  found the claimant eligible. (<u>Matter of Loney</u>, 287 AD 2d 846)<br>
  This ruling supports the  analysis that when a victim of domestic violence has a genuine fear for  personal safety, and her abuser has been able to track her to her place of  employment, it is reasonable for her to make a decision to relocate out of the  area, without seeking to protect that employment. <br>
  Likewise, in a case where the  claimant was threatened with assault at the workplace by her abusive spouse,  she had cause to quit (AB 366,368). Claimant had frequently been beaten by her  husband despite calls to, and in the presence of, the police. Her husband had  threatened to come to the workplace, and had done so when claimant worked for a  prior employer. Claimant was urged by a counselor to relocate out of the area,  given the ineffectiveness of police.</p>
<p align="center"><u>ATTEMPTS TO RETAIN EMPLOYMENT</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Domestic violence is  different from many other kinds of crime because the victim is not a stranger  to the abuser, and may have had no reasonable option to protect herself or her  children other than relocating out of the area. Leaving one&rsquo;s home but not  one&rsquo;s job may not be adequate to provide sufficient distance from an abuser to  safeguard oneself from future threats or violence. In many instances, no  attempt to safeguard employment may have been made; in many cases involving  domestic violence, failure to make such efforts does not bar eligibility for  benefits. For example, in the <u>Loney</u> case discussed above, after being  beaten by her husband, the claimant filed for divorce and moved to a different  state where she would be closer to her sister. Although she made no efforts to  safeguard her employment, the Court ruled that the record established that the  claimant&rsquo;s voluntary separation occurred as a consequence of circumstances  directly resulting from the claimant being a victim of domestic violence, and  found the claimant eligible. <br>
  In another case, several  months before the last day worked, claimant left her husband who had physically  abused her. She obtained an Order of Protection. Subsequently, she had the  order withdrawn and moved back in with her husband. He resumed the abuse, and  began to appear at the workplace and abuse the claimant there. Claimant  requested a leave of absence to try to resolve the problem, but was denied.  Where a claimant has made a reasonable attempt to safeguard the employment by  requesting a leave of absence in order to resolve problems resulting from  domestic violence, her decision to quit in order to relocate out of the area  when the leave request was denied, was with good cause (AB 446,316).<br>
  In many instances, no  attempt to safeguard employment may have been made; in many cases involving  domestic violence, such steps would not have been reasonable.&nbsp; A victim of domestic violence, who fears for  her own safety or the safety of her children, may have been counseled by police  or other law enforcement or by victim services  providers to leave the locality. No request for a leave of absence would have  been reasonable if claimant had no intention to remain in the area. <br>
  Claimant's ability to take  these reasonable steps is, in itself, a factor to consider as well; evidence  from claimant's physician, therapist or counselor, or shelter workers or victim  services providers could be relevant  on this point. Statements or letters from a victim&rsquo;s lawyer or clergy member,  or hospital records might be provided to establish the circumstances within  which claimant acted.<br>
  While the actions of a  claimant who quits employment are appropriately evaluated against a standard of  &quot;what a reasonable person would have done,&quot; it should not be ignored  that claimant may have had to take immediate steps to address a crisis. The  experience of domestic violence can be characterized as a crisis. The specific  details about claimant's physical and psychological well being are relevant. In  limited circumstances, there may be a potential for a transfer to another  location with the same employer. In those instances, it is appropriate to  determine whether the claimant requested such a transfer. If not, why not? Was  there a concern about whether the employer would safeguard this information, or  would this have allowed the perpetrator a source of information as to the  victim&rsquo;s whereabouts?</p>
<p align="center"><u>ABSENCE FROM WORK AND LATENESS</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  It is also evident that  loss of employment due to circumstances arising from domestic violence takes  the form of discharge by the employer, due to chronic or prolonged absences or  lateness. Absence or lateness may be due to seeking medical help or counseling,  looking for emergency housing, or obtaining legal help or going to court. <br>
  The basic considerations in  these cases are:<br>
  *Was  the absence or lateness due to circumstances directly attributable to the abuse,  or other compelling circumstances?<br>
  *Did  claimant communicate with the employer? If not, why not?<br>
  The Appeal Board and the  Court have long held that a discharge from employment based on circumstances  beyond the claimant's control is not disqualifying. If the claimant was absent  because of injury or inability to work, which can be verified through medical  report, the remaining consideration is whether the claimant notified the  employer. Since a worker may have rights to job protection under the Family  Medical Leave Act, timely notification to the employer is an important  consideration.<br>
  New York State Penal Law  was amended to make it illegal to punish or fire an individual who is a victim  of a crime for taking off time to appear in court as a witness, to consult with  a district attorney, or to obtain an Order of Protection. The employer can  require the individual to provide proof that she/he was in court. (New York Penal Law  &sect;215.14).&nbsp; <br>
  A claimant who fails to  contact the employer when absent for even a short time, may be subject to  disqualification, if claimant does not have a compelling reason for failing to  call or failing to arrange to have the employer notified. If the claimant has a  specific reason for failing to communicate with the employer, it should be  evaluated in its context: for example, was claimant advised not to do so,  because of a failure by the employer to keep information about the claimant&rsquo;s  whereabouts confidential?</p>
<p align="center"> <br>
  <u>Availability  for work </u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  The issue of temporary unavailability for work may be evident in claims  filed by victims of domestic violence; personal circumstances may or may not  have been resolved to the point that the claimant is ready, willing and able to  seek and accept new employment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may  become evident that a period of unavailability has ended by the time the other  issues are adjudicated. It may be determined that the claimant is presently  unavailable; &nbsp;it would be appropriate to  advise the claimant to pursue the claim when the reason for unavailability has  been resolved.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <u>SUMMARY</u></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Case law and statutes  continue to evolve, to address the complexities of this issue, and the  Department of Labor will continue to monitor our handling of the Unemployment Insurance  claims that arise. <br>
  Separation from employment  cases resulting from circumstances involving domestic violence require careful and  compassionate fact finding to determine eligibility for benefits. In general,  numerous factors must be considered to evaluate whether claimant had a genuine  and reasonable fear for personal safety or the safety of other family members,  and whether any steps were possible to resolve the personal circumstances and  to safeguard employment. <br>
  Care should be take to the  extent possible to maintain confidentiality about the claimant&rsquo;s particular  circumstances. Specific details obtained from the claimant or representative  regarding domestic violence should not be disclosed to the other parties.<br>

<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL">WORK  WITHOUT PAY - LACK OF TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT </font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">This issue of lack of total unemployment can be one of the  most difficult issues facing personnel involved in the adjudication of Unemployment  Insurance claims.&nbsp; Clearly, claimants who  perform services under a contract of hire and receive remuneration for those  services lack total unemployment.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Increasingly, we discover cases where claimants receive no  remuneration but perform services under the guise of training. New York State  Law does not sanction the practice of people working without pay for the  benefit of employers under the guise of training.&nbsp; Per Article 19 of the New York State Labor  Law, individuals who perform services in employment must be paid at least  minimum wage for each hour worked.&nbsp;  Furthermore, overtime pay is required at the rate of one and one half  times the hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.&nbsp; Claimants who have performed such services  have the right to file a claim for payment of back wages with the Bureau of  Labor Standards Wages and Hours Division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">The lack of remuneration is not by itself determinative  evidence of total unemployment.&nbsp; Such  cases require careful scrutiny.&nbsp; The  Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board decisions discussed below reflect that  individuals performing such services for businesses would also be considered to  lack total unemployment.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  Claimants who perform unpaid work as &ldquo;training&rdquo; to establish  a new career, enhance their skills or in preparation for a professional license  or as a trainee pursuant to a contract of hire or based on an understanding  that the claimant may be hired upon successful completion of the training are  not totally unemployed.&nbsp; Individuals who  perform unpaid services as part of an employer&rsquo;s &ldquo;on the job training program&rdquo;  that is not part of a school program for academic credit are generally  considered to lack total unemployment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Exceptions do, however, exist and will be discussed later.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>UNPAID  ON THE JOB TRAINING</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">The Appeal Board has consistently upheld the principle that  claimants who want a career change and perform such unpaid services are considered not totally unemployed.&nbsp; For example: &nbsp;</font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A       claimant who previously worked as a dishwasher performed unpaid services       for a florist in order to receive training in floral design. He reported       to the employer&rsquo;s premises on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday between 9:00       a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and on Wednesday and Saturday between 9:00 a.m. and       12:00 p.m. He was found to lack total unemployment. (See A.B. 346,980).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A       claimant who worked at a restaurant without pay and received a free lunch       daily for a period of two weeks to learn how to become a bartender and       operate the employer&rsquo;s computer was found to be not totally unemployed.       (See A.B. 407,323).</font></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A       claimant who performed unpaid services as a waitress trainee three days       per week for five weeks was also found to lack total unemployment. (See A.B.       521,179).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>ENHANCING  SKILLS</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Additionally, the Appeal Board has held that individuals who  perform services without pay for the purpose of enhancing skills to improve  future employment prospects are considered not totally unemployed.&nbsp; For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">After being separated from his base period employer under       non-disqualifying circumstances, a senior research scientist was given the       title of &ldquo;Visiting Scientist&rdquo; without receiving a salary.&nbsp; He spent 16-18 hours per week at a       university conducting research and drafting articles.&nbsp; His only compensation was payment for       travel expenses incurred when he traveled to other research facilities       where he presented his work at conferences. The Appeal Board ruled that       this claimant was not totally unemployed while performing these services.       (See A.B. 462,609).</font></li>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who had completed a degree in biology who       volunteered his services to a state agency for the purpose of gaining       practical experience in his field lacked total unemployment. In this case,       the claimant assisted an aquatic biologist in netting fish, removing       fertilized eggs and kept statistics for the agency.&nbsp; He performed these services for five       weeks and later listed this employment on his resume. The Board sustained       our determination of lack of total unemployment.&nbsp; (See A.B. 326,668).</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>PREPARING  FOR PROFESSIONAL LICENSING EXAMS</u><br />
  Further, the Appeal Board has ruled  that individuals who perform services without salary in order to prepare for  professional licensing exams are not totally unemployed.&nbsp; For example:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">Claimants attended training under a  real estate brokers&rsquo; sponsorship to get ready for the required real estate  licensing exam.&nbsp; During this period, they  attended seminars and viewed training videos at the brokers&rsquo; premises.&nbsp; They also observed other salespersons&rsquo;  activities, answered telephones, called prospective clients to attempt to sell  properties.&nbsp; The Appeal Board upheld the  principle that the time devoted to these unpaid activities constituted  employment.&nbsp; (See A.B.186, 227F, A B.  377,218 and A.B. 395,095).</font></li>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">In a similar decision, the Board held the  claimant was not totally unemployed while in training to prepare for insurance  licensing exams in New York and Pennsylvania.&nbsp; He was present at the broker&rsquo;s premises and  made a sale under his valid New    Jersey insurance license, taking out a policy on his  own family for which he received a commission.&nbsp;  He was required to purchase study materials and received a training  allowance.&nbsp; He subsequently received his  additional licenses and began full time employment for this insurance  agency.&nbsp; The Board found the claimant not  totally unemployed for the duration of the training program. (See A B. 393,658  A). &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who performed services as an unpaid apprentice at a funeral home  on a full time basis to satisfy a residency required by New York State Health Department  requirements and to complete his degree in mortuary science was held to be both  not totally unemployed and not available for employment (A.B. 451,607). &nbsp;It should be noted that the apprenticeship was  not connected with any school program. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>PARTICIPATION  IN A NATIONAL DOMESTIC SERVICE PROGRAM</u></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who performed services for a  national domestic service program, Americorps, in exchange for an allowance to  cover living expenses and post service educational benefits was found to lack  total unemployment per ALJ # 104-04119 (Please note that this case was not  appealed). &nbsp;</font></li>

<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>RECEIPT  OF COMPENSATION OTHER THAN CASH</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Claims issues sometimes arise when a claimant performs  services without pay in exchange for something of value other than cash.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">The following discussion of Unemployment Insurance Appeal  Board cases illustrates the distinction between substantial services which  would render a claimant not totally unemployed and casual services which would  render a claimant to be totally unemployed when performing unpaid services as a  favor.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who assisted the owner of a  restaurant by performing catering services as a favor to offset an old debt was  found to lack total unemployment (see A.B. 493,631).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">&nbsp;A claimant who stopped by his uncle&rsquo;s bar and  grill for a sandwich and beer two or three times per week and performed unpaid  services including changing beer kegs, carrying cases of beer, clearing  glasses, sweeping, cashing out customers, and grilling the occasional burger  before a cook was hired was not totally unemployed (see A.B. 522,883).</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who performed services at  his sister&rsquo;s store as a salesperson for four hours per day in exchange for room  and board afforded by his sister was not totally unemployed (see A.B. 359,411).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who swept floors, took care  of trash disposal, restocked the refrigerator, and helped in other jobs without  any compensation other than receiving free beer at a bar owned by a close  friend was found to lack total unemployment (see A.B. 295,731A). </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant performed services for his  former employer, a flight school, during a period when business was slow. He  sold equipment, enrolled students, and witnessed waivers signed by prospective  students three times a week. These were the same duties he performed while on  payroll.&nbsp; In return, he received free use  of the landing field and a discount on merchandise he bought in the employer&rsquo;s  store.&nbsp; He was found to lack total  unemployment (see A.B. 364,709).&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>FAVORS</u> </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Claims issues can sometimes involve  claimants who perform unpaid services as favors. Careful fact finding as to the  nature of these services is required to determine whether or not a lack of  total unemployment exists.&nbsp; It is necessary  to ascertain what specific services are being performed, how often they are  being performed, and how much time is spent on these activities in order to  make the proper determination on the issue of total unemployment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">The following discussion of  Unemployment Insurance Appeal cases illustrates the distinction between substantial  services that would render a claimant not totally unemployed and casual  services that would render a claimant totally unemployed. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant assisted his /her spouse,  who was a Family Care Provider, by sharing in domestic chores and lending a hand  to the residents in their home as a matter of common courtesy was found to be  totally unemployed.&nbsp; The spouse was not a  licensed home care provider.&nbsp; For a  complete discussion of this case, please see A-750-2037.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who performed occasional and  gratuitous services for his brother was totally unemployed.&nbsp; In this case, claimant only helped out  occasionally and he did not receive any type of compensation for his services  (see A-750-70).&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A claimant who rendered substantial  services twice a week for one to three hours per day for her brother&rsquo;s produce  business was not totally unemployed.&nbsp;  Claimant opened the store, helped customers, and used the cash register  (see A.B. 407,511).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">There are exceptions to the general  rule. There are certain situations where a claimant may perform services without pay and still be considered totally  unemployed. For example:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>WORK  RELIEF</u></font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">Claimants       who receive public assistance are sometimes required to perform services       for government or non-profit agencies in a work relief program pursuant to       New York State Social Services Law.&nbsp;       These individuals are not performing these services under a       contract of hire and are not on any employer payroll.&nbsp; Therefore, they are totally       unemployed.&nbsp; They are also held to       be available for employment unless there is no reasonable effort to make       job efforts when not performing services under the work relief program. For       a complete discussion of this particular topic, please refer to Field       Memorandum 6-83. </font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>SKILL  TRAINING</u></font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">Clients       of VESID (Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with       Disabilities) who are referred to short term on the job training programs       operated by non-profit organizations designed to assist them in overcoming       disabilities and to improve their skills in order to improve their chances       of obtaining work are totally unemployed despite the receipt of a minimal       cash payment.&nbsp; This payment is       considered an incentive to develop skills that would lead to employment.&nbsp; It should be noted that these claimants       were free to accept employment during the entire duration of the training       program.&nbsp; Claimants are considered       to be available while attending this type of program. (See A-750-1966).</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">The       Appeal Board also held that services rendered to the Salvation Army as a client       who was reconditioning furniture for resale in return for room and board       and a small cash grant did not come within the definition of employment as       the payments made to claimant were assistance during a period of need as       distinguished from wages for employment, the services were incidental to       such relief and the claimant could leave at any time.&nbsp; Please see A-750-897 for a full       discussion of this case.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>&nbsp;</u></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>VOLUNTEER  WORK</u></font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">A       claimant performing volunteer work for a charitable, religious,       educational or cultural organization is totally unemployed and available       for employment provided that these services do not interfere with job       search requirements or the claimant&rsquo;s readiness, willingness or ability to       work.&nbsp; The volunteer duties must not       be so time-consuming as to prevent the claimant from seeking employment       diligently or accepting suitable employment.&nbsp; (Please see Field Memorandum 11-82 for a       complete discussion of this issue).</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>INTERNSHIP  PROGRAMS</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="ARIEL">Students       who perform unpaid services as part of an internship program offered by a       school or training facility for academic credit and completed under the       supervision of a school or training facility and subject to evaluation by       the training facility are totally unemployed.&nbsp; Training approval under Section 599 of       the Unemployment Insurance law should be considered. If the internship       does not meet the established standards for training approval, then the       claimant would still be considered totally unemployed and available for       employment for the entire duration of the internship if the claimant is       ready, willing and able to work, is prepared to discontinue the training       course if a suitable job opportunity is offered, and makes reasonable job       efforts (see A-710-45, Section A). &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>&nbsp;</u></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>UNPAID  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Pursuant to A-710-45 Section B, a claimant is considered  totally unemployed when participating in an unpaid, pre-employment training  program of short duration, without remuneration and such training is not subject  to a contract of hire. </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">A prime example would be a claimant who is participating in  an apprenticeship training program that does not meet the criteria for training  approval under the 599 program.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">This may include activities such as attending a job  interview that includes a tour and orientation conducted by the prospective  employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Other examples may include a claimant&rsquo;s attendance at  training sessions or seminars conducted by Dept. of Employment Services.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>EXPLORING  THE FEASIBILITY OF STARTING A BUSINESS</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Questions sometimes arise regarding when a claimant who is  considering starting a business begins to explore the feasibility of such a  venture.&nbsp; Such exploration may include  but may not be limited to enrolling in courses and seminars on the subject of  how to start a business, conducting market research, meeting with a banker to  discuss financial options and availability of capital for the venture.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">An individual who is merely trying to investigate the  possibility of starting a business but have not yet made any financial  commitments to the venture should still be considered totally unemployed.&nbsp; In this situation, personnel adjudicating  claims should also investigate the issues of availability and training approval  per Section 599. Please see Field Memorandum 3-93 and Review Letter 2-94 for  further information of this subject.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>&nbsp;</u></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="ARIEL"><u>SUMMARY</u></font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">There is a need for careful fact finding when making  determinations in these types of cases.&nbsp;  The following factors need to be considered:</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Why and for whom is the claimant performing services without  pay? What services are being performed?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant working without pay in order to change  careers, enhance skills or qualify for a professional license?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant performing services without compensation as  part of an employer&rsquo;s on the job training program with the understanding that  the claimant will be hired for a job upon successful completion of the  traineeship?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant performing services in exchange for  something of value?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant performing unpaid services as a favor?&nbsp; If so, what services are being performed and  how much time is devoted to these activities? </font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">&nbsp;Is the unpaid work  being performed by claimant who is participating in an internship program which  is offered for credit by a training facility?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Are the unpaid services done pursuant to a work relief  program?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant working for a government or non-profit  organization based on a referral from VESID?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is claimant a client of a non-profit agency and renders services  in return for assistance?</font></p>
<p><font face="ARIEL">Is the claimant performing services without pay for a  charitable, religious, educational or cultural organization?&nbsp; If so, is claimant able to seek and accept  suitable employment?</font></p>

GENERAL</B></BIG></CENTER>
<P></P><BR><BR><A name=intro></A>
<P><B>I. <U>Introduction:</B></P></U>
<P>This Review Letter serves as a general summary and guide to Nonmonetary 
Determinations. It describes the identification of issues and their correct 
resolution according to Federal criteria and New York State Unemployment 
Insurance Law, Rules and Regulations. In future updates this release will be 
modified with revised pages instead of reprinting it entirely. This method of 
updating, similar to the Interpretation Service, allows more frequent and timely 
notices to staff as program changes occur.</P>
<P>This edition incorporates changes in NMD processes due to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>UI Reform Legislation in New York State (1998)
  <P></P>
  <LI>USDOL’s amended Federal definitions of Nonmonetary activities issued 
  during the "UI Performs" project (1996)
  <P></P>
  <LI>NYS "Reasonable Attempts" standards for fact-finding (1997)
  <P></P>
  <LI>NMD activities at Telephone Claims Centers (TCCs) using voice-response and 
  imaging-system technologies 
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P>NMD adjudications must fulfill three basic workload concepts: Reportability, 
Validity and Quality. Consistency among claims staff is essential in order that 
work units be reported accurately and fully. The failure to recognize and 
develop legitimate nonmonetary issues can result in an under-funding of the 
program. </P>
<P>The quality of the NMD process is measured by the "Benefits, Time-lapse and 
Quality" (BTQ)program, where a sample of NMD decisions is reviewed each calendar 
quarter for the quality of fact-finding and conformity of the decision to State 
Law and Policy and the time lapse between issue identification and its 
resolution. </P>
<P>It is of the utmost importance that DOL staff be able to identify nonmonetary 
issues. A major identification of issues is through the original claim process. 
The claimstaker must recognize all issues presented by the claimant in claim 
filing, so that further fact-finding can occur. Other areas where issues may 
appear include Additional Claims, PEER and other interviews, the certification 
to benefits, job referral activities, etc.</P><!-- <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">REVIEW LETTER 2-2001               ONE-1                   March, 2001</P> -->
<P>Not all eligibility questions recognized will result in valid NMDs; some are 
merely routine "claims taking." The job of the LSR (claims adjudicator)is to 
determine if an issue exists and, if so, to investigate and resolve it. In some 
instances all that may be necessary is some clarification of the claimant’s 
statements. Such routine fact-finding, which does not identify an issue, is not 
a nonmonetary activity. </P>
<P>But in other cases, the failure to develop a valid NMD is the result of 
inadequate fact-finding, not considering all the ramifications of the 
information developed, or failing to record the work actually done. </P><A 
name=Definition></A>
<P><B>II. <U>Definition of a Nonmonetary Determination (NMD</U>)</B></P>
<P>In 1996 USDOL revised the criteria for reporting Nonmonetary Determinations, 
and adjusted its funding process to equate increased workload levels for states 
that began to report certain activities formerly considered invalid and 
non-reportable, such as:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>NMDs issued in the absence of a week claimed
  <P></P>
  <LI>More than one NMD based on the same set of facts
  <P></P>
  <LI>Discharge cases due to inability to perform the job
  <P></P>
  <LI>Crossmatch determinations arising from Benefit Payment Control/Fraud 
  Detection work not previously included on the Federal ETA 207 NMD workload 
  report
  <P></P></LI></UL><A name=USDOL></A>
<P>A. <U>USDOL Criteria for Valid NMDs</U></P>
<DIR>
<P>USDOL’s definition of a Nonmonetary Determination now has only two parts: 
there must be an issue affecting available benefit rights, and an eligibility 
determination must be made. A Nonmonetary Determination is defined as:</P>
<DIR>
<P>A DECISION MADE BY THE CLAIMS ADJUDICATOR BASED ON FACTS RELATED TO AN 
"ISSUE" DETECTED:</P></DIR>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>WHICH HAD THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE CLAIMANT’S PAST, PRESENT, OR 
    FUTURE BENEFIT RIGHTS; AND
    <P></P>
    <LI>FOR WHICH A DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY WAS MADE. </LI></UL></UL></DIR>
<P>To ensure the above criteria are met, the following terms must be clearly 
understood:</P><B>
<P>ISSUE</B>: An act, circumstance, or condition potentially disqualifying under 
State law or the Commissioner’s rules and regulations.</P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001                  ONE-2            March, 2001</P> --><B>
<P>BENEFIT RIGHTS</B>: Monetary entitlement established by an appealable 
agency-document (monetary determination) that explains the amount and 
computation of potential rights to benefits. A claimant has no benefit rights to 
be affected by an NMD until monetary entitlement is first established. </P><B>
<P>SINGLE AND MULTI-CLAIMANT NMDs</B>: Nonmonetary determinations may apply to 
one or more claimants. The single-claimant nonmonetary determination is based 
upon facts which relate to an individual situation, and is issued to a single 
claimant. Multi-claimant nonmonetary determinations have a set of facts which 
apply to groups of workers similarly situated, each of whom is issued the same 
notice of determination. Because identical facts and decisions apply, one 
multi-claimant NMD is counted for the group, although the total number of 
claimants issued the notice is also reported.</P><A name=NMD></A>
<P>B. <U>NMD Documentation Requirements</P></U>
<P>The following specific data must appear on identifiable documents to show 
that an NMD meets the above definitional requirements to be properly counted as 
a nonmonetary determination:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The issue and potentially disqualifying facts must be recorded.
  <P></P>
  <LI>The material facts considered in arriving at the determination must be 
  recorded, including "Reasonable Attempts" made to seek any necessary 
  information that could not be obtained.
  <P></P>
  <LI>The conclusion of law and legal result supported by the factual basis must 
  be clearly documented to show whether the claim was allowed or denied.

<P>C. <U>Illustrations of Valid NMD Counts</P></U>
<P>Examples of valid Single-Claimant Nonmonetary Determinations:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Separation issues, which are potentially disqualifying circumstances 
  surrounding the loss of a job, either by voluntary quit or discharge. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Nonseparation issues, such as being unavailable for work, and incapable of 
  work, failure to certify as required, the attendance at training, etc. 
<BR><BR>
  <LI>Determinations made because of fraud and misrepresentation, except that no 
  count may be taken for a notice of overpayment when the reason for the 
  overpayment was issued on a separately counted nonmonetary determination.

<P>There are many other situations dealt with in this Review Letter that could 
produce an NMD, but the following circumstances are NEVER reportable as NMD 
workload:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Routine exploration of fact, questioning, or advising claimants when no 
  element of controversy is present or discovered. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Clerical postings on electronic files such as routing information noted in 
  the Imaging workflow process. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Referrals to the Investigation Section are not countable as NMDs when 
  pre-referral fact-finding fails to uncover potentially disqualifying 
  information and no determination on the facts is made. The investigation 
  Section will count any NMDs they make after completing their findings. For 
  example, if a ‘tip’ is received about concealed employment and the matter is 
  referred for field investigation, the LSR isn’t making an NMD, as the material 
  facts to prove or refute the allegation haven’t yet been obtained. The claims 
  adjudicator should not count an "NTU" eligible determination, even though 
  benefits are not being denied. However, a valid NMD may be taken on the NTU 
  issue if pre-referral fact finding does uncover potentially disqualifying 
  information and the claims adjudicator determines the claimant eleigible but 
  requests additional field investigation. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Correction of certification errors (for example, days worked, holiday or 
  vacation pay, availability and capability issues) when the claimant volunteers 
  the information and the office agrees a mistake was made. There is no 
  contention or controversy and no facts are in dispute; therefore no count can 
  be taken, even if an overpayment results. <BR><BR>

<DIR>

although monetary entitlement must still be established before adjudication

<P>G. <U>Adjudication Policy "Poor Performance"</P></U>
<P>Confusion often arises about cases where claimants were discharged because 
they did not perform adequately on the job. Some fact-finding is usually 
required to distinguish among "Proficiency", "Performance", and "Not Qualified" 
cases, which are not always due to simple inaptitude or lack of 
qualifications/ability to do the job. But there can be an NMD only in situations 
where there is an "issue" developed or in which initial statements of either 
party <U>do not rule out</U> possible disqualifying circumstances.</P><B>
<P>In contrast, if the claimant is incapable of meeting the employer's standards 
through no fault of his own, there is no issue of Misconduct, and there is no 
valid NMD, even after thorough investigation</B>.</P>
<P>Since "Misconduct" is not specifically defined in the statute, this type of 
case needs further investigation according to precedents in existing case law. 
The investigation must always produce MORE INFORMATION, and SPECIFIC FACTS 
related to possible Misconduct. In cases where additional facts and evidence are 
needed to reasonably assure a correct decision, the LSR must perform necessary 
fact-finding and then issue a determination. </P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001       ONE-6                       March, 2001</P> -->
<P><U>Initial Fact-Finding</U>: <U>Claimant's Deficiencies and Work 
History</U></P>
<P>In adjudicating such cases LSR staff must examine and document the type of 
performance problem that occurred and form conclusions as to:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Whether the performance deficiency was caused by some specific behavior 
    or a neglect of duties? <BR><BR>
    <LI>Was there opportunity or warning or employer assistance to effect 
    improvements? <BR><BR>
    <LI>Why wasn’t the claimant able to improve his or her 
performance?</LI></UL></UL>
<P>This investigation is conducted in order to obtain facts about the specific 
claimant behavior or causes that the employer observed before making the 
conclusion to discharge the claimant for his "poor performance". A sequence of 
questions helps to distinguish situations that could involve misconduct from 
those which do not: How long did claimant do that job? Did he ever do it better? 
When did his performance become inadequate, or was it always the same? </P>
<P>When the employer identified the problems with the claimant’s performance, 
did they confront him? Re-instruct him? Re-train? Warn him? (how?) Did the 
claimant resist the instruction, or did he cooperate? Did the claimant appear to 
be following whatever instructions he was given, at least to the best of his 
ability? A brief statement that only repeats the phrase "poor performance" 
establishes that there was "no issue" i.e. the employer agrees there was no 
misconduct situation involved no NMD results. </P>
<P><U>Further Questions: When Employer Contends Claimant was able to and should 
have performed adequately</U></P>
<P>When it is alleged that the claimant did <U>not</U> try to meet expected 
standards, <B>an issue exists</B> and the employer should be asked further 
questions:</P>
<P>What did the employer observe that led him to conclude either the claimant 
was not trying to improve, or deliberately performed poorly? Did the claimant 
ever say anything that led the employer to believe that the poor work was 
intentional? </P>
<P>Answers to the second group of questions help the LSR reach a conclusion 
about whether there was in fact a <U>pattern of behavior</U> that should be 
regarded as misconduct and disqualify the claimant from receiving benefits. The 
LSR should in all such cases develop <U>facts</U> from which a conclusion 
(rationale) can be stated regarding possible misconduct. To count a valid NMD, 
possibly disqualifying information must be explored, obtained, rebutted and 
documented.</P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001            ONE-7               March, 2001</P> -->
<P>Poor performance that is the result of deliberate neglect of duties, 
disregard of instructions, or gross neglect is Misconduct, and must be 
evaluated. "Poor Performance" should be adjudicated whenever it is contended 
that inability or incapability of meeting the standards of work was not the 
cause of discharge.</P>
<P>It should always be made clear in the file WHY the LSR felt an issue existed 
and what further investigation was needed, i.e. the employer’s LO 400 noted a 
contested claim or a claimant self-reports a disqualifying circumstance. </P>
<P>When such cases of "Poor Performance" are properly investigated and 
documented, they now meet Federal and State standards for reportability. In 
contrast, when further investigation is NOT needed, policy in our state 
continues to be that when both parties gave CLEARLY non-disqualifying separation 
information, merely advising the employer of claimant’s eligibility on an LO 21 
form does not constitute a reportable NMD.</P><A name=Possibly></A>

<P>It is extremely important that the NMD documentation shows why and when the 
issue was referred for further fact-finding. The claim documents or electronic 
records must always include the source of information about which the claimant 
was questioned. To finalize the NMD decision an NMD "Source Code" has to be 
entered by the claims adjudicator, along with the issue "Detection Date" and the

Summary Screen under "CLAIM-DATE."</P>
<P>If no issue exists at the time a claim is filed but possibly disqualifying

<P>When an issue is indicated through Tel-Service, the issue is considered 
detected the first date a computer control stops payment. During normal business 
hours, the detection date is that same day. If the certification is recorded 
after normal business hours, the detection date is the next business day after 
the claimant certifies. This date can be determined by viewing the Automated

  <P>Every case record must contain all the necessary facts, or show that an 
  attempt was made to get them, from any party whose statements are material to 
  deciding the claimant’s eligibility. It is this collective evidence that the 
  LSR considers in order to reach the conclusions of law reflected in an NMD.  </P>
  <P>If the LSR lacks any relevant and critical information to begin with, it is 
  quite possible that an incorrect decision would occur, despite best efforts to 
  evaluate the case. Furthermore, it is a due process right to afford the 
  parties an opportunity to submit relevant information before making the NMD, 
  to make them aware of administrative deadlines for supplying this information, 
  and to tell them of consequences for failing to reply in time. In the 
  investigation of claims it is the Agency’s responsibility to take the 
  initiative in the discovery of information. This responsibility may not be 
  passed on to the claimant or the employer. If the information obtained from 
  other sources differs essentially from that furnished by the claimant, the 
  Agency is required to inform the claimant of such information from other 
  sources and to afford the claimant an opportunity to furnish any further facts 
  or rebuttal he/she may have. This applies to the employer as well.</P>
  <P>The claims adjudicator must take an active role in adjudicating issues. 
  Adjudicators must not infer that it is solely the employer’s responsibility in 
  a misconduct case to prove a disqualification is warranted. Similarly, it is 
  the LSR’s responsibility to determine if good cause exists for a voluntary 
  leaving, once the claimant has specified his/her reasons. It is the LSR’s duty 
  to obtain material facts and offer the opportunity for rebuttal to all 
  relevant parties before making the determination. A valid determination can 
  only be made after all interested parties have been provided the opportunity 
  to present relevant facts and been allowed to offer appropriate rebuttal. </P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001           ONE-11               March, 2001</P> -->
  <P>However, there are times when reasonable attempts to obtain sufficiently 
  detailed information from the interested parties are unsuccessful. In such 
  instances, the written determination should cite the attempts that were 
  made.</P>
  <P>It is the claims adjudicator's responsibility to pursue, discover, and 
  determine the reason for the claimant’s separation, to make findings of fact 
  with respect to the separation, and then apply the law. The claims adjudicator

  pursue the facts of the case. The "burden" is really on the LSR to elicit the

    <P>If new information is obtained on an issue that refutes the claimant’s 
    statements, as for example, the employer has indicated that the claimant 
    quit as opposed to the claimant’s statements that he/she was "fired", the

    proper documentation be made. In cases where there is no essential 
    disagreement about the type of issue involved, and only one party has 
    furnished a timely reply to the information request or questionnaire, the 
    LSR may issue the NMD once the period allowed for reply to the fact-finding 
    attempt has ended. The examples below illustrate this.</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>A claims adjudicator leaves a message on claimant’s answering machine 
      at 3:00 PM on Monday to request a return call by 3:00 PM Wednesday. The 
      lapse of the 48-hour dead-line should be documented. <BR><BR>
      <LI>An employer reports a job refusal to the TCC. The adjudicator 
      unsuccessfully attempts to call the claimant (no answer or recorded 
      message). A "call-back" letter is then sent requesting claimant to reply 
      by telephone "immediately but no later than 3:00 p.m." on the fifth day 
      after mailing (day 1). The correct deadline date to give claimant on the 
      call-back card is as follows: 
      <P>If the notice is mailed Monday, the deadline is 3:00 p.m. Friday(fifth 
      day). If mailed Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, response is due by the 
      following Monday at 3:00 p.m. In each case Monday is the first business 
      day satisfying a five calendar-day deadline). A notice mailed Friday must 
      be responded to by 3:0 p.m. Tuesday (fifth calendar day). In each of these 
      deadlines a 3:00 p.m. time limit MUST be specified to permit phone and fax

  Employment after which the claimant did NOT have subsequent earnings of 5 
  times the rate is considered to be "controlling employment", i.e. the NMD 
  outcome controls whether or not claimant is eligible to receive benefits. If 
  the employment is ‘non-controlling’ for eligibility purposes, NMDs are 
  reportable if there is a potential effect on claimant’s benefit rights, i.e. 
  employment determined to have ended due to misconduct or a criminal act cannot 
  be used to qualify for benefits.</P>
  <P>B. <U>Notices Not Reportable as NMDs</U></P>
  <P>UI Reform brought about several changes in the notices sent to employers to 
  explain why claimants were found eligible based on the new principles of 
  controlling employment:</P>
  <P><U>Form CE52</U> – An informational notice (issued with ‘N’ count) to 
  advise a non-controlling employer that a VQ NMD is not being made because 
  there are subsequent earnings to break any potential disqualification that 
  might be imposed.</P>
  <P><U>Form CE53</U> – Eligible notice (issued with ‘N’ count) to a non-base 
  period, non controlling, employer on a separation issue that states the 
  employer’s wages were not in the base period, claimant had sufficient later 
  employment to break any disqualification that might have been imposed, and the 
  employer is not responsible for any benefit charges on the claim.</P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER  2-2001                 TWO-1               December,2000 </P> -->
  <P><U>Form MC99</U> - A notice (issued with an "N" count) which advises a 
  non-controlling base period employer that wages earned from employment have 
  been cancelled due to Misconduct and the employer will not be charged for 
  benefits although the claimant was found eligible based on subsequent 
  controlling employment.</P>
  <P>Whenever a disqualification is made regarding Misconduct or Voluntary Quit 
  Without Good Cause, the wages involved must be marked or tagged by the claims 
  adjudicator so that they will be properly used or eliminated from the current 
  and subsequent claims (see III 6990-3)</P><A name=Defining></A><B>
  <LI><U>Defining and Adjudicating Potential Misconduct</U></B> 
  <P>The employer or claimant will sometimes submit forms or questionnaires that 
  do not have enough detail to confirm the existence of an issue. The LSR must 
  first ascertain whether or not there <U>is</U> a benefits "issue", before 
  taking further steps to make a determination. It is imperative, in the less 
  obvious situations, that the LSR uncover the known facts and decide if they 
  present an issue to rule upon. Below are situations where exploratory or 
  clarification fact-finding must precede a more detailed investigation required 
  for an NMD count.</P><A name=Precipitating></A>
  <P>A. "<U>Precipitating" and "Last" Incidents</U></P>
  <P>The term "last incident" can also be misleading. This is a term which has 
  been widely used in UI but sometimes sends LSR staff off in the wrong 
  direction (see Review Letter 2-84). In misconduct cases, it is the obligation 
  of the LSR to determine the "precipitating incident", i.e. that circumstance 
  which was the immediate cause of the employer’s decision to terminate the 
  claimant. Frequently the "last incident" is not the precipitating incident. 
  Thus, it is not uncommon for LSRs in an absenteeism and tardiness case to ask 
  an employer for the last incident of absence or tardiness, only to discover 
  later in the claim process that the decision to terminate had already been 
  made prior to the final occurrence of absence or tardiness. The "precipitating 
  incident" or "determining factor" are better descriptions of the heart of a 
  separation matter – that situation or event which caused the decision to be 
  made to terminate the claimant. If there is no single event or incident, the 
  LSR must go into the pattern or history of problems which led up to the 
  decision to discharge. </P><A name=Not></A>
  <P>B. <U>"Not Qualified" Situations</U> </P>
  <P>To say a person is "not qualified" strongly implies inability or 
  incapability to do the work, which are <U>not</U> eligibility issues. This is 
  not the same as "Poor Performance" on the job, which is discussed <!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001               TWO-2              March, 2001</P> -->in 
  Unit One, II-G. A valid NMD count may be taken in "not qualified" separation 
  situations <U>only</U> if either claimant or the employer indicates that a 
  possibly disqualifying act occurred which led to the claimant’s separation.  </P>
  <P>No bona fide issue exists when on the application for benefits the claimant 
  reports "not qualified for position", "could not make quota", "employer 
  unhappy with my production", etc. and the employer also replies "not 
  qualified" or words to that effect. Since both parties gave non-disqualifying 
  information, there is no bona fide issue. Similarly, if claimant answers 
  "fired" on the application for benefits and the employer reports either "lack 
  of work" or "not qualified," no NMD may be counted. </P><A 
  name=Non-conclusive></A>
  <P>C. <U>Non-conclusive employer information</U></P>
  <P>Separation information may be received from employers which does not 
  clearly indicate misconduct but which nevertheless is possibly disqualifying 
  because it raises an issue of whether the claimant was discharged for 
  misconduct. Investigation of such claims can generate reportable 
  determinations. Examples of employer replies which would require further 
  investigation to determine whether or not individuals may be disqualified 
  under the misconduct provisions in State law include: "discharged", "fired", 
  "dismissed", "terminated", "personality conflict" or "unsatisfactory" without 
  further explanation. Since the employer is the "moving party" initiating the 
  separation from employment, the employer is the first, and usually best, 
  source to obtain clarifying information. If the initial contact with the 
  employer indicates clearly that the reason for discharge is not disqualifying, 
  no NMD may be counted. This is clarification fact-finding. If, however, 
  potentially disqualifying information is obtained and additional substantive 
  fact-finding is needed to evaluate the reason for discharge, an NMD situation 
  exists.</P>
  <P><U>Example</U> - The employer responds on form LO 400 that the claimant was 
  discharged due to absenteeism. The employer is contacted by the claims 
  adjudicator and provides the following information: The last day of work was 
  January 7, 2000. The last absence for which the claimant was terminated was 
  December 7, 1999. The reason the claimant was not terminated until January 7, 
  2000 was that they did not feel they could terminate the claimant during the 
  holiday season.</P>
  <P>Since there was no direct relation of the offense to the discharge, a 
  determination of eligibility was made without interviewing the claimant. This 
  action met the requirements for a non monetary determination.</P><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001            TWO-3                   March, 2001      </P> --><A 
  name=Voluntary></A><B>
  <LI><U>Voluntary Quit</U></B> 
  <P>As a result of the amendments to the law, all controlling voluntary quits 
  must be adjudicated. Any voluntary leaving of the last employment prior to the 
  filing of an original or additional claim for benefits will be controlling, as 
  discussed above. In addition, any voluntary leaving of employment after which 
  claimant has had subsequent covered employment, but has not had earnings at 
  least equal to five times the benefit rate will also be controlling. The 
  adjudication of such issue can result in valid NMDs.</P>
  <P>However, no "issue" arises from the voluntary leaving of employment after 
  which, and before filing a claim for benefits, claimant has had subsequent 
  employment and earnings at least equal to five times the benefit rate. This is 
  equally true for Original Claims and Additional claims.</P>
  <P>Any employer objection involving a non-controlling voluntary quit must 
  result in a response to the employer, but this response will not constitute a 
  valid non-monetary determination, since no decision on the merits of the cause 
  for the quit is being made.</P>
  <P>When it has been determined that after a voluntary quit, the claimant has 
  had subsequent employment in which claimant has earned more than five times 
  the benefit rate prior to filing, the voluntary quit has no potential impact 
  on the claimant's right to benefits. It no longer meets the definition of "an 
  issue", which is necessary for validity of an NMD. </P><A 
  name=Situations></A><B>
  <LI><U>Situations Not Requiring Interview</U></B> 
  <P>It is possible in some separation issues to make a decision and have a 
  valid NMD count without interviewing the claimant. This can occur when the 
  claimant provides possibly disqualifying information and the employer upon 
  interview confirms a non-disqualifying reason for separation.</P>
  <DIR><U>
  <P>Example</U> – Claimant, a painter, stated he quit his job because his 
  employer was deducting $50 a week from his paycheck. The claimant provided 
  specific details about how he had painted a room the wrong color and the job 
  had to be done over. The employer was called and he confirmed the claimant's 
  statement and added, "this is the second time this guy upset one of my best 
  customers by making a mistake." This constitutes an illegal deduction from the 
  claimant's salary and is a quit with good cause, although claimant may have 
  been grossly negligent in making the mistake (see Field Memo 
2-2000).</P></DIR><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 3-200              TWO-4                  March, 2001</P> -->
  <P>In this example, there was possibly disqualifying information which was 
  resolved and a determination issued. If these elements are lacking, the NMD 
  count is invalid. If the facts presented prior to the beginning of the 
  fact-finding process raise an issue, we must define that issue, investigate 
  the facts consistent with our definitions and issue a written determination to 
  the adversely affected party. Prior to issuing such a determination that party 
  should be given the opportunity to rebut any new information upon which we 
  rely in making our determination. </P></LI></OL><!-- <P>REVIEW LETTER 2-2001            TWO-5                      March, 2001</P> --><BR>

<P>January 2001</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the calendar year 2000, one rule was distributed for the 
Interpretation Service, by release A-750-2112. This rule and the comments from 
the release are reprinted in this Review Letter. An <B>IMPORTANT UPDATE</B> was 
added to these. See <B>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS</B> within.</P>
<P>In April, an extensive 13 page Interpretation Service publication was 
released that contained changes and updates necessitated by the numerous recent 
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Law.</P>
<P>There were also two Field Memoranda released in 2000. The first discusses 
changes to Sections 527, 590, 534, 593.2 and 600.7 of the statute that were 
signed into law on February 15, 2000. The second, entitled Labor Standards 
Violations, contains a discussion of the most common types of violations that 
arise in unemployment insurance cases, as well as a chart that provides 
telephone numbers and jurisdictional information for Labor Standards offices in 
the state.</P>

<P><U>TIMELINESS</U></P>
<UL><U>
  <P>Hearing Request Receipt Date</P></U></UL>
<P>The timeliness of a hearing request must be measured by the date it was filed 
with the Commissioner of Labor, and this is established by the date it is 
received.</P><U>
<P align=center>COMMENTS</P></U>
<OL>
  <LI>Section 620 of the Unemployment Insurance Law limits the amount of time 
  that a party has to request a hearing on a determination, to thirty days. 
  However, neither the statute nor applicable regulations define the method by 
  which compliance with the time limit is measured.
  <P></P>
  <LI>In the <U>Matter of Levine</U>, cited by the Appeal Board in this 
  decision, the Court ruled that the mere mailing of a hearing request within 
  the allowed time period was insufficient to meet the statutory requirement. In 
  order to be timely, the request must be "filed with the Commissioner of Labor" 
  within thirty days.
  <P></P>
  <LI>This decision by the Appeal Board establishes that a request for hearing 
  is "filed" on the date it is received by the Commissioner. The evidence of 
  receipt is the instamp date marked on the letter by the local office. This is 
  the date to be entered as the hearing request date on the "Hearing Request 
  Information" screen.
  <P></P><U>
  <P align=center>UPDATED COMMENTS</P></U>
  <LI>Although <U>Matter of Levine</U> is current case law, recent Appeal Board 
  decisions (not published) have pointed out that the instructions on notices of 
  determination states:" request must be made in person or by mail NOT LATER 
  THAN 30 DAYS from the mail date on this notice" 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Therefore, for claimants and employers who have relied on those 
  instructions, and mailed hearing requests within 30 days of the date of the 
  determination, the Appeal Board has held that it would be unfair, and a denial 
  of due process, to find such hearing requests untimely.

<h2><center>SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING</center></h2>
<P>The U.S. Department of Labor has reported the results of studies conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse which conclude that seventy percent of all illegal drug users are employed.  In addition, it has been estimated that one in ten people in the U.s. has an alcohol problem.  It is not surprising therefore, that in the course of the last twenty years, substance abuse testing has become a routinely used tool for many employers.  In addition to its federally mandated use by employers in public and private transportation, it has also been utilized by employers to enforce policies calling for drug and alcohol free workplaces.  It has proven particularly useful though, in the areas of accident investigation and pre-employment screening.</P>
<P>This Review Letter discusses and summarizes those aspects of drug and alcohol testing procedures which have been shown to be relevant to the adjudication of unemployment insurance claims.  It contains a description of the various testing methods currently used, and the capabilities of each.  Special attention is paid to evidentiary problems associated with testing procedures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT TESTS vs. THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>An employer's right to conduct drug and alcohol testing in the workplace and to insist that an employee submit to a test, is generally established either by the requirements of applicable federal regulations, or by the terms of an employer's drug and alcohol policy, to which employees agree at the time of hire.</P>
<P>A demand by an employer that an employee produce a urine sample for drug testing has always been considered an infringement of an employee's right to privacy.  For this reason, public employers in the 1980s found it necessary to defend their drug and alcohol policies from challenges claiming that such policies violated the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, in that they required an employee to submit to an unreasonable search and seizure (<U>Patchogue-Medford Teachers Congress v. Board of Education</U>, 70 NY 2d 57 (1987); also <U>Caruso v. Ward</U>, 72 NY 2d 432 {1988}). The courts held that the taking of a urine sample is a search and seizure, and the public employers involved in these and other cases were required to demonstrate that their policies met the federal and state constitutional thresholds.  Many employers consequently had to modify their policies to conform to the courts' decisions.</P>
<P>Many of the precedents and principles established as a result of the numerous court decisions dealing with drug testing ultimately were incorporated in the regulations which were enacted due to the Omnibus Transportation Employees Testing Act of 1991.  These regulations, issued by the Federal Transit Administration on February 15, 1994, (49 CFR Part 653 &amp; 49 CFR Part 654), established drug and alcohol testing policies for employees of mass transit systems.  (See Review Letter 2-99).  Similar regulations were adopted to establish testing policies applicable to employees holding commercial driving licenses, to certain public utilities workers such as those employed in nuclear power facilities, and to workers in other occupations with respect to which there are grave public safety concerns.  Thus, by federal law, a broad category of workers in safety sensitive occupations, in both public and private employment, are now required to submit to drug and alcohol testing procedures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">EMPLOYER POLICIES</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>The constitutional issue mentioned above, is only relevant with respect to a public employer.  "A search by a private person or nongovernmental entity does not violate constitutional rights" (<U>Matter of Atkinson</U>, 185 AD 2d 415,416 {3<SUP>rd</SUP> Dept.}).  Therefore a private employer's drug and alcohol testing policy need not meet any constitutional standards.  However, despite the court's ruling in the <U>Matter of</U> <U>Atkinson</U>, the Appeal Board has held that when an employee in private employment refuses to submit to drug testing where there is no reasonable suspicion of drug use or specific advance notice that such testing would be a condition of employment, claimant's refusal to submit is not an act of misconduct (AB 383,643).  Therefore, in resolving unemployment insurance claims with respect to drug testing, essentially the same standards may be applied to public and private employees. </P>
<P>This is not to say though that all employer policies are alike.  Some employer policies prohibit being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or possessing alcohol or drugs, only while on duty, a limited restriction.  If a worker subject to this policy were to submit a urine sample which tested positive for marijuana, the test result alone would not establish that the claimant had violated the employer's policy.  It would not prove that claimant had used marijuana or had been under the influence of it while on duty; it would only show that he had used it recently.</P>
<P>On the other hand, some employer policies require "testing clean", with respect to drugs.  Such a policy prohibits any illicit drug use, on or off the job.  Therefore, any positive test result for a worker subject to such policy would constitute a violation of the policy.  And a worker terminated in such situation would be subject to a misconduct disqualification.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">TESTING METHODS</P>
</U><P>Alcohol Breath Test</P></p>
<P>The breathalyzer, as it is commonly known, is an economical and simple device for measuring blood alcohol levels.  It is used by law enforcement agencies throughout the country and its reliability is widely accepted.  It is important to understand that this test does not rely on alcohol present in the mouth or throat for its results.  Instead, it measures blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) by detecting the presence of alcohol in the gas excreted by the lungs as a product of respiration.  It measures alcohol, in other words, that has been consumed and metabolized by the body.  Therefore, repeated rinsing of the mouth after consuming alcohol will not "fool" the test.</P>
<P>The test is conducted as follows: the person is asked to take a deep breath and blow hard into the testing device.  The alcohol level is read as a percentage by weight of alcohol in the blood.  What constitutes an acceptable level depends entirely on the applicable law, regulation or rule.  Under the Federal Mass Transit Regulations, a reading of .04 is too high.  Many employers now have zero tolerance policies.  Zero tolerance (.02 or greater) is also the standard pursuant to New York State's Motor Vehicle Law for drivers under 21 years of age.  For drivers over 21 in New York, a reading of between .06 and .09 will result in a charge of Driving While Ability Impaired (DWAI).  If the reading is .10 or greater the charge would be Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  A first time DWI offense is a misdemeanor, but a second offense is a felony.</P>
<P>Urine Tests</P>
<P>The procedures for taking and testing urine samples for drug screening purposes have been subject over the past twenty years to numerous refining influences.  There have been countless grievances, arbitration proceedings, and lawsuits questioning the accuracy of the test methods and the reliability of the procedures used to take and transport the samples.  The entire process has also been subject to legislative and regulatory review.  Laboratories which conduct urine tests for purposes of drug screening in New York State must obtain a Forensic Toxicology permit form the New York State department of Health. The department's Proficiency Testing Program Guide states that to qualify for this permit, a laboratory ". . . must support protocols for specimen chain-of-custody, laboratory security, and result confidentiality.  The laboratory must also maintain acceptable methods for the confirmation analysis of presumptive positive drug screens."</P>
<P>Blood Tests</P>
<P>Blood specimens are sometimes taken to confirm (or rebut) the results of an alcohol breath test, or urine test for drugs.  Such tests are reliable and accepted, but are not routinely used, as the tests are more expensive than other test methods.  Furthermore, the compulsory taking of a blood sample is considered to be an even greater invasion of privacy than the taking of a urine sample.</P>
<P>Hair Testing</P>
<P>The newest test for the detection of drug use is hair testing.  The NYC Police Department began using hair testing to screen probationary employees a few years ago, and now uses it also in its random testing program or regular officers.  The many advantages of hair testing are likely to result in an increasing use of this method of screening. Taking a small hair sample from a person does not require privacy, and is not as intrusive as the taking of a urine or blood sample.  In addition, hair testing is better at detecting long-term drug use than any other test.  While a urine sample can reveal cocaine use in the prior three days or marijuana use in the prior thirty days, hair testing will detect the use of those drugs in the prior six months.  The Appeal Board has recently ruled that hair tests can provide reliable evidence of drug use (A-750-2109; AB 479,408).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">REFUSAL TO TAKE A TEST</P>
</U><P>After an Accident</P>
<P>Drug testing typically comes to our attention in unemployment insurance cases when an employee fails a test, or refuses to take a test, and is discharged as a result. Refusing a take a drug or alcohol test required by employer's policy, or by federal regulations to which the employer is subject, has been repeatedly held to be misconduct.  In AB 416,974 the employer, a manufacturer of large industrial batteries, had instituted a policy requiring employees involved in industrial accidents to submit to drug and alcohol testing, and provided further that refusal to comply with the policy could result in discharge.  The claimant, operating a vehicle similar to a forklift, struck a co-worker, and refused thereafter to submit to a drug test.  The Board concluded his refusal was misconduct.</P>
<P>Drug Paraphernalia &amp; Under the Influence</P>
<P>In similar cases involving the refusal to take a drug or alcohol test, misconduct was found when employer's policy was found to be reasonable and when there was specific justification for attempting to test the employee.  For example, the claimant in AB 431,862 was discharged for refusal to take a drug test when circumstances arose which created a strong suspicion that claimant was under the influence of drugs.  The circumstances included claimant's blood-shot eyes and disorientation and a hypodermic needle found in a bathroom stall the claimant had just left.  In this case also the Appeal Board held that claimant's refusal to take a drug test was misconduct.</P>
<P>An essentially similar pattern of facts produced a similar decision in AB 410,267.  It was concluded by the Board that claimant's presence in the employer's parking lot when he should have been at this work station, on two occasions, coupled with his mumbled and confused response to security's questions, gave the employer a reasonable basis for demanding that claimant take a drug test.  The Board also found that at the time of hire, claimant had signed a document giving his consent to ". . . intermittent and unscheduled blood and urine, drugs and alcohol screening, as determined appropriate by the employer."  Thus, the conditions described by the Board in AB 383,643 were met: there was a reasonable suspicion of drug use, <U>and</U> advance notice that testing was to be a condition of employment.  Claimant's refusal to be tested was consequently misconduct.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">CHAIN OF CUSTODY</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>The phrase, "chain of custody", refers to the procedures that are designed to preserve evidence until it is introduced at a trial or hearing.  In unemployment insurance drug cases, evidence of the chain of custody includes documents and testimony which establish who possessed the blood, urine or hair sample beginning with the time it was first obtained, and ending when the sample is tested at the laboratory and the results are reported.  Local office fact finding need only establish that the employer has a procedure to ensure the validity of the test, and that the procedure was followed.  The substantial burden of proof though, must be borne by the employer.</P>
<P>Specifically, when a person who tests positive for drugs asserts that the test results are wrong, the employer must prove that the laboratory properly tested claimant's urine and accurately reported the results.  Evidence must therefore be produced regarding: 1) the chain of custody of the sample, and 2) the accuracy and reliability of the test methods.  At a hearing an employer would need to produce an expert witness, usually a chemist, as well as documents and testimony about the taking, packaging and labeling of the sample; employer would have to establish where the sample was placed after it left claimant's possession, how and by whom it was transported to the laboratory, as well as the further chain of custody once it arrived at the lab (AB 412,469).  If such evidence is inadequate, claimant's challenge of the test results would very likely prevail (AB 422,868).</P>
<P>The Appeal Board has held however, that when the person who failed the drug test has admitted to having used the substance in question, evidence regarding the chain of custody and the expertise of the persons conducting the tests is not necessary.  Such an admission against interest is sufficient to establish misconduct (AB 425,094).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>There are legitimate reasons why an employer might wish new employees to have a physical examination: for example, to reduce the cost of group health and life insurance, to reduce potential liability in the event of an on the job accident, and others.  However, in order to protect persons with disabilities from discriminatory hiring practices, the provisions of the New York Sate Human rights Law (Executive Law, Art. 15), prohibit an employer's requiring a job applicant to submit to a medical examination as a condition of hire, unless the requirement is based on a specific occupational qualification.  Therefore to avoid any possible violations of the law, many employers delay scheduling medical examinations until a few days after the employee starts working.</P>
<P>If medical examination under these circumstances were to include a drug screening test, and a worker were to fail the test, revolving a subsequent unemployment claim for such a person would be very straightforward.  Since this would not be a "pre-employment" test, but a test in the course of employment, a worker who failed, in violation of an employer rule, would be subject to a misconduct disqualification just as any other worker would be.</P>
<P>In a recently decided case, it was found that the employer failed to conduct a pre-employment drug test required by Federal Regulations in effect with respect to commercial drivers.  Instead, the employer conducted the test a few days after claimant's employment had commenced.  The claimant tested positive for marijuana and was discharged.  The Appeal Board did not consider it significant that the test was not administered until after the claimant began working.  Nor was found controlling that the claimant may not have used the drug on or after the date when he began his employment.  The Board sustained the misconduct disqualification due to the potential dire consequences of a driver's marijuana use (AB 493,577). </P>
<P>The pre-employment testing of job applicants to determine whether they are engaging in the illegal use of drugs does not in fact violate the provisions of the Human Rights Law.  With respect to the use of controlled substances, the statute protects only those individuals who are either rehabilitated substance abusers, or are in the process of being rehabilitated.  In addition, the Federal Regulations mentioned above require pre-employment drug screening for some occupations.  Therefore, it is necessary now and then to resolve the claims of persons whose unemployment is attributable to their failing a pre-employment test.  Pre-employment drug testing is not uncommon, and a worker's failing such a test can result in a disqualification from benefits.</P>
<P>For example, a person who quits a job to accept another position which is offered on the condition that the applicant pass a drug test, should be disqualified for voluntary leaving without good cause if he or she fails the test.  The employment offer could not be considered a definite offer, since it was conditioned on the test results.  In addition, the applicant should certainly have known that he or she would not pass the test.</P>
<P>A recent claim for benefits provides another example.  The case involved a worker whose last assignment with an employment agency prior to the filing of an unemployment claim, ended due to a lack of work.  Thereafter, the claimant was offered another assignment through this agency while the claimant was still in benefits.  The client, at whose place of business claimant would be working required, for legitimate reasons, that the claimant submit to a urine test for drug screening purposes before employment could begin.  Claimant's refusal to submit to such a test was deemed a disqualifying refusal of employment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">CREDIBILITY &amp; EXPERT EVIDENCE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>In general, if a person fails an alcohol breath test pursuant to an employer's policy or to Federal Regulations, and attributes such failure to something other than a prohibited consumption of alcohol, his statements should be scrutinized and closely questioned.  For instance, a claimant might contend that he consumed a prescription or over the counter cough medicine containing alcohol.  Such a claimant must be asked to identify the precise medicine, to state its alcohol content (indicated on the bottle), and to specify how much of it was consumed in the six to eight hour period prior to the breath test.  Although it is tempting to dismiss such a claimant statement as incredible, strictly speaking its rebuttal requires expertise.  The employer would ultimately need to provide expert evidence that the test result would not have been caused by the amount of cough medicine consumed.</P>
<P>Although the expert opinion of a qualified chemist is often necessary to rebut the specific denials heard from those accused of inappropriate alcohol or drug use, some general knowledge about the rate at which alcohol is metabolized may make it easier to distinguish credible explanations from unlikely and preposterous ones.  According to the American Medical Association, an average sized person who consumes three or four units of alcohol within an hour or two, and then stops, will have a blood alcohol level which peaks three to four hours after he or she began drinking, at a level at or above the legal limit for driving in most states.  The alcohol would not be completely eliminated from the body until six to eight hours after the drinking began.  One "unit" of alcohol is defined as a small glass of wine, a glass of beer, or a shot of hard liquor.</P>
<P>In a recently argued case currently pending before the Appeal Board, the claimant, a commercial driver, failed a breathalyzer test administered at the end of his eight hour shift.  Although the test indicated a low amount of blood alcohol, employer had a zero tolerance policy.  Furthermore, the employer believed that any alcohol reading signified that the claimant had been drinking during his shift.  Claimant was discharged.  The claimant argued that he did not drink during his shift and that the test result could only have been caused by the drinking he did the night before.  He stated he stopped drinking at 11:00 p.m.  The employer produced an expert witness who testified that claimant's story was not possible.  A positive reading at the end of his shift had to have come from alcohol he consumed during the previous six to eight hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2><center> ALCOHOLISM</center> </h2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It has been seventeen years since the writing of the division's last overview publication on the complex and difficult subject of alcoholism, Field Memo 6-82. Although the principles described therein remain valid, the unemployment insurance case law pertaining to alcoholism has expanded considerably in the intervening period.                  </P>
<P>This Review Letter surveys the current state of the case law with respect to alcoholism. The principles described in Field Memo 6-82 are reviewed, and new rules and concepts, established by Appeal Board and Court decisions, are discussed. Particular attention is paid to cases in which the Board or the Court decided that a claimant's actions leading to his loss of employment were disqualifying, notwithstanding the fact that claimant was an alcoholic. </P>
<P>You will also notice that within the text specific Appeal Board and Court cases are identified. Although this is not a common feature in the composition of Review Letters, it is felt that due to the encompassing scope of this overview, such specific references would aid readers in their own further research on this topic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>INTRODUCTION</P>
</U>
<P>The prior analysis of cases dealing with alcoholism, and actions by an alcoholic, established some broad principles, that while still valid principles, need closer examination in their application. Further rulings by the Appeal Board and the Courts have examined the extent to which claimant's actions can be, or should not be, excused because the claimant is identified as an alcoholic.  </P>
<P>In addition, in the passage of seventeen years since that memorandum, a vast evolution in the recognition of alcoholism as a work-related problem has given a strong impetus to the creation and use of Employee Assistance Programs. As employers have become more compassionate in their policies toward the alcoholic employee, and provided additional resources for the protection of employment in the face of this illness, an increased responsibility also arises on the part of the worker to avail himself of such assistance to safeguard employment, while addressing the effects of his illness on his employment. </P>
<P>There are many specific instances of behaviors by an alcoholic that have been ruled on by the Appeal Board to clearly constitute misconduct. The purpose of this review is to distinguish the actions that were beyond the claimant's control, because of his addiction to alcohol, and the actions that do pass the threshold test of "volition", and therefore are disqualifying misconduct. </P>
<P>An action in transgression of an employer's rule does not constitute misconduct simply because it is a violation of a rule, or because it is offensive to our commonly held values, but because it is deliberate. An act, or a careless omission, is misconduct if it was within the control of the person who committed that act. Conversely, an act is not misconduct if it was entirely beyond the control of the person who committed it. </P>
<P>Drinking alcohol to excess is the act that is beyond an alcoholic's control. Inebriation is a passive effect, resulting directly from the consumption of alcohol. A characteristic of alcoholism is the inability to judge one's own inebriation. </P>
<P>For the purposes of determining and distinguishing what actions are <B>entirely attributable</B> to the disease of alcoholism, and those actions which do constitute misconduct, whether or not the person who committed them is an alcoholic, we must consider the factors of control and deliberateness, as demonstrated in claimant's actions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>ALCOHOLISM IS AN ILLNESS</P></U> 
<P>The illness of alcoholism is characterized by a lack of control over drinking alcohol, and inebriation.  When the evidence of claimant's alcoholism has been established by appropriate proof, it is a defense for drinking alcohol; and the lack of control takes the drinking out of the realm of misconduct. It does <b>not</b> take all the other actions by an alcoholic out of the realm of misconduct, as alcoholism does not render all other actions involuntary, or beyond the control of the alcoholic. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>ALCOHOL PLUS DRUGS</P>
</U>
<P>However, when the evidence establishes that the claimant had a drug problem as well as an alcohol problem and the discharge was caused by repeated absences from work resulting from dependency upon both alcohol and drugs, a disqualification for misconduct is appropriate. The Appeal Board held that alcohol abuse does not excuse the use of drugs. A claimant who is an alcoholic, fired from her job for testing positive for cocaine, was held disqualified for misconduct notwithstanding her claim that she only used cocaine when she was under the influence of alcohol (AB 426599). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> <U>PROOF OF ALCOHOLISM</P>
</U>
<P>In order to excuse an act that might otherwise constitute misconduct, due to the illness of alcoholism, the claimant must produce competent evidence of this condition (AB 470901). A claimant's self-serving and unsubstantiated lay opinion is not adequate proof (AB 435359).</P>
<P>The clearest proof of alcoholism is medical evidence of treatment for the disease during the course of employment. Evidence of participation in Alcoholics Anonymous or similar programs while employed, evidence of recent attempts to enter an alcohol rehabilitation program, and evidence of a history of drinking problems on the job can serve to establish that an individual is an alcoholic (AB 477473). However, it is now widely understood that alcoholism is considered an illness. Care must therefore be taken to distinguish true alcoholics from those seeking to create an excuse for their improper behavior (AB 445561). </P>
<P>A recent claim for benefits involved a former NYC Police Officer, fired for stealing hubcaps while off-duty. He and his partner were caught red-handed, but argued at their disciplinary hearing that they were alcoholics, and were drunk at the time of the theft. The trial commissioner who presided found this explanation to be "...self-serving and tailored to diminish (their) liability for (their) misconduct". Neither officer had ever claimed to be an alcoholic, nor received treatment for alcoholism, prior to the theft. </P>
<P>Although these officers would have been disqualified from benefits due to misconduct whether alcoholics or not, a finding of alcoholism by the hearing officer might have saved their jobs. This case illustrates the reason why after-the-fact claims of alcoholism should be viewed with suspicion, particularly when an employee repeatedly denied being an alcoholic, or refused assistance while employed. </P>
<p><B><P>Evidence of the existence of alcoholism at the time of the commission of an act that causes claimant's discharge needs to be carefully evaluated.</B> Where an employer has confronted an employee with a question about suspected alcohol abuse, and provided the employee the opportunity to address his illness, a denial by the employee that he is an alcoholic should not be disregarded. Nor should such a denial be viewed as a symptom of alcoholism, in the absence of other evidence of the disease. When the claimant had denied that he is an alcoholic, and failed to remedy the work-related problems identified by the employer, neither his later statement that he is an alcoholic, nor his post-employment treatment for alcoholism, can serve to excuse the earlier actions that caused his discharge (AB 454380).                         </P></p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>A "SLIP"</P>
</U>
<P>A claimant is not disqualified for actions that are beyond his control: when a claimant has lost employment due to an act that is entirely attributable to his alcoholism, he is not held to have committed misconduct. Following prior disciplinary dismissal, a claimant had been rehired under the conditions of a "last chance" agreement, to remain alcohol free, and to submit to random testing. A positive test result would result in his immediate discharge from employment. Three months later, he reported to work smelling of alcohol, and a blood test confirmed the presence of alcohol in his system. Claimant admitted that he had been drinking the night before. The Appeal Board held that his failure to remain alcohol free was a "slip", and could not be characterized as misconduct. The Appellate Division affirmed, finding that the claimant's alcoholism caused the behavior that lead to the discharge (<U>Matter of Snell</U>, 195 AD 2d 746). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>FAILURE TO REMAIN ALCOHOL FREE/ FAILURE TO ATTEND REHAB</P>
</U>
<P>A discharge for <B>failure to</B> <B>remain alcohol free</B>, as agreed to by a stipulation to an arbitration award, is not misconduct if claimant's failure to do so is the direct result of claimant's alcoholism. However, <B>failure to comply with the attendance requirements of a rehabilitation program</B>, that is, to attend scheduled counselling sessions or AA meetings pursuant to an arbitration stipulation, is misconduct, as this behavior is well within the claimant's control. (<U>Matter of Restifo</U>, 88 AD 2d 1045; AB 407,090).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>ABSENCE DUE TO ILLNESS</P>
</U>
<P>It remains true that while a disqualification from benefits would ordinarily arise in a case of excessive absenteeism for personal reasons, such disqualification should not be imposed when the absences are due to alcoholism. This is because alcoholism is an illness, and absence due to illness is not misconduct. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>FAILURE TO CALL IN WHEN ABSENT</P></U> 
<P>However, it is not true that any action related to the illness of alcoholism would fail to constitute misconduct. It is clearly justified to hold that a worker who was ill, and absent from work, but failed to call for non-compelling reasons, has committed misconduct. Notwithstanding the compelling reason for the absence, failure to call can constitute misconduct, when this failure was due to circumstances within the worker's control (AB 454149). The responsibility to call in when absent exists for a claimant who is ill due to the flu; it exists also for the claimant who is ill due to alcoholism. An employee who is an alcoholic, and who cannot report to work, is still expected to call in as required, unless he is physically incapable of doing so. The fact that he does not wish to reveal his illness to the employer is not a compelling reason for failing to call in. His responsibility to contact his employer to notify him of the absence is not removed; his failure to properly notify the employer as required is misconduct regardless of his alcoholism (AB 402,246; <U>Matter of Morse</U>, Appellate Division decision dated Sept.17, 1998). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>FALSE REASON FOR ABSENCE</P>
</U><P>   </P>
<P>A claimant, who was employed as a helper to a printing press operator, had received repeated warnings about his attendance. He was absent, and called in to tell his employer that he was ill. The next workday, he called in and advised the employer that his grandfather had died. He was granted three days leave of absence pursuant to the employer's bereavement policies for close relatives. In fact, the claimant's grandfather had not died. When the employer learned that the reason claimant had given for the absence was false, the claimant was fired. Even while claimant's absenteeism problems stemmed largely from claimant's alcoholism, the Appeal Board held that lying to one's employer is misconduct, and the fact that claimant is an alcoholic did not excuse this action (AB 446,322). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>THEFT / THEFT OF ALCOHOL</P></U> 
<P>A worker who takes alcoholic beverages belonging to his employer without authorization, has committed theft. Such theft is not excused by the assertion that claimant stole the alcohol for his own consumption, and that he is an alcoholic. There is no proof that the disease of alcoholism causes one to steal. In two separate cases, the Appeal Board ruled that the claimants' acts of theft justified disqualification from benefits (AB 416,987; AB 465,642).                </P>
<P>Two other cases involved thefts committed by alcoholic employees while under the influence of intoxicants. One worker attempted to steal cooked shrimp from his employer, the other stole cash from a co-worker. The Appeal Board held that alcoholism does not mitigate theft or attempted theft, whether or not the individual was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the theft (AB 484,196; AB 415,934). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>LEAVING WORK EARLY</P></U> 
<P>A claimant who had previously received warnings for violations of the employer's rule against leaving work early without permission, was discharged after again violating this rule. The claimant stated that he left work early because he wanted to spend more time in the local bar, claiming that this was compelled by his alcoholism. The Appeal Board found that it was significant that claimant was sober at the time that he left work early, and rejected the contention that claimant had no control over his actions. His awareness that his job was in danger, and his admission that he could have stayed until the end of his shift, contradicted the allegation that claimant's acts were involuntary (AB 409,288). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>INEBRIATION</P>
</U>
<P>When a person has decided to consume alcoholic beverages, he is risking inebriation. When he further decides to report to work under the influence of alcohol, he is taking a risk that his work performance will be affected, sometimes with potentially disastrous consequences. If reporting to work under the influence of alcohol is a violation of safety regulations, it is misconduct. </P>
<P>A claimant who becomes inebriated during working hours, or who reports to work in an inebriated condition, in violation of an employer's policy of a drug/alcohol free workplace, is subject to a misconduct disqualification, even if an alcoholic.  The Appeal Board held that a claimant who drank at lunch and returned to work in an inebriated condition, despite prior warnings about drinking on the job, was guilty of misconduct. Although claimant was an alcoholic, he was aware his job was in jeopardy and chose not to take advantage of his employer's offer regarding a rehabilitation program (AB 442010). </P>
<P>The fact that claimant was inebriated at the time that he committed another action which caused his discharge from employment, does not categorically preclude a determination that his actions constituted misconduct. <B>Claimant's alcoholism does not excuse him from the consequences of actions he took while under the influence of alcohol, when those actions in themselves would constitute misconduct. </B>While an alcoholic may not be able to control his consumption of alcohol, and consequent inebriation, he is not excused from the consequences of acts committed while intoxicated. It is misconduct to engage in a fistfight at a company party when one is drunk, whether or not one is an alcoholic.            </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p><U><P>DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL</P></U></p>
<P>A multitude of decisions by the Appeal Board have long since established and reaffirmed the principle that a loss of employment that requires a valid driver's license, due to the loss of the license for Driving While Intoxicated, is disqualifying. Even when the claimant is an alcoholic, and his drinking may be beyond his control, his decision to get into his car and drive is not excused, despite the fact that that decision was made while under the influence of alcohol (AB 409160; AB 413874; AB 416606). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>ABSENCE DUE TO INCARCERATION FOR D.W.I.</P>
</U>
<P>A claimant was arrested and incarcerated for driving while intoxicated. He was absent from work for several days, and discharged as a result. The Appeal Board held that the claimant's alcoholism was not a defense to his driving while intoxicated, nor did it excuse the extended absence due to incarceration that ended claimant's employment (AB 384215A; AB 441529). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>ASSAULT</P></U> 
<P>A claimant, who was an alcoholic, was observed by his supervisor not performing his assigned task. At that time, the supervisor complained about the claimant, and the claimant approached the supervisor and struck him in the face. Claimant was discharged because of the assault upon the supervisor. The Appeal Board rejected the contention that because the claimant was under the influence of alcohol, his actions must be considered part of his illness for which he was not responsible. The assault was held to constitute misconduct (AB 361894).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</P></U>                                                      
<P>Another claimant, who was an alcoholic, was employed by a cleaning service contracted to clean a train station. He was found to be intoxicated at work, and was directed to go home. He did not leave, but rather went into the office of a female railroad announcer, and made unsolicited sexual advances toward her. The Appeal Board held that the claimant's alcoholism and inebriation do not excuse his actions (AB 441399). The Appellate Division affirmed the decision of the Appeal Board. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>FALSIFICATION OF TIME RECORDS</P>
</U>
<P>A claimant who worked on the night shift for a baking company had previously been through an alcoholic inpatient program. Subsequently, he had received a disciplinary suspension for falsification of time records. Seven months later, claimant again falsified his time records for two successive dates, by leaving early from work and writing in a later time. Claimant was under the influence of alcohol on these dates. The Appeal Board held that such falsification of time records were acts of dishonesty that amounted to theft of wages. This was not excused due to alcoholism, and did constitute misconduct (AB 447,998).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>A QUESTION OF CONTROL</P></U>                                      
<P>The next case involves a complex set of facts. A claimant had previously received inpatient treatment for alcoholism, and had regularly attended aftercare therapy and AA. Claimant was working as a driver for a food service company. Prior to the start of his workday, claimant had some alcohol. He realized he would be late for work, and called his employer to advise that he would be late.  He intended to go home to shower, sober up and report to work. He planned to work as a helper and have his partner do the driving. When he got home, he got into an argument with his wife, and continued his drinking, rather than go to work. He did not report for work or contact his employer to revise the message that he had previously left. He was consequently discharged from his job.                                              </P>
<P>   </P>
<P>The Appeal Board held that the claimant demonstrated sufficient control over his actions to be held to have committed misconduct in connection with his employment. He had realized that he needed to sober up before coming to work, and had called the employer to advise of his anticipated lateness. He had stopped his drinking, he had even planned to refrain from driving; he was taking responsible steps, before he made the choice to resume his drinking. Based on all these facts, the Board concluded, the claimant's medical condition of alcoholism did not cause his absence from work, and his acts constitute misconduct (AB 410655). </P>
<P>Whenever a claimant exercises awareness and self-control in connection with acts that caused the discharge, it may be possible to conclude that such acts are not attributable to his disease. The more control demonstrated, the more claimant's contention that the acts are involuntary is undermined and belied.                                   </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>EMPLOYEES IN PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS</P></U>                  
<P>The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires alcohol and drug testing of safety sensitive employees in mass transit systems. Pursuant to this Congressional mandate, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has issued regulations requiring alcohol misuse prevention programs and establishing clear procedures that must be followed by public transportation system employers to ensure public safety.                                                                </P>
<P>All employees who perform safety sensitive functions are subject to these regulations. A safety sensitive function is said to be one which is "... fraught with such risk of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention can have disastrous consequences." Such functions are performed by those who:                                </P>
<dir>
<P>             * operate transit vehicles                               </P>
<P>             * dispatch or control transit vehicles                   </P>
<P>             * maintain or repair transit vehicles or equipment          </P>
<P>             * provide security <U>and</U> carry a firearm. </P>
</dir>
<P>The significance of this designation is that workers who perform these functions are required to be subjected to random alcohol breathalyzer tests. Any such worker who refuses to submit to the test, or who has a test result of 0.04 or greater must be removed from safety sensitive duties, must be referred to an alcohol treatment program, and cannot be returned to work in such duties until cleared for return to work by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is defined as a physician, or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional with knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol related disorders; or an addiction counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission.                                                          </P>
<P>The regulations also specifically prohibit drinking any alcohol within four hours of the start of one's shift, and of course, drinking during one's shift. In separate decisions, the Appeal Board has sustained disqualifications arising from violations of these two regulations, despite the workers' alcoholism, because of the <b>potential for harm</b> to the claimant himself, to his coworkers, and to the customers of the transit system (AB 471,802, AB 479,891). In neither case did the Board find any excuse in the fact that the claimant did not actually perform any work on the day he reported in an impaired condition.</P>
<P>A safety sensitive employee who loses employment due to failing a breathalyzer test, or violating any of the alcohol regulations, has committed an act of misconduct even if he or she offers alcoholism as an excuse. Such a worker has violated the employer's rules and Federal Regulations and has endangered the safety of the public, his co-workers, or both. The situation is analogous to driving while intoxicated. But an important element of the FTA Regulations is that they make no distinction between vehicle operation and other safety sensitive functions. A track installer, conductor or mechanic is every bit as responsible for the public safety as a bus or train operator. Therefore any violation of the regulations by any safety sensitive worker is inexcusable. </P>
<P>Workers who lose employment in this circumstance must also be deemed ineligible for benefits on the grounds of incapability. The Regulations require that a worker who fails a breathalyzer test be referred to counseling, and further require that he or she cannot return to duty until cleared by an SAP. Such a worker is incapable due to the regulatory requirements, whether or not the worker is an alcoholic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>SEPARATION FROM WORK THAT AFFECTS RECOVERY</P>
</U>
<P>A claimant had been employed as a postal clerk, and she transferred from NYC to upstate. She accepted and worked a part-time flexible schedule, subjecting her to varying work hours and days. Claimant was a recovered alcoholic, and attended AA meetings five days a week, three hours a day. Her varying work schedule made it impossible for her to maintain her attendance at AA, and she sought assistance through the EAP program, which did not meet her need. Eventually she quit her job because her health was in jeopardy. The Appeal Board held this to be good cause (AB 381,830).</P>
<P>In another case, a claimant had worked as a banquet manager for a country club catering establishment for five years. During this time, she became an alcoholic. She was exposed to and tempted by alcohol which was available to her during working hours. She resigned and entered rehabilitation immediately. She was recommended to seek another occupation, away from circumstances in which she would be exposed to alcohol. The Appeal Board held this voluntary leaving to be with good cause (AB 392,237).</P>
<P>However, a claimant who left his job as a trucker after his release from drug rehabilitation did so without good cause. He had advised his drug counselor, but not his employer, that co-workers were using drugs. The employer had no opportunity to investigate and correct the problem. In addition, the Appeal Board ruled that because the use of illegal drugs is subject to strict legal prohibition against possession and sale, and the negative consequences of its use can or should be reasonably foreseen, this is not good cause to quit one's job (AB 458,060).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>CAPABILITY AND AVAILABILITY / PROOF OF RECOVERY</P>
</U>
<P>In all instances where a claimant's separation from employment was related to alcoholism, the courts have recognized the need to determine if the individual is capable of work (<U>Matter of Grajales</U>, 104 AD 2d 688). Therefore, this issue must be thoroughly explored. As in any other case where separation from employment was the result of illness, or illness related circumstances, there must be additional fact finding and a determination of the alcoholic claimant's <b>current ability to work</b> in a safe and sober manner.                            </P>
<P>Evidence of the successful <U>completion</U> of a formal alcohol treatment program at a medical facility, with or without a period of hospitalization, but with on-going counselling of some kind is sufficient to establish recovery from alcoholism, and current ability to work (AB 418,117; AB 480,461). Attendance at AA meetings however, is not reliable evidence of recovery (AB 480,461). Anyone can continue to drink while attending AA meetings, and many people do (AB 418,011). Furthermore, the second "A" in AA stands for anonymous. No attendance is taken at AA meetings, and consequently no claimant can provide corroborative evidence of regular attendance at such meetings.   </P>
<P>Failure to present competent medical evidence of treatment of the disease, from a substance abuse professional who is qualified to judge that claimant is now capable of working, should result in a determination that the claimant is not able to work. Such medical evidence would be considered competent if presented or written by a medical doctor (MD), psychologist (Ph.D.), certified social worker (CSW or ACSW), or certified alcoholism counselor (CAC). When such evidence is presented, the claimant's availability for employment demonstrating a genuine attachment to the labor market should also be explored.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">  JUNE, 1997</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<h2><center>MISCONDUCT OR "POOR JUDGMENT"?</center></h2>
<P>From time to time, it is necessary to revisit issues which are thought to be simple, in order to refamiliarize ourselves with the legal principles at work.  To often, individual case details tend to obscure the underlying framework, and the shorthand phrases we habitually use tend to confuse rather than clarify these issues.</P>
<P>This Review Letter discusses some of the ways by which misconduct can be distinguished from non-disqualifying acts and omissions.  It examines the implications of the phrases and concepts frequently used to describe circumstances which cause people to be terminated from employment.  The discussion is enhanced with numerous examples from the Interpretation Service Index and from case law.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INTRODUCTION</P>
<P>The word "misconduct" is not defined in the Unemployment Insurance Law.  Black's Law Dictionary however defines it as:</P>
<blockquote><P>"A transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful behavior, wilful in character, improper or wrong behavior; its synonyms are misdemeanor, misdeed, misbehavior, delinquency, impropriety, mismanagement, offense, but not negligence or carelessness."</P></blockquote>
<P>This is a general definition, and not one which is intended to specifically nor exclusively apply to Unemployment Insurance matters.  But by distinguishing misconduct from negligence and carelessness, it highlights one of the thornier problems that occurs in the adjudication of misconduct allegations.  The problem can be stated as follows: when is an act or omission, which adversely affects the employer, sufficiently excusable that the misconduct disqualification is inappropriately harsh?  The Appeal Board and the courts have found some acts of negligence and carelessness to constitute misconduct, and others to be excusable.  How does one distinguish between an incompetent employee and one who just won't do the job as he is told?  Where and how can these lines be drawn?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>POOR PERFORMANCE</P>
<P>In the introduction to the Misconduct section of the Interpretation Service Index it is stated that misconduct can be any volitional act or omission which is detrimental to an employer's interest, and can include acts or omissions off the job as well as on the job.  But, it is added, misconduct does not include:</P>
<blockquote><P>mere inefficiency,</P>
<P>inadequate performance as a result of inability or incapability,</P>
<P>inadvertent or ordinary negligence in isolated instances,</P>
<P>good faith errors in judgment or discretion.</P></blockquote>
<P>There is often no attempt to distinguish between the first three situations, and the phrase "poor performance" has been used to refer to any and all of them.  "Poor performance" is best illustrated in those situations in which an individual's best efforts were simply not good enough: the production worker who tries but can't quite work fast enough; the used car salesman whose "pitch" is insufficiently persuasive; the executive who can't pull his department out of the red.  Such persons are not disqualified from benefits. </P>
<P>This seems a clear enough idea, but it has nevertheless been misapplied.  An ALJ once found that an employer had failed to demonstrate at the hearing that claimant's sleeping on the job adversely affected his performance.  Even had the employer done so, the ALJ continued, poor performance is not misconduct.  The ALJ erred in substituting in his mind the phrase "poor performance" for "inadequate performance as a result of inability or incapability."  Had he applied the latter idea to his fact, none of which suggested inability or incapability, he would have reached a different conclusion, resulting in the denial of benefits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"POOR JUDGMENT"</P>
<P>More troublesome is the phrase "poor judgment", an abbreviated version of the fourth exception to misconduct, "good faith errors in judgment or discretion".  This phrase has proven to be much more mischievous than "poor performance" ever was.  To begin with, it is not immediately apparent why "poor judgment" would constitute an exception to misconduct.  <B>Doesn't every act of misconduct involve some poor judgment?</P>
<p></B><P>Hasn't the person who lost employment as a result of excessive lateness with no justification exercised poor judgment?  When a grocery clerk steals a candy bar from his employer and gets caught, hasn't he exercised poor judgment, (both in the taking and the getting caught)?  Indeed, the &quot;poorness&quot; of judgment has often been the standard by which misconduct has been measured.</P></p>
<P>In cases involving an allegation of insubordination, for instance, the reasonableness of the employer's rule or directive is weighed against claimant's "judgment" in disregarding it.  A machinist's refusal to wear safety goggles, despite the employer's rule, implemented with his union's approval to reduce eye injuries, is clearly poor judgment, and also misconduct.  Conversely, the Appeal Board ruled that a claimant's refusal to shave his facial hair, in violation of his employer's policy, did not constitute misconduct.  The Appeal Board resolved the issue based on the intrusiveness of the policy, which it found to be unreasonable.  The Appeal Board chose not to comment on the judgment of a worker who would forfeit his employment for his beard; and while it would be easy to call the claimant's judgment poor, one would still agree with the Board's resolution of the misconduct issue in the claimant's favor.  (However, where the employer has articulated a reason for having such a policy, for example, to insure the proper fit of personal protective equipment such as a dust mask, claimant's failure or refusal to adhere to the policy is misconduct.)</P>
<P>Deciding that a claimant's judgment was poor is quite simply not a reliable way to resolve misconduct issues. <B>In general, it would be easier to argue that misconduct is a type of "poor judgment", than to assert that "poor judgment" is an exception to misconduct.</P>
</B><P>EMPLOYER'S RULES &amp; INSTRUCTIONS</P>
<P>Despite its potential logical difficulties, the phrase "poor judgment" has been used in a great variety of situations, and with increasing frequency.  It has been misused to excuse: sleeping on the job by a security guard; a youth counselor's fraternizing with a resident after hours in clear violation of employer's rules; a home attendant's leaving a two year old child alone twice in one day, and many other acts and omissions.</P>
<P>However, when facts establish a final precipitating incident in which a worker decided to ignore a reasonable rule, law, regulation, established procedure, or frequently repeated instruction, neither the poor judgment exercised, nor the poor performance that resulted can serve to later the conclusion that such a person, when fired for this act, is unemployed due to misconduct.</P>
<P>The Appeal Board once considered the case of a pharmacist who improperly filled a faulty prescription for a narcotic.  The pharmacist had ignored the fact that the customer had himself entered the quantity of tablets on the prescription form in the pharmacist's presence.  This, the Board noted, violated Department of Health Regulations and was "more than mere poor judgment."  Similarly, a cashier's leaving the register open and unattended, resulting in theft by a customer, was found by the Appeal Board to be misconduct, since the employee had been recently warned about such behavior.</P>
<P>The Appeal Board has also found misconduct in a multitude of cases involving bank tellers whose failure to follow the bank's procedures enabled someone to cash a fraudulent check.  The same conclusion could be reached with respect to a grocery clerk who failed to follow the store policy regarding sale of tobacco or alcohol. therefore, a failure to follow policy in this regard transcends mere poor judgment, since it could foreseeably result in a violation of law.</P>
<p><B><P>An important element on these cases is that the claimants had an opportunity to consider the proper course to follow, and to foresee the consequences of their acts.</P>
</B><P>This is one reason why these cases are distinguishable from a waiter who trips and breaks some dishes, and a typist with a high error rate.</P></p>
<P>Poor judgment really implies an inappropriate decision or action in a discretionary situation within the bounds of an individual's authority, where differences of opinion are the norm.  However, a violation of a rule or a repeated refusal to follow instructions, is knowingly acting contrary to an obligation about which individual judgment as to whether or not to comply is not permissible.  If an employee knows a reasonable rule, he is expected to follow it; when circumstances arise which call for its application, substituting one's contrary judgment for the rule is insubordination.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INTENT</P>
<P>Some confusion arises when an action which was in violation of an employer rule, has not resulted in actual harm to the employer.  Any intentional, or knowing act in violation of an employer rule is misconduct, whether the employee intended harm as a result to the employer, or genuinely did not intend or foresee harm.  The Court of Appeals considered the case of a claimant who forged her supervisor's name to a request for information from an insurance company.  The Court concluded that her act ".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even though accomplished without intent to harm and not resulting in actual harm, constitutes misconduct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.".</P>
<P>A recent case involved a bank teller who did not require a depositor, whom she knew, to sign a receipt indicating he had received the funds she gave him.  This came to light when the depositor later claimed he hadn't received the money.  As a result claimant was fired.  When characterizing this act as a "honest mistake", the ALJ missed the point.  The claimant knowingly violated a reasonable rule.  The fact that claimant may not have intended to harm the bank is irrelevant.  What matters is that she intended to ignore the rule requiring her to obtain the customer's signature.  She did so deliberately, and without a compelling reason.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>GROSS NEGLIGENCE</P>
<P>Many cases of misconduct have been heard by the Appeal Board which involve workers who, because of the nature of their work, are held to a particularly high standard of diligence in the performance of their duties.  Workers who handle cash or are responsible for other's property, or who work in the health care field where inattentiveness can adversely affect a patient's health or even cause a loss of life, are examples of such employment.</P>
<P>"Gross negligence" is the intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another.  (Black's Law Dictionary).</P>
<P>A bus cleaner who simply fails to sweep under the farthest rear seat may not have committed misconduct; a bus matron who fails to search for the missing child by looking on the farthest rear seat has committed misconduct.  The obviously more catastrophic and foreseeable result from a careless performance of particular tasks is the compelling criterion.</P>
<P>It is tempting to excuse the decision of a claimant to remain silent when he witnesses wrongdoings on the job, when he has properly chosen not to participate in such deeds. However, the Appellate Division and the Appeal Board have repeatedly held that when an employee becomes aware of a theft by a co-worker, he has an obligation to speak; his mere non-participation in the theft does not excuse his deliberate disregard of the employer's interest.  Similarly, when an employee has been told of his duty to report any accident or damage, and he ignores this obligation, he has committed misconduct.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>FIRST OFFENSE, OR NO WARNING NEEDED</P>
<P>Violation of an established rule or of a standard of behavior may constitute an act of misconduct even when it is a first offense.  For example, theft, falsification of records including time cards, or drinking on the job may be sufficiently serious and require no prior warning.  Certain behaviors, when deliberately engaged in, which are obviously detrimental to an employer's interest, are misconduct needing no warning.  A bus driver who operates the employer's vehicle at a rate of speed exceeding legal limits is committing misconduct.  A superintendent who stores an unlicensed shotgun on the employer's premises has committed an act in violation of law and in obvious transgression of his employer's best interest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>SUMMARY</P>
<P>The preceding discussion was not intended as a thorough analysis of all aspects of misconduct.  It does however examine the usefulness of some of the more commonly used expressions, as well as some of the mistakes that arise when shorthand phrases substitute for more carefully thought our concepts.</P>
<P>Determinations issued that address misconduct, whether they are disqualifications or eligibilities, must clearly explain the determining factors that lead to the conclusion that an act was or was not misconduct.  It is clearly not sufficient to characterize a claimant's judgment or performance as "poor", since this fails to distinguish it from misconduct.</P>
<P>An employer is always entitled to expect its employees to deal honestly, to exercise reasonable care and diligence, and to adhere at all times to its reasonable rules.  when a claimant has been discharged for failing to do so, the determination must clearly address the characteristics of misconduct, and whether they are evident in this instance.</P>
<P>Good fact finding will distinguish a truly isolated instance of inadvertence from a repeated act of carelessness or wilful disregard of an employer's instructions.  Proper questioning of the employer is used to uncover the evidence of prior training in procedures, or warnings following prior errors.</P>
<P>Good fact finding should show the difference between situations where a worker has been called upon to make his own judgment about how to perform a given task, and a situation where a worker has knowingly failed to follow the steps his employer was entitled to require of him.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">REVIEW LETTER 2-96</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">  MARCH, 1996</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<h3><u><center>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</center></u></h3>
<P>A topic of recent concern is the eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits of workers separated form employment due to acts of domestic violence.  This Review Letter is a discussion of how case precedents are applied in resolving the eligibility issues of a claimant whose separation from employment resulted from circumstances involving domestic violence.  It is the Department policy to ensure consistent and appropriate determinations and to provide continued sensitivity to domestic violence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">VOLUNTARY LEAVING OF EMPLOYMENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>The most common issue raised for unemployment benefit purposes involving domestic violence is voluntary leaving of employment, often resulting from relocation of claimant's residence.  Other issues arising in circumstances resulting from domestic violence include loss of employment due to chronic absences or prolonged absence.</P>
<P>While the leaving of employment due to compelling personal circumstances can be held to be with good cause, several factors must be examined to evaluate whether good cause exists.  Prior cases decided by the appeal Board involving domestic violence, or circumstances with similar considerations are discussed below.  These cases demonstrate the nature of evidence required to show that voluntary leaving of employment was reasonable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR FOR PERSONAL SAFETY</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>Claimant may have quit employment based on fear for personal safety, after being threatened or assaulted, verbally or physically.  The fact that claimant has been the victim of a crime is not, by itself, a sufficient basis to find good cause for voluntarily leaving continuing employment (<U>Matter of Weinstein</U>, 207 AD 2d 942). A number of factor must be considered to determine, 1) whether claimant's fear for future personal safety is <U>genuine and reasonable</U>, 2) whether claimant has taken appropriate steps to protect him or herself from the abuser and, 3 whether claimant has made an appropriate effort to safeguard employment while attempting to resolve these personal circumstances.</P>
<P>Claimant's ability to take these reasonable steps is, in itself, a factor to consider as well; evidence from claimant's physician, therapist or counsellor would be relevant on this point.  While the actions of a claimant who quits employment are appropriately evaluated against a standard of "what a reasonable person would have done," it should not be ignored that claimant may have had to take immediate steps to address a crisis.  The experience of domestic violence can be characterized as a crisis.  The specific details about claimant's physical and psychological well being are relevant. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">FACT FINDING</P></U>
<P>Fact finding must be done to ascertain the following:</P>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<P>&#9;*What evidence is there that claimant was harassed or assaulted?</P>
<P>&#9;*Was a police report filed?  (Request a copy from the claimant)</P>
<P>&#9;*Did claimant receive medical care or psychological counselling?<br>
       If so, what advice was claimant given? (Request documentation)</P>
<P>&#9;*Where did the assault occur; at the workplace, at home, at some<br>
       other location?</P>
<P>&#9;*Did the assault occur on more than one occasion?  What was the<br>
       most recent incident?</P>
<P>&#9;*Was an Order of Protection sought; if not, why not?  Was it<br>
       granted; if yes, when?  What are its provisions?  (Request a <br>
       copy from the claimant)</P>
<P> </P>
<P>&#9;*Had there been any further attempt by the abuser to harass or<br>
       assault claimant?  If yes, where and when?</P>
<P>&#9;*Was the employer aware of the problem; was a leave of absence <br>
       available to claimant?</P>
<P>&#9;*Could the employer have transferred the claimant to another work<br>
       location?  If so, did the claimant request to be transferred? </P>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">RELOCATION</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>If claimant's leaving of employment resulted form a decision to relocate out of the area, additional considerations arise.</P>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<P>&#9;*Was the claimant's decision to move out of the area based on one<br>
       or more of these factors:</P>
<dir>
<P>&#9;&#9;-loss of, or inability to afford prior residence</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-other financial constraints due to change in family<br>
             income (loss of child care, e.g.)</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-fear of remaining in proximity to the abuser</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-personal preference to return to proximity of other<br>
             family members</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-requirement of personal care (medical, psychological)<br>
             by family member</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-specific recommendation by law enforcement or medical<br>
             professional.</P>
</dir>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ASSAULT AT THE WORKPLACE</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>Prior case law supports the principle that a claimant who has a genuine and reasonable fear for personal safety may have good cause to quit employment, if claimant has been assaulted at the workplace (AB 420,231).</P>
<P>Where claimant was threatened with assault at the workplace by her abusive spouse, she had cause to quit (AB 366,368).  Claimant had frequently been beaten by her husband despite calls to, and in the presence of, the police.  Her husband had threatened to come to the workplace, and had done so when claimant worked for a prior employer.  Claimant was urged by a counsellor to relocate out of the area, given the ineffectiveness of police.</P>
<P>In another case, claimant was separated from her husband for two years.  He continued to threaten her life at her job site and at her home, in spite of two protective orders obtained from the court.  The appeal Board held that claimant's leaving was with good cause (AB 404,527, 2/8/91).</P>
<P>In AB 446, 920, claimant had an affair with a co-worker, and they had a child.  The relationship then ended.  The co-worker harassed claimant on an off the job and physically attacked him.  Claimant filed a police report and advised the employer, who tried to keep the co-worker away from claimant.  The co-worker continued the harassment, threats, and violent incidents.  Claimant resigned after a request for transfer was denied.  He relocated to another state.  The appeal Board held this to be a voluntary quit with good cause.</P>
<P>However, where claimant has declined to press charges when the police have been called, and never sought to obtain an order of protection, good cause has not been found when claimant quit employment to relocate (AB 407,996, 10/29/92).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">OFF THE JOB</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>Where claimant has been a victim of a crime that occurred off the job, at or near home, the decision to relocate to an area beyond commuting distance is not automatically good cause for quitting continuing employment (<U>Matter of Olinger</U>, 176 AD 2d 433; AB 425,175).  Claimant can reasonably be expected to pursue alternate housing arrangements locally, where such could be obtained and afforded.  In the absence of other factors, if claimant has not made reasonable attempts to protect employment by seeking alternate housing locally, good cause is not shown for a voluntary quit (AB 429,101; AB 419,970; AB 418,372; AB 414,898).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">OTHER REASONS FOR RELOCATING</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>If claimant's reason for not seeking housing locally is based on another, non-financial reason for leaving the area, that reason must be explored.  Claimant should be asked to document such advice as may have been given that relocation out of the area was necessary.  Claimant's personal preference to relocate to another area is not good cause in itself for quitting employment (<U>Matter of Zimmerman</U>, 166 AD 2d 862; <U>Matter of Frankel</U>, 26 Ad 2d 866).</P>
<P>One noteworthy case ruled on by the appeal Board involves a claimant who quit employment due to relocation beyond commuting distance (AB 417,527).  This claimant lost his residence as a result of a court order removing him from the family residence, following his assault on his spouse.  Because of an additional order garnisheeing his wages, claimant could not afford housing locally.  The appeal Board ruled that since these circumstances resulted from claimant's assault upon his wife, the "reasonably foreseeable result of claimant's deliberate conduct carries with it the responsibility for its consequences".  Claimant's loss of employment was disqualifying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">ATTEMPTS TO RETAIN EMPLOYMENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>Where claimant has made a reasonable attempt to safeguard employment by requesting a leave of absence in order to resolve problems resulting from domestic violence, her decision to quit in order to relocate out of the area when the request for leave was denied, was with good cause (AB 446,316).  Several months before the last day worked, claimant left her husband who had physically abused her.  She obtained an Order of Protection.  Subsequently she had the order withdrawn and moved back in with her husband.  He resumed the abuse, and began to appear at the workplace and abuse claimant there.  Claimant requested but was denied a leave of absence, to try to resolve the problems.  She moved to Florida temporarily, then returned to NY and obtained another Order of Protection, and filed for divorce.  Claimant has attempted to protect her employment, while taking steps to resolve the problems that arose when she had to relocate away from an abusive spouse.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">DISCHARGE FROM EMPLOYMENT</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>It is also evident that loss of employment due to circumstances arising from domestic violence takes the form of discharge by the employer, due to chronic or prolonged absences.  The basic considerations in these cases are:</P>
<dir>
<P>&#9;*Was the absence due to compelling circumstances?</P>
<P>&#9;*Did claimant take reasonable steps to protect employment by<br>
communicating with the employer and requesting a leave of<br>
absence, if available?</P>
</dir>
<P>The Appeal Board and the Court have long held that a discharge from employment based on circumstances beyond the claimant's control is not disqualifying.  If the claimant was absent because of injury or inability to work, which can be verified through medical report, the remaining consideration is whether the claimant notified the employer.  Since a worker may have rights to job protection under the Family Medical Leave Act, timely notification to the employer is an important consideration.</P>
<P>A claimant who fails to contact the employer when absent for even a short time, may be subject to disqualification if claimant does not have a compelling reason for failing to call or failing to arrange to have the employer notified.</P>
<P>A claimant who is fired for absence due to incarceration is subject to disqualification from benefits, where claimant is convicted of or has pled guilty to a crime.  Incarceration is a foreseeable consequence of an action in violation of the law; a prolonged absence from work due to such incarceration violates a reasonable and implicit condition of employment, regular and prompt attendance.</P>
<P>In closing, separation from employment cases resulting from circumstances involving domestic violence require careful fact finding to determine eligibility for benefits.  In general, numerous factors must be considered to evaluate whether claimant had a genuine and reasonable fear for his/her personal safety, and whether appropriate steps were taken to resolve the personal circumstances and to safeguard employment.  Unusual cases or complex issues of this nature may be referred through normal supervisory channels to the Interpretation Central Services Unit of the Adjudication Services Office.</P>

<BR><BR><BR>Review Letter 2-94<BR>June 1, 1994 <U>
<P align=center>ENTREPRENEURS AND TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT</P></U>
<P>This is the first of a new style of Review Letter which is intended to provide information in an informal fashion to assist Community Services Division personnel in understanding the background of various issues.  These memoranda should be used in conjunction with the Interpretation Service Index and other research materials.  <B>They are not intended to stand on their own as providing policy guidance on any issue.</P>
</B>
<P>The question of when a claimant who wants to start a business becomes not totally unemployed can be better understood by considering the various steps such an individual might take to start a business.  In this discussion we will examine some of those steps, discuss the practical reasons why an individual would undertake them, and comment on their implications for total unemployment.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">EXPLORATORY/INFORMATION GATHERING</P></U></p>
<P>The first group of activities to be discussed is the exploratory or information gathering activities.  Anyone thinking about starting a business would want to know before they do so that such a venture has a hope of success.  There are several key elements to the success of any business venture.  These can best be understood by a series of questions the prospective business person might ask:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Is there a market for the product or service I intend to sell?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Can I sell this product at a price that is competitive with other businesses selling the same or similar product or service?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Do I have, or can I get, enough money to launch this business and sustain myself until the business starts to turn a profit?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>Can I obtain space at a price and in a location to make this business profitable?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">SOURCE OF INFORMATION</P></U></p>
<P>To answer these questions the prospective business person might consult the Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Administration, local banks, and real estate agents.  The Chamber of Commerce would be able to give the prospective business person some indication of the market for his/her product or service in that community.  A business person might also do additional market research including checking the ads in local papers that offer this product or service for sale.  By checking the yellow pages and even making some random calls, a business person could further research product/service demand and price.  The Small Business Administration would be able to provide information on grants and subsidized loans and also some expert guidance.  By consulting a local banker, the prospective entrepreneur could obtain information about the availability of capital, the bank’s willingness to lend money on their business proposition, the interest rates and the general business climate.  One method available to determine the amount of money that a bank is willing to lend is a line of credit.  This represents the maximum amount the bank would lend the business person.  Real estate agents might be questioned to determine both the availability and cost of a site from which to do business.  Of course many small businesses are started in the owner’s home.  None of the actions discussed so far in and of themselves would cause a claimant to lack total unemployment.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">FILING CERTIFICATES/BANK ACCOUNT</P></U></p>
<P>The next group of activities to be discussed brings claimant much closer to lacking total unemployment.  The first of these is the filing of <B>a certificate of doing business</B>.  This protects the name of the concern and allows the holder of such certificate to transact business under that name.  Such certificate can be used to open a business bank account.  It can also be used to apply to the Department of Taxation and Finance for <B>a permit to collect sales tax</B>.  A certificate of doing business (d/b/a) could cost as much as $100.  It may be worth this sum to protect the name under which the prospective business might wish to operate.</P>
<P><B>A business checking account</B> is somewhat more costly than a personal one.  The business check book is rarely provided free and can cost as much as $50 or more for the first order of checks.  There may also be a substantial monthly service charge.</P>
<P>Although there is no filing fee for a sales tax permit, there is no apparent reason to get one unless it is to be used in the immediate future.</P>
<P>Neither of these three elements is conclusive either way as to whether claimant lacks total unemployment.  A claimant could operate a full-fledged business as an individual using a personal checking account.  Conversely, an individual could register a business name to protect it without being ready to operate.  It is possible that any or all of these three steps would not yet cause claimant to lack total unemployment.  However, we would want to know why they were taken, especially if the self-employment activity had not commenced.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LEASE</P></U></p>
<P>The activities that follow will almost certainly show a person is in business and not totally unemployed.  <B>The signing of a lease</B> may follow a period of negotiation during which the terms – amount of rent, duration, services to be provided by the landlord are being negotiated.  This period of negotiation may not constitute employment by itself.  However, the signing usually requires at least two months rent and represents a substantial commitment.  The lessee – the business person – is also usually made personally responsible for the rent each month.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE EQUIPMENT</P></U></p>
<P>The next step, having obtain a business site, (remember that step could be skipped if the claimant is operating out of his/her home) is to <B>purchase or lease the equipment necessary to do business</B>.  In some cases this can be an enormous investment (power brakes, drill presses, etc.) in others none at all (A personal computer may be converted to business use, already owned carpenter’s tools may be used).</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SUPPLIES</P></U></p>
<P>Once there is a site and equipment the next step may be to <B>purchase supplies</B> (a manufacturing or construction business) <B>or inventory</B> (a retail business – on site or mail order).  In a service business, of course, supplies may be minimal (a business service such as computer consultant).  In most retail concerns, the inventory may be extensive, but in some mail order businesses it can follow the solicitation of orders.  Many of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; record offers we see on television, do not manufacture the cassettes or compact discs until orders are received.</P>
<P>A major start up expense is the cost of <B>&quot;stationery.&quot;</B>  This includes business cards, stationery and/or envelopes with the business name and address pre-printed, billing or invoice forms, and literature (such as catalogues), to market the goods or services.  It is important to determine when this stationery was ordered and in what volume.  Note that with imprinted stationery the more you order, the lower the cost per item.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CUSTOMER</P></U></p>
<P>The <B>soliciting of customers</B> is another indication of an operating business.  However, it is important to distinguish between speculative questions and offers to provide goods and services.  There is a substantial difference between &quot;If I could provide you will all day lollipops at ten cents a piece, would you buy?&quot; and &quot;I can ship you as many lollipops at ten cents a piece as you want.  What is your order and how will you pay?&quot;  Once the orders start coming in, a means of receiving and filling them must be in place.  Now the entrepreneur really is in business!</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">THE BUSINESS INSURANCE</P></U></p>
<P>At some point during the founding of a business the entrepreneur will find it desirable to <B>purchase insurance</B>.  This is for the same reason that individuals purchase insurance against fire, theft and liability.  In some cases it may also be necessary to post bonds etc.  All of these are usually the acts of someone who is employed.  Questions prior to employment directed to an insurance agent should be treated similarly to exploratory discussions with bankers.</P>
<p><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">TYPES OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS</P></U></p>
<P>There are basically three types of organizations for a business: sole proprietor, partnership, and corporation.  The legal results of sole proprietorship and partnership are essentially the same.  The difference is that the businessman shares his risk with one or more individuals in a partnership.  The similarity in that the individual(s) are personally liable for the debts and actions of the business.  The advantage of this is easier access to credit.  The owner must repay even if the business fails.  This, of course, is also the major drawback.  The proprietor can lose everything if the business fails.  For this reason most businesses, as soon as they can do so from a credit standpoint, will attempt to incorporate.</P>

<P align=center>ATTENDANCE RELATED SEPARATION ISSUES</P></U>
<OL type=I>
  <LI><U>INTRODUCTION</U> 
  <P>One of the most common separation issues a claims examiner is likely to 
  face is the discharge for attendance related violations. These include absence 
  from work, tardiness and failure to notify the employer when absent. This 
  Review Letter is intended to guide the examiner in the resolution of these 
  separation issues and to establish generally applicable principles through the 
  use of Appeal Board and court decisions. Although not all-inclusive, it is a 
  discussion of commonly encountered situations. As most absenteeism cases 
  involve the discharge of an employee for violation of an attendance rule, the 
  majority of the cases discussed are misconduct issues. Absence constituting 
  job abandonment (voluntary separation) is treated separately in Section 
  VIII.</P>
  <LI><U>
  <P>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</P></U>
  <OL type=A>
    <LI><U>
    <P>Precipitating Incident.</P></U>
    <OL>
      <LI>In resolving separation issues, claims personnel must determine why 
      the claimant lost employment. In most cases this means establishing the 
      precipitating incident which is often described as "the straw that broke 
      the camel’s back".
      <P></P>
      <P>The precipitating incident is the occurrence which was the immediate 
      cause of the employer’s decision to terminate the employment relationship. 
      In attempting to determine the precipitating incident in separation cases, 
      it is essential at the outset of the claims process to establish, usually 
      through the employer, two key factors:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>When the decision was made to discharge and
        <P></P>
        <LI>What specific incident caused that decision to be made </LI></OL>
      <P>Once the reason for discharge has been narrowed down to the particular 
      incident which directly prompted the employer to terminate the employee, 
      and all the facts surrounding that incident have been obtained, the claims 
      examiner must then consider whether or not the claimant’s actions rose to 
      the level of misconduct.</P>
      <LI>One frequently encountered situation is that the "last incident" prior 
      to discharge is not always the precipitating incident. What need be 
      established is which incident resulted in discharge:
      <P></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant C.Y. had received oral and written warnings about 
        punctuality. Nevertheless, she was late on several occasions prior to 
        February 24. From February 24 through February 26, she was absent due to 
        illness. She was discharged for tardiness the following week when the 
        manager responsible for hiring and firing returned from vacation.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board sustained a misconduct determination, finding 
        "nothing in the record to indicate that claimant’s intervening illness 
        was a factor in the decision to discharge her." (A.B. 
      334,794)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>A delay in discharge following the precipitating incident may occur 
      for a number of reasons. For example, in government agencies or large 
      corporations, grievance mechanisms may become operative. Other employers 
      may not discharge an employee until a final approval has been made by a 
      personnel department or company executive. Legitimate delays such as these 
      do not mitigate the effect of the claimant’s action (i.e. lateness, 
      absence, etc.) which prompted the employer’s decision to terminate. 
      However, a considerable delay between the "last incident" and termination, 
      which the employer cannot reasonably explain, may be an indication that 
      the employer did not consider the offense so serious as to warrant 
      immediate dismissal. This, in turn, will raise a question as to whether or 
      not the precipitating incident rises to the level of misconduct. An 
      inordinate delay between offense and discharge may also indicate that the 
      true "last incident" has not been correctly identified and that some other 
      or additional factor prompted the employer’s decision to discharge.
      <P></P>
      <LI>On occasion the precipitating occurrence is not a single circumstance 
      but an accumulation of incidents. This occurs when the employer, 
      dissatisfied with an employee’s attendance and/or punctuality, places the 
      employee on probation, warning the employee that the number of violations 
      will be reviewed at the end of the period. Under these conditions, all 
      attendance violations during the probationary period are to be considered 
      in evaluating the precipitating "incident":
      <P></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant A.B. worked as a probationary office aide for a 
        municipality. Her probationary period had been extended three times 
        because of her poor attendance. The claimant was discharged after being 
        late thirteen times after being given a final warning.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found "The credible evidence establishes that the 
        claimant was warned, in writing, on four different occasions about her 
        poor attendance and that many of claimant’s latenesses thereafter were 
        due to oversleeping. Accordingly, we conclude that claimant’s continued 
        poor attendance was due to circumstances within her control and 
        constituted misconduct in connection with her employment." (A.B. 
        330,990)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When the local office is faced with a mixed bag of attendance 
      violations during a probationary period, a high percentage should be for 
      compelling reasons if the claimant is to be found eligible for benefits. 
      Verification of reasons for all absences during a lengthy probation is 
      desirable but may not be possible because of time restrictions. 
      Nevertheless, verification of at least some of the absences should be 
      attempted to get a feel for the claimant’s overall efforts toward 
      protecting job status.</P></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Exceptions To The Precipitating Incident Requirement</U>:
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>By and large, identifying the reason for discharge is synonymous with 
      identifying the precipitating incident. Nevertheless there are occasions 
      when disqualifications are appropriate even in the absence of any 
      identifiable final incident: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant, a bookkeeper, was frequently late to work and had been 
        warned on several occasions. She reported late almost everyday in the 
        last two weeks of employment.</P>
        <P>In the Appeal Board’s opinion, "That the employer may have delayed 
        discharging claimant, in the hope that her punctuality would improve, 
        does not constitute condonation of her failure to arrive at work on 
        time. There were no compelling reasons for her latenesses." "(A.B. 
        320,654)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Warnings</U>
    <P></P>
    <P>A claimant discharged because of a poor attendance record, but unaware 
    that such conduct would lead to dismissal, generally will not be subject to 
    disqualification. Such awareness may be generated in several ways. Some 
    employers may have formal attendance rules which are distributed to all 
    employees. Others may rely on verbal warnings given to individual employees 
    as needed. Still others may have a formal series of written warnings which 
    culminate in a "final notice"." The form such warnings take is not critical 
    so long as it can be established that the claimant should have been aware 
    that (s)he was following a course of conduct which might lead to discharge. 
    However, dates of such warnings may be relevant since a person would be 
    expected to be more cautious about taking time off after being put on 
    notice.</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Claimant A.M. was given a final warning on June 12 because of 
      latenesses occurring earlier in the month. Although not late or absent 
      thereafter, he was terminated on June 26 because, according to the 
      employer, his attendance record was poor and had failed to improve.</P>
      <P>The Appeal Board overruled the local office determination stating: 
      "...it is significant that after the last warning the claimant’s 
      attendance record showed no absences or latenesses. Under these 
      circumstances…claimant’s actions did not constitute misconduct..." (A.B. 
      330,384)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI><U>Compelling v. Non-Compelling Reason</U> 
    <P>The proverb "absence makes the heart grow fonder" does not pertain to the 
    employment relationship. In fact, there, the saying "out of sight, out of 
    mind" may be more appropriate. Thus, in resolving attendance related 
    separation issues, the reasons for the employee’s absence/lateness must be 
    examined to distinguish between those of a "compelling" or "non-compelling" 
    nature. A compelling reason for the precipitating absence/lateness is, of 
    course, non-disqualifying. </P>
    <P>But, what is compelling? For unemployment insurance purposes "compelling" 
    encompasses more than an absolute need. It includes those reasons of such 
    recognized importance that most individuals would act as the claimant did, 
    even at the risk of losing employment. It is largely a test of the 
    claimant’s reasonableness.</P>
    <P>An absence/lateness reason which is beyond the claimant’s control is 
    clearly compelling: The claimant can do nothing to avoid the incident (e.g. 
    serious accident). At the other end of the spectrum are the reasons which 
    are clearly non-compelling (e.g. "Went to a ball game." "Didn’t feel like 
    working."). In between are an infinite number of reasons which, somehow or 
    other, must be assigned to one category (compelling) or the other 
    (non-compelling).</P>
    <P>A truly compelling precipitating incident will negate the disqualifying 
    effects of a prior poor attendance record. <U>1</U>/ However, a claimant 
    warned about an extremely poor attendance record may be given less credence 
    with respect to the explanation offered for the last attendance violation 
    than a claimant with a good attendance record. <U>2</U>/ In one case the 
    Appeal Board dismissed out of hand claimant’s allegation of illness as the 
    cause of the last absence, noting twice in its opinion that claimant’s 
    frequent absences on Saturdays. (A.B. 343,667).</P></LI></OL><U>

  <OL type=A>
    <LI><U>Illness: Personal and Family</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>If the claimant was discharged as a result of absence due to illness, 
      the separation is generally non-disqualifying. Clearly, inability to work 
      because of illness is beyond the claimant’s control: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant S.C., discharged for excessive absence, was absent January 
        18 and 21 because of a toothache on January 18, and pain from a tooth 
        extraction performed on January 19.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board held: "…claimant’s absences from work were caused by 
        illness. This is not misconduct." (A.B. 334,158)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>When evaluating the eligibility of a claimant suffering from recurring 
      or chronic illness during employment, another factor to be considered is 
      where (s)he has taken reasonable steps to minimize the number of absences 
      other than those compelled by the illness itself? <U>3</U>/ <U>
      <P>3</U>/ Alcoholism, a form of chronic illness often encountered in an 
      absence related discharge, is treated at length in Field Memorandum 6-82. 
      Local offices should refer to that publication for a discussion of that 
      problem.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant R.M. had a chronic back condition for which she was under 
        the care of a doctor and a physiotherapist. She arranged for 
        physiotherapy during non-working hours but her doctor had no evening or 
        weekend hours. She was discharged for excessive absences caused by 
        doctor appointments.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found there was no misconduct: "The employer does 
        not dispute that claimant had a medical problem and that, on most 
        occasions, claimant notified the supervisors, in advance, if she had an 
        appointment which would conflict with her work schedule. Claimant 
        attempted to schedule her appointments so as not to interfere with her 
        work, but was unable to do so to the satisfaction of the employer… 
        Accordingly, she was not subject to any disqualification." (A.B. 
        334,481)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A contrast for the example above is that of the claimant who suffers 
      from a chronic illness but fails to minimize absences:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant D.D. established that during his employment he suffered from 
        an illness (not specified in the decision). However, he did not 
        establish that the illness would render him unable to follow routine 
        treatment recommendations. On October 25, he requested that the employer 
        put him on leave without pay whenever he could not work a full day 
        because of illness, in effect setting his own work hours. His request 
        was denied. Thereupon, claimant was absent from work until November 5, 
        at which time he was discharged.</P>
        <P>The Appellate Division upheld a disqualification, adopting the 
        Board’s finding that, "While claimant appears to be suffering from an 
        illness, he has made no reasonable effort to pursue a course of 
        treatment. An employer is entitled to expect reasonable and prompt 
        attendance from an employee… Claimant’s conduct, therefore, was contrary 
        to the best interest of the employer. It did rise to the level of 
        misconduct…". (<U>Matter of DeCherro</U>, 83 A.D. 2d 709)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Absence due to chronic illness raises the issues of availability and 
      capability. In such cases, claims examiners must also evaluate the 
      claimant’s eligibility with respect to these issues.</P>
      <LI>When family illness is the reason for absence, the compelling nature 
      of the absence is determined not by the illness itself, but rather by the 
      need for the claimant’s care or presence: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant T.E., whose request for Election Day off to coincide with 
        her husband’s day off was denied, took the day off anyway. She later 
        alleged that she had made plans to take her mother for treatment on that 
        day.</P>
        <P>In rejecting the claimant’s contentions, the Appeal Board held, 
        "…while she alleges that she had to help her mother, she testified that 
        she does not drive and she only went because her husband, who does 
        drive, was off." (A.B. 330,771)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>In general, a claimant absent due to illness is under no obligation to 
      provide medical substantiation unless the employer has promulgated a 
      specific rule to that regard. Thus, the claimant’s failure to see a doctor 
      during a short absence, and subsequent inability to produce a doctor’s 
      note, is not necessarily disqualifying. "An individual with a minor 
      illness would not ordinarily be expected to see a physician." (A.B. 
      325,386) 
      <P>However, if a claimant knows the employer’s rules require a medical 
      verification, compliance may be required.</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>When hired, claimant D.B. signed and agreed to a list of employer 
        rules and regulations, including the requirement that absences of three 
        or more consecutive days due to illness of three or more consecutive 
        days be verified with a medical statement. On August 26, claimant 
        received a written warning about his attendance. From September 5 to 
        September 12 he was absent, allegedly due to illness. His supervisor 
        called claimant on September 8, leaving a reminder about the need for a 
        medical note. When claimant reported to work on September 18 without a 
        note he was discharged.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found claimant was correctly disqualified for 
        misconduct. "He gave no valid reason for failing to submit medical proof 
        of his alleged illness. Under the circumstances, claimant’s conduct was 
        detrimental to the employer’s legitimate interest, and was in violation 
        of the employer’s reasonable rule." (A.B. 339,644)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Failure to comply with the employer’s reasonable requirement for 
      medical documentation is not always disqualifying. Factors to consider are 
      the nature of the illness, length of absence, prior attendance record, 
      employee warnings and the employer’s need for verification. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant J.C. suffered a heart attack and was visited in the hospital 
        by a representative of the employer. He signed medical releases to 
        collect disability benefits from the employer’s insurance carrier. 
        Subsequently, he was discharged for failing to provide medical 
        verification of illness.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found no basis for misconduct: "The employer was 
        aware of claimant’s condition when he was hospitalized and while he was 
        receiving disability benefits. Claimant’s condition was verified by the 
        insurance carrier as the agent of the employer. No medical reports from 
        claimant’s doctors sent directly to the employer were needed to 
        establish that claimant could not go back to work. The employer’s 
        demands for such reports were unreasonable because it already had such 
        adequate information through its agent, the insurance company." (A.B. 
        317,278)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>To determine whether a claimant is subject to disqualification for 
      failing to fully comply with an employer’s request for medical 
      documentation, the nature of the request and the degree of compliance must 
      be examined. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant D.P. was hospitalized for an emotional illness. Upon return 
        to work he presented a psychiatric clearance. At the employer’s 
        insistence, claimant produced two more psychiatric opinions confirming 
        the first, but refused to obtain a fourth opinion.</P>
        <P>Overruling a determination of voluntary separation, the Appeal Board 
        found, "…claimant provided more than adequate substantiation that he was 
        fit to return to his job duties."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A different conclusion was reached in the case below:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant C.V., unhappy with her supervisor, took an unauthorized 
        leave of absence. She supplied the employer with medical documentation 
        from a pediatrician indicating that she was suffering from anxiety 
        reaction, secondary to emotional stress at place of employment." Rather 
        than submit to a psychiatric evaluation scheduled and paid for by the 
        employer, claimant quit.</P>
        <P>After determining that she had no compelling reason for refusing to 
        submit to the psychiatric examination, the Appeal Board sustained a 
        determination of voluntary leaving without good cause and noted: 
        "Furthermore, the medical evidence submitted by claimant concerning the 
        necessity for her to leave her employment is not convincing. The 
        diagnosis that claimant was suffering from a psychological disorder was 
        not made by a psychiatrist or psychologist, but by a pediatrician. This 
        doctor’s opinion…was clearly based upon claimant’s subjective and 
        unsubstantiated reports about the conditions of her employment." (A.B. 
        336,472)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Incarceration</U>:
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>When a claimant who commits a crime outside the course of employment 
      is incarcerated, absence from work after warning is disqualifying. (A.B. 
      199,344; A-750-1782) Although it may appear that absence in such cases is 
      beyond the claimant’s control (one does not usually enter jail 
      voluntarily), the Appeal Board has reasoned differently: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant T.E. was on warning for excessive absenteeism. On December 
        7, his last day of work, he was arrested for firing a gun through the 
        wall of a bar. He was incarcerated through January 2 because he could 
        not raise bail bond, and thereafter pled guilty to reckless 
        endangerment. When he returned to work on January 3, his employer had 
        already discharged him for his absence.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found that "The claimant’s last absence resulted 
        from his own delinquency and, therefore, cannot be considered beyond his 
        control under the Law. The claimant’s non-compliance with the employer’s 
        work schedule constituted misconduct." (A.B. 312,143A)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>A conviction for any crime, no matter how minor, is conclusive 
      evidence that the claimant committed the act resulting in incarceration. 
      Similarly, if the claimant pled guilty, even to a lesser charge, "the 
      claimant is subject to the criminal penalties and to whatever effect that 
      may have on his employment: (A.B. 323,831). However, a claimant acquitted 
      in a criminal case may be subject to a misconduct disqualification 
      nevertheless. The standards for determining guilt in a criminal case are 
      substantially greater than those required for unemployment insurance 
      determinations of misconduct (<U>Matter of Colello</U>, No. 76-443 App. 
      Div., 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Dept., Dec 2, 1976, unreported).
      <P></P>
      <P>If no judgment has been rendered by the time an initial determination 
      is to be made, the claims examiner should question the claimant regarding 
      the extent of his/her participation, if any, in the acts alleged. This is 
      necessary even if the claimant pled not guilty since that plea may have 
      been entered for reasons not related to the claimant’s guilt or innocence. 
      If the claimant admits the act, the absence is volitional and may be 
      disqualifying. If the claimant pled not guilty (verify with the 
      appropriate authorities) and signs a statement denying any involvement in 
      the crime, and there is no convincing independent evidence of guilt 
      available, there should be no disqualification. The criminal case should 
      be followed up for disposition, and a redetermination made if 
      warranted.</P>
      <LI>Prior warnings about attendance are generally necessary for a short 
      absence to constitute misconduct. In the case of an incarcerated claimant 
      absent from work for half a day, misconduct was upheld only upon a finding 
      that "He had been warned that he would lose his job if his conduct off the 
      job prevented him from reporting to work on time." (A.B. 221,215) However, 
      incarceration for a lengthy or indefinite period may not require a warning 
      about attendance: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant D.P., sentenced to jail for up to a year, asked his employer 
        to hold his job open for him. The employer refused. Upon release seven 
        months later, claimant reapplied for his job but was not rehired.</P>
        <P>Finding the claimant subject to disqualification for misconduct, the 
        Appeal Board reasoned: "…the claimant was discharged, after beginning 
        his sentence, since he could not report to work while imprisoned. The 
        jail sentence made it ‘impossible,’ not merely impractical or 
        inconvenient, for the employer to continue the employment relationship."

    <LI><U>Loss of Transportation</U> 
    <P>Another common reason for employee absence is loss of transportation to 
    work.</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Where the claimant has limited means of getting to work, and that 
      means becomes unavailable for reasons beyond the claimant’s control, 
      discharge for absence from work is not disqualifying: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant C.O., from a rural area, was absent because his truck broke 
        down. He had no alternative means of going to work.</P>
        <P>In overruling a disqualification for misconduct, the Appeal Board 
        stated:</P>
        <P>"The discharge was precipitated by claimant’s last absence, which was 
        caused by the break down of his own vehicle, his only means of 
        transportation… Claimant’s last absence was the result of circumstances 
        beyond his control." (A.B. 320,419)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Where reasonable alternative means of transportation are available, 
      the claimant’s failure to use them is disqualifying. Absence in such a 
      case is neither beyond the claimant’s control nor reasonable: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant L.G., previously warned about absence, did not report to 
        work on June 25 and 26 because of car trouble. Alternative means of 
        transportation were available.</P>
        <P>In affirming a misconduct disqualification, the Appeal Board held, 
        "Although he had a series of problems with his car, the claimant 
        continued to rely on his automobile as the sole means of transportation 
        to work. He made no attempts to obtain alternate transportation or to 
        use public transportation in order to get to work. Accordingly, we 
        conclude the claimant's last absence from work was for personal and 
        non-compelling reasons..." (A.B. 314,071)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Sudden, unexpected loss of usual transportation, even if alternative 
      means are available, will likely result in the claimant being late for 
      work. Because, from the employer’s viewpoint, lateness is usually 
      preferable to absence, a reasonable employee will make an effort to get to 
      work: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant had only two means of getting to work, riding with an 
        undependable co-worker or riding a public bus which would get him to 
        work late. The claimant had been warned about excessive absenteeism but 
        not about tardiness because the employer was aware of his transportation 
        problems. On the morning of October 26, claimant’s co-worker did not 
        show up. Rather than take public transportation, claimant called the 
        employer to say his ride did not appear and he would be absent. Claimant 
        did not feel like working that day.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found: "The claimant could have taken the public bus 
        and arrived to work late, which the employer would not have objected to, 
        but chose instead not to go in at all. His unnecessary absence on 
        October 26, 1981 after two written warnings was misconduct…" (A.B.

  <LI><U>LATENESS/EARLY DEPARTURE</U> 
  <P>As with absence, a lateness precipitating a dismissal may also be for a 
  compelling reason and non-disqualifying. Some of the more common reasons for 
  tardiness are discussed below.</P>
  <OL type=A>
    <LI><U>Transit Delay</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Tardiness caused solely by an unforeseeable delay in public 
      transportation is not disqualifying: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant G.D. was put on final warning for lateness, usually the 
        result of transit delays. Thereafter, he began leaving home earlier. 
        When he was again late January 19, 20 and 22 due to transit delays, he 
        was discharged.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found no misconduct, noting "…his last three 
        latenesses which precipitated his discharge were due to circumstances 
        beyond his control, that is, transit delays. Claimant’s position that 
        there were extensive transit delays on the last three days was 
        substantiated by verification from the New York Transit Authority." 
        (A.B. 332,783)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>The case above suggests that two factors must be present for the 
      claimant’s tardiness to be non-disqualifying: 
      <P></P>
      <OL type=a>
        <LI>The transit delay should be verified. Most public transportation 
        systems will provide, upon telephone inquiry, the length of any delay 
        and the time at which it occurred.
        <P></P>
        <LI>The transit delay must have been unforeseeable. An employee on 
        warning for lateness should anticipate some delays, but need not 
        anticipate delays on a truly extended duration. Compare the following 
        case with the case above:</LI></OL>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Claimant C.D., on warning for excessive lateness, was late for work 
          five times in his last three weeks of work. He attributed his lateness 
          to train delays.</P>
          <P>Finding the claimant correctly disqualified for misconduct, the 
          Appeal Board stated, "…claimant made no effort to overcome the 
          foreseeable subway delays that he encountered, by leaving for work 
          earlier. The claimant’s continued and excessive lateness which was 
          within his power to avoid, violated an implied condition of employment 
          and thus constituted misconduct in connection therewith." (A.B. 
          311,838)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Traffic Delay</U>
    <P></P>
    <P>Like the public transit commuter, the claimant using private 
    transportation must leave for work early enough to compensate for normal 
    traffic delays. Similarly, delay that is unforeseeable and unexpected will 
    not be disqualifying. In a case of a final lateness caused by flooding on 
    the claimant’s usual route to work, the Appeal Board found there was no 
    misconduct, despite claimant’s history of tardiness and a final warning. 
    (A.B. 341,969)</P>
    <LI><U>Car Trouble</U> 
    <P>Prompt attendance being a requirement of the job, the claimant who uses a 
    privately owned vehicle to go to work must keep it in good working order to 
    comply with the requirement (cf. <U>Matter of Kudysch</U>, 72 A.D. 2d 901; 
    A-750-1894).</P>
    <P>The majority of cases with which the claims examiner deals concern 
    unexpected and unforeseeable car trouble, such as a flat tire or failure to 
    start on an extremely cold morning. Such circumstances are beyond the 
    claimant’s control, and consequently, non-disqualifying. Whenever possible, 
    delays caused by mechanical problems should be substantiated through towing 
    bills, mechanic's bills, receipts for parts, etc. As with public 
    transportation or traffic related delays, habitual lateness due to car 
    trouble can result in disqualification:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Claimant G.H. was discharged for being late 42 times during the 69 days 
      of his employment. The automobile which he used to get to work was in 
      disrepair and frequently broke down.</P>
      <P>The Appeal Board found that "Although the plant manager was aware of 
      claimant’s problems with his vehicle, the credible evidence establishes 
      that claimant was warned repeatedly that he must report to work on time. 
      It was claimant’s obligation to either repair his car permanently or to 
      find other means of transportation…" (A.B. 302,427) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <LI><U>Oversleeping</U> 
    <P>When a claimant is on warning for attendance violations, lateness due to 
    oversleeping is usually disqualifying. However, oversleeping due to the use 
    of a prescription medicine which, unknown to the claimant, causes extreme 
    drowsiness is non-disqualifying. Oversleeping caused by consumption of a 
    non-prescription drug or alcohol is generally disqualifying unless the 
    claimant is an addict or alcoholic. <U>4</U>/ </P>
    <P><U>4</U>/See Field Memorandum 6-82.</P>
    <LI><U>Early Departure</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>The rules with respect to a claimant who leaves work early are 
      substantially the same as for any other absence from work, with one 
      significant exception: Since a supervisor is likely to be nearby, the 
      claimant should seek permission to leave, or at least give notice of 
      leaving to the employer: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant J.V. was on notice for poor attendance. His work hours were 
        8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. he failed to return to work after his break. He 
        informed no one of his leaving nor did he obtain permission to leave. 
        Claimant left because drinking coffee caused him heartburn and he went 
        to a drug store to purchase an antacid.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board upheld the disqualification finding, "The discomfort 
        he experienced was minor in nature and was not so severe as to relieve 
        him of the responsibility of obtaining authorization to leave work 
        early." (A.B. 336,294)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Even if the claimant has a compelling reason to leave, such as 
      personal illness or family emergency, the claimant must still give notice 
      of his departure. Any means reasonably designed to give the employer 
      notice will suffice: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant C.B. became ill shortly after reporting to work. Procedure 
        requires that he notify his immediate supervisor and the personnel 
        office when leaving early. Not being able to locate his supervisor, he 
        informed two co-workers that he was leaving. He called personnel as soon 
        as he got home.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board overruled the employer’s objection to claimant’s 
        eligibility stating, "We conclude that, under the circumstances, 
        claimant substantially complied with the procedure set forth by the 
        employer concerning leaving early." (A.B. 314,939)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>If the claimant’s reason for leaving early is purely personal, mere 
      notice to the employer will not suffice where permission to leave is 
      required but has been denied: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant, a stationary engineer, was required by the employer to take 
        his meal breaks in the building where he worked because it was necessary 
        to have an engineer on the premises at all times. He was paid time and a 
        half for remaining at his post during his meal period. Despite this 
        agreement, on September 13, claimant left the building during his meal 
        break to obtain food. The employer warned the claimant he was violating 
        the rule. October 27, claimant again left the premises to take his meal 
        break and was discharged as a result.</P>
        <P>In reinstating a determination of misconduct, the Appellate Division 
        stated, "Responsible for monitoring the building’s fire detection 
        equipment, it was entirely reasonable for the employer to insist upon 
        his availability should an emergency arise." (<U>Matter of Cruz</U>, 79

  <OL type=A>
    <LI><U>Failure to Call</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>In determining the precipitating incident, care must be exercised in 
      distinguishing whether a claimant has been discharged for an absence 
      itself or for failure to properly notify the employer of the absence. A 
      claimant discharged for failure to properly notify the employer of an 
      absence is subject to disqualification despite the fact that the absence 
      itself was for a compelling reason. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant W.G. informed her supervisor that she would be hospitalized 
        on Monday and Tuesday, April 12 and 13, and that she would return on 
        Wednesday, April 14. However, she did not return to work on either April 
        14, 15 or 16 because she felt discomfort from the medical treatment. She 
        did not call or notify her employer on any of the latter three days, 
        although she knew she was required to do so.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board sustained a disqualification for misconduct. "While 
        she had a compelling reason to be absent on the 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 
        15<SUP>th</SUP> and 16<SUP>th</SUP>, she had no compelling reason for 
        her failure to contact her supervisor… Her failure to contact the 
        supervisor constitutes misconduct…" (A.B. 337,612)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In a similar case the Appeal Board reiterated its longstanding position 
      that when a claimant has been warned about absenteeism it is not necessary 
      that he "…be warned that failure to call in, when absent, can lead to 
      discharge. An employee has a duty to inform his employer in a timely 
      manner of the reason for an absence (A.B. 193,120). He is responsible to 
      get this information to the employer." (A.B. 333,783)</P>
      <P>Thus a claimant discharged for failing to notify the employer of an 
      absence must demonstrate compelling reasons for the absence itself and 
      also for the failure to notify the employer of an absence must demonstrate 
      compelling reasons for the absence itself and also for the failure to 
      call.</P>
      <LI>An employer may require its employees to call at a specific time 
      (e.g., an hour before the start of a shift) in order to secure a 
      replacement or to know what staff is available that day. In such cases, 
      the claimant should make reasonable attempts to comply: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant, a porter, was aware of the employer’s requirement that he 
        call in any absence at least two hours before his 6:00 p.m. shift. On 
        September 24, claimant was ill and at a doctor’s office in the 
        afternoon. He did not inform the employer of his absence until after 
        5:00 p.m. that day. Ill again the next day he did not call until after 
        5:00 p.m.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board sustained a determination of misconduct: "…claimant 
        was discharged because he failed to adhere to the employer’s call-in 
        rule. Significantly…he had been specifically warned about the call-in 
        rule. The fact that the claimant was ill on the days in question does 
        not excuse his failure to make sure that the employer was properly 
        informed of his absences." (A.B. 341,691)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>It should be recognized that a compelling absence may occur so 
      suddenly that the claimant is unable to make a timely call to the 
      employer: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Prior warnings had been given to claimant T.S. about his failure to 
        call in absences at least one hour before the start of his 7:00 a.m. 
        shift. On August 21, at 6:45 a.m., claimant twisted his ankle on the way 
        to work. He was not able to get to a phone until 7:20 a.m., at which 
        time he called the employer. Thereupon he went to a hospital for 
        treatment of a sprained leg and torn ligaments. He was discharged for 
        failing to properly report his intended absence. </P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found no misconduct on claimant’s part. "The nature 
        and extent of his injury made it impossible for claimant to communicate 
        with the employer before 7:20 a.m. It is particularly significant that 
        the injury itself occurred 45 minutes after the 6:00 a.m. deadline for 
        reporting intended absences. Under the circumstances, we must conclude 
        that claimant’s failure to timely notify the employer of his absence was 
        due solely to events beyond his control." (A.B. 282,707)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>The claimant who is unable to meet the call-in deadline is required to 
      notify the employer as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant H.H. worked a shift beginning at 4:00 p.m. She was aware of 
        the employer’s requirement that she call in absences by 11:00 a.m. On 
        November 28, she became ill at about noon and took some medication which 
        could cause drowsiness. She asked a friend to call her at 2 p.m. The 
        friend neglected to call, and claimant, who had fallen asleep, did not 
        wake until 4:30 p.m. She called her employer at that time.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board sustained a disqualification for misconduct, finding 
        claimant "… did not become ill until after 11:00 a.m. on the day in 
        question and thus could not comply with the call-in notice required in 
        the case of usual absences. However, knowing she was still on probation 
        because of her attendance record, claimant did not act reasonably to 
        protect her job. Her choice not to call the employer at noon and to rely 
        on her girlfriend to awaken her if she fell asleep after taking 
        pain-killing medication, was not the action of a prudent and reasonable 
        person, in these circumstances." (A.B. 264,151)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Sometimes the claimant who fails to notify the employer of an absence 
      will receive a call asking if (s)he intends to report to work, and if not, 
      why not? The employer’s call to the claimant does not remedy the 
      claimant’s failure to provide notification. (A.B. 334,124) 
      <P></P>
      <LI>A common explanation for failure to notify the employer of an absence 
      is the claimant’s allegation that (s)he asked a relative or friend to call 
      and that person neglected to do so. This will not excuse claimant’s 
      failure: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant S.L. was absent from work for ten days in order to visit his 
        seriously ill father out of state. He asked his girlfriend to call his 
        employer and explain his absence. She forgot to do so. He was discharged 
        because of his absence without notifying the employer.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board disagreed with "the judge’s conclusion that the 
        claimant’s failure to notify his employer should be excused because he 
        had made a good faith effort to contact his employer by asking a friend 
        to do so. The failure of his chosen agent to notify the employer is 
        attributable to him and it constitutes misconduct on his part…". (A.B. 
        323,434; A-750-1910)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The nature of the relationship between the claimant and the chosen 
      agent does not in any way alter the result. Misconduct was upheld in 
      various cases involving a claimant’s parent, grandparent, child, spouse, 
      uncle, aunt, neighbor and attorney.</P>
      <LI>Frequently cases are seen in which a claimant overstays a vacation or 
      leave of absence. Regardless of the reason for the claimant’s extension of 
      time, the employer may rightfully expect to hear from the claimant at 
      least as early as the date the claimant is due back to work, if not 
      sooner. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant M.W., who was due back from vacation on August 31, did not 
        return until September 8 because his child became ill. He did not 
        contact the employer during the period although he was in contact with 
        his wife in New York and was aware of the requirement to contact the 
        employer during absence.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board noted that claimant’s supervisor testified "neither 
        claimant nor anyone on his behalf contacted him prior to September 8 to 
        report claimant’s absence… Accordingly, we find that claimant lost his 
        employment through misconduct….". (A.B. 331,006)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>False Reason For Absence</U> 
    <P>Providing the employer with a false reason for absence is misconduct. As 
    in failure to call, it is separate offense from the absence. The obligation 
    to inform the employer of the true reason for absence is so vital to the 
    relationship of trust between the employer and employee that a misconduct 
    disqualification is warranted even if the claimant had no prior attendance 
    problems:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>An employer has a right to require on time and regular attendance from 
      its employees, and, to this end, may make rules as necessary. If the rules 
      are reasonable, compliance is expected. 
      <P>Rules limiting the number of absences or latenesses allowed are 
      normally reasonable. Also reasonable are rules requiring the claimant to 
      call in an absence at a specified time and to speak to a specified person 
      or office.</P>
      <LI>Unreasonable employer rules are occasionally encountered and are 
      usually easy to detect. An example is the case in which the employer 
      required a claimant to obtain a fourth medical opinion before returning to 
      work. <U>5</U>/ In another case the Board found an employer’s requirement 
      that the claimant call in an absence which had previously been approved to 
      be unreasonable. <BR><BR><U>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant F.B. was required to verify all of his absences because he 
        had apparently given a false reason for a four-day absence. 
        Subsequently, from July 26 to August 2, he was absent, allegedly due to 
        illness, but did not seek medical attention. He was discharged for 
        failure to provide medical documentation.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board sustained a disqualification for misconduct. It 
        found the employer’s requirement "was reasonable, in view of claimant’s 
        prior actions. Claimant was aware that such failure would result in his 
        termination, yet he did not obtain medical documentation of his 
        illness." (A.B. 339,838)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>Prior penalties or disciplinary suspensions are sufficient notice of 
      what is expected of the claimant. Thus, a claimant who overstayed his 
      lunch break by an hour was held to be on warning for this sort of conduct 
      (and consequently, subject to disqualification) when three years earlier 
      he received a 20-day suspension from work for similar conduct. (A.B.

        <LI>Claimant A.D., on warning for violation of the employer’s call-in

        <P>The Appeal Board concluded that, "He did not act as a reasonably 
        prudent person should to protect his employment… Even if, as claimant 
        testified, the employer’s line was busy on three occasions…claimant 
        should have continued to call. We conclude that a claimant lost his 
        employment through misconduct…". (A.B. 341,263)</P>
        <LI>Claimant J.H. was mugged on August 27 and suffered injuries to his 
        arm, legs, and eyes. He received emergency treatment in a hospital. On 
        August 28, his daughter met with the plant manager, informed him 
        claimant would be out a few days, and gave him a copy of the hospital 
        report. Thereafter, claimant was terminated, pursuant to a union 
        contract provision, for absence of an additional five days without 
        calling in. Claimant had no phone, and because of leg injuries was 
        unable to get to a phone. 
        <P>In this case the Appeal Board found, "claimant made certain that his 
        employer was informed of the seriousness of his condition, and that he 
        would be out for several days. While perhaps he should have made a 
        further attempt to contact the employer during the period he was absent, 
        we note that he has no telephone and was suffering from a leg injury. 
        Under the circumstances, his failure to attempt to keep the employer 
        further apprised of his situation…cannot be said to be misconduct…"

      <LI>If a claimant intends to be absent or late at a future date, (s)he has

        leaving a note on the supervisor’s desk the day before, after the

        <P>The Appeal Board noted, "If claimant could leave a note on the

    <OL>
      <LI>In the law of torts (civil wrongs) there is a well-known adage that 
      "every dog is entitled to its first bite." This means that (in most 
      states, not New York) a dog owner is not liable to the person injured by 
      the dog unless the dog has bitten someone previously, thereby putting the 
      owner on notice as to the viciousness of the animal. 
      <P>Unemployment insurance case law has an analogous doctrine in the 
      single, isolated incident rule: A claimant discharged for a single, 
      isolated violation of a known employer attendance requirement may not be 
      guilty of misconduct:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant, a masseuse, was employed by a concessionaire at a hotel. 
        She was absent one day when she was expected to work and was discharged 
        the following day because of her unexcused absence.</P>
        <P>The Appellate Division held that, "In the present case the finding of 
        misconduct was based on a single unexcused absence. There was no 
        evidence presented that claimant was absent on other days when she was 
        required to work, nor is there any evidence of a warning being given 
        claimant concerning absences. No policy or rule of the employer 
        requiring notification in advance of absence was adduced. In our 
        opinion, this one isolated instance of an unexcused absence does not 
        constitute misconduct…". (<U>Matter of Ramsey</U>, 63 A.D.2d 
      1061)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Also found eligible for benefits were claimants who lost employment as 
      a result of a single, isolated incident of absence because…the claimant 
      forgot his work schedule (A.B. 315,360), was late due to oversleeping 
      (A.B. 315,113) and left a work station ten minutes early (A.B. 
321,992)</P>
      <P>It should be noted, though, that any prior warnings about attendance, 
      even if of a general nature, remove the claimant from the benefit of the 
      isolated incident rule.</P>
      <LI>As one might expect, there is an exception to the rule, in which the 
      claimant is subject to disqualification. A claimant who is solely or 
      significantly responsible for a particular department or whose attendance 
      is essential to the employer’s operation may be subject to 
      disqualification for an isolated instance of absence and failure to call:

        <P>Distinguishing <U>Matter of Ramsey</U> (Page 24), the Appeal Board 
        stated, "The claimant in <U>Ramsey</U> was a masseuse who worked in a 
        large resort hotel and obviously had must less responsibility than 
        claimant had in the present case. The claimant herein was one of only 
        two appetizing department clerks. His failure to report to work on the 
        date in question, of necessity, could result, and did result, in the

  <LI><U>CREDIBILITY</U>
  <P></P>
  <P>As Oscar Wilde once observed, "Truth is rarely pure and never simple." 
  Therefore, it is not surprising that one of the more difficult problems facing 
  a claims examiner in resolving separation issues is testing the credibility of 
  the parties. In the area of attendance related discharges, evaluating 
  credibility is more difficult because often only the claimant knows the reason 
  for the absence or lateness. This section explores means of evaluating 
  credibility.</P>
  <OL type=A>
    <LI><U>Verification</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Proper interviewing technique requires that the credibility of any 
      individual with exclusive knowledge of necessary facts be tested. The best 
      means of certifying a statement is through independent sources outside the 
      control of either the claimant or the employer. For example, the Weather 
      Bureau would be able to provide information tending to confirm a 
      claimant’s statement that an absence was caused by heavy snow. Other forms 
      of independent verification frequently available and which the claims 
      examiner should utilize include traffic and transit reports, police 
      reports, medical documentation, and repair bills. The following case 
      illustrates the importance of independent verification in evaluating the 
      credibility of claimant’s explanation for the last absence/lateness. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant W.J. had been absent 27 times between January 1, 1981 and 
        September 18, 1981 when he was discharged. He had been on written 
        warning for excessive absenteeism. He insisted that his last absence was 
        compelled by his girlfriend’s hospitalization. He was discharged at 
        10:56 a.m. on September 18.</P>
        <P>The Appellate Division sustained the disqualification for misconduct, 
        noting, "The record is clear that claimant did not take his girlfriend 
        to the hospital on September 17, 1981 but at 3:50 p.m. on September 18, 
        1981, some five hours after he had been notified at 10:56 a.m. that his 
        employment had been terminated." (<U>Matter of Johnson</U>, 89 A.D. 2d 
        1050)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <LI>On occasion, the employer may have evidence tending to support or 
      refute the claimant’s statement. A typical example is the employer’s 
      possession of a signed acknowledgement of warning, refuting the claimant’s 
      contention that (s)he was never warned. Note also the following example: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Claimant C.B. was absent 13 times in four months and had been warned. 
        He was discharged. Claimant contended he was totally dependent upon a 
        particular co-worker to get to work, and that his absences were caused 
        by the co-worker’s absences.</P>
        <P>Unpersuaded, the Appeal Board sustained a disqualification for 
        misconduct. "We reject such contention in light of the employer’s 
        attendance records showing the claimant reported to work on many 
        occasions that the co-worker did not report to work." (A.B. 
      337,675)</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Inconsistent Statements</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Occasionally a statement will be self-contradictory or otherwise 
      incredible. The Appeal Board recently rejected a claimant’s contention 
      "that she failed to contact the employer on each day of her absence 
      because she was too emotionally distressed, in view of her testimony that 
      she would have complied with the rule if she had known she would be 
      discharged for its violation." (A.B. 334,024) 
      <P>At times, it is the employer’s statement that proves to be incredible. 
      For example, the Appeal Board rejected an employer’s allegation of 
      misconduct and found a claimant eligible for benefits, in part because 
      despite the employer’s contention of discharge for latenesses, the 
      claimant had been told he would not be dismissed if he agreed to drop an 
      earlier union grievance against the employer. (A.B. 341,468)</P>
      <LI>There is a rule of evidence that statements made by a party at a time 
      (s)he has no reason to believe they will be used adversely may be given 
      more weight than subsequent inconsistent statements or testimony, even if 
      given under oath.
      <P></P>
      <P>This principle applies to unemployment insurance cases. For example, a 
      claimant’s statement to the local office that his last lateness was caused 
      by a family medical emergency might be viewed with skepticism if he had 
      told the employer at the time of his dismissal that he had been late 
      because he overslept. Similarly, at the hearing or appeal level, 
      statements made by the claimant or employer which conflict with those 
      given to the local office before their effect was known may be found less 
      credible (Cf. <U>Matter of Jensen</U>, 49 A.D. 2d 794). For this reason, 
      it is of the utmost importance for the claims examiner to obtain precise, 
      detailed and complete statements from all parties.</P></LI></OL>
    <LI><U>Patterns of Absence</U>
    <P></P>
    <OL>
      <LI>When a claimant alleges an absence was due to illness or other 
      compelling reason but cannot provide documentation, the claims examiner 
      should look to the claimant’s attendance history to see if there is a 
      pattern of absence: for example, absence on Fridays or Mondays, the day 
      following pay day, or as leave time accumulates. If a precipitating 
      absence falls within a pattern, it should be scrutinized carefully. While 
      the claims examiner should not automatically exclude the possibility that 
      the claimant did have a compelling reason for the last absence, a 
      precipitating absence falling within a pattern of absences is strongly 
      suggestive of non-compelling, and thus disqualifying, reason for absence. 
      The following cases are illustrative: <BR><BR>
      <OL type=a>
        <LI>Claimant, a security guard, worked for a hospital. She had been 
        discharged for absenteeism, but rehired with a warning that her 
        attendance would be closely monitored. Thereafter, claimant was absent 
        three times, all on Sundays. She requested Monday, February 14, 1983 as 
        a day off, then failed to report to work on Sunday, February 13.
        <P></P>
        <P>The Appeal Board rejected the administrative law judge’s conclusion 
        that claimant’s last absence was an "honest mistake", finding "…she was 
        fully aware that she was required to work on Sunday, February 13, 1983. 
        Her failure to report to work on Sunday, February 13, 1983 was contrary 
        to the employer’s interests… Therefore, we find that claimant’s 
        employment came to an end due to misconduct in connection therewith." 
        (A.B. 346,644)</P>
        <LI>Claimant H.D., on warning for poor attendance, was absent three 
        consecutive Mondays prior to his discharge. On the last Monday, the 
        absence precipitating his discharge, he was required to be in Family 
        Court to contest a support action. He called his employer in the morning 
        to notify it that he would be late and again, later on, that he would 
        not be in at all. He was in court all day.
        <P></P>
        <P>The Appeal Board found that, "Though his attendance record may have 
        been poor, his last absence was for a compelling reason. Accordingly, 
        claimant did not lose his employment through misconduct…". (A.B. 
        331,708)</P></LI></OL></LI></OL></LI></OL>
  <LI><U>ABANDONMENT OF JOB: VOLUNTARY SEPARATION</U>
  <P></P>
  <OL>
    <LI>A bothersome side issue often found in absence-related separation is the 
    question of which disqualification, voluntary quit or misconduct, is 
    appropriate when a claimant becomes separated from employment because of a 
    substantial absence without proper notification to the employer. Did the 
    claimant quit, or was the claimant discharged as a result of the absence? 
    Any difficulty in resolving this problem is substantially diminished by the 
    application of a simple rule: <U>Impose both disqualifications</U>, 
    misconduct and voluntary separation, one as an alternative to the other. 
    <P>Because neither an administrative law judge nor the Appeal Board may 
    issue initial determinations, both determinations must be issued to insure a 
    decision on misconduct and voluntary leaving. If only one determination is 
    issued and it proves incorrect on appeal, the administrative law judge or 
    appeal Board must overrule it and cannot issue the alternative in its place 
    (<U>Matter of Pepitone</U>, 78 A.D. 2d 563).</P>
    <LI>In deciding which of the two determinations is primary and which is 
    alternative, the claims examiner should look to the claimant's intent. If 
    the claimant made an attempt to keep the job during an absence, or attempted 
    to return to work following an absence, there was no intent to abandon the 
    job and the primary determination is misconduct. 
    <P>On the other hand, if the claimant reported to the employer for the sole 
    purpose of picking up his paycheck, the intent was to leave and the primary 
    issue is voluntary separation.</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Claimant R.P. was given a final warning not to bother reporting to work 
      anymore if he were absent again. On June 8, he was absent because of car 
      trouble. He neither called the employer nor attempted to get to work by 
      other means of transportation. He reported to the employer on June 10 for 
      the sole purpose of picking up his last paycheck.</P>
      <P>The Appeal Board sustained a disqualification for voluntary separation 
      finding "He made no attempt to get to work or to protect his employment on 
      the occasion of his last absence, and only returned to the employer’s 
      establishment on June 10, 1982 to collect his pay check… In view of the 
      aforesaid, it is unnecessary to rule on the alternate initial 
      determination of misconduct." (A.B. 338,089)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>On the contrary, if the claimant, intending to work, reported to the 
    employer’s premises after an unauthorized absence, was handed his paycheck 
    and discharged, the primary determination is misconduct:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Claimant S.K. was absent from January 8 to January 11, because he was 
      ill. Although he was required to call in his absence, he deemed it 
      unnecessary. He reported to work on January 12, at which time was given 
      his final paycheck and discharged. </P>
      <P>The Appeal Board overruled a disqualification for voluntary separation 
      but sustained the alternative determination of misconduct. "Claimant did 
      not intend to abandon his employment or resign and was ready to work on 
      January 12, 1982. We find the employer’s actions on January 12 to be a 
      discharge. Accordingly, the claimant’s separation from employment was 
      involuntary and there is no basis for the initial determination 
      disqualifying the claimant from receiving benefits because he voluntarily 
      left his employment without good cause… Under the circumstances, we find 
      that the claimant’s conduct constitutes misconduct…".

<P>CONCLUSION</P></U>
<P>Difficulty in the resolution of attendance related separation issues will be 
substantially reduced if certain fundamental principles are borne in mind:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>It is always necessary to identify the precipitating incident leading to 
  discharge. Generally, this will be the final attendance related violation 
  prior to the employer’s decision to discharge the claimant. However, in 
  exceptional cases it may be an accumulation of incidents, especially if 
  occurring during a predesignated probation period. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Absence or tardiness after warning is misconduct, unless the claimant had 
  a compelling reason to be absent or late. <BR><BR>
  <LI>A discharge for failing to comply with an employer’s reasonable rule is 
  disqualifying, unless the claimant demonstrates a compelling reason for the 
  failure. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Whenever possible, claimant and employer allegations should be verified 
  with records (e.g. mechanic’s bill, copy of warning) or through disinterested 
  sources (e.g. transit authority). However, a claimant is not expected to 
  produce a doctor’s note for a minor illness or short duration unless (s)he has 
  been specifically warned by the employer that one is required. <BR><BR>
  <LI>If the facts of the case do not clearly establish whether the claimant 
  abandoned employment or was discharged for misconduct, alternative 
  determinations of voluntary separation and misconduct must be 
issued.</LI></OL>
