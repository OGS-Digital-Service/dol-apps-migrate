cook, six days a week. Her hours of employment were from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. On the morning of April 2, 1975 claimant called her employer and reported
that she was too ill to work and arranged to have her daughter fill in as her
replacement. When her husband drove her daughter to work she accompanied him.
Then they both went to play bingo. On April 5, 1975 she reported for work and
when questioned by her employer, admitted that she had not been ill on April 2
but had gone to play bingo instead. She was then discharged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant called her employer to report that she could not work because she was
ill and then went to play bingo. Her false report as to the reason for her
absence and her failure to report for work constitute misconduct in connection
with her employment. It is significant that claimant presented no medical
evidence in substantiation of her contention that she was ill. Accordingly, we
conclude that claimant lost her employment through misconduct in connection
with her employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

operator, was discharged for reporting to work with the odor of alcohol on his
breath after having previously been warned not to do so. In a prior
appeal&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Llano&nbsp;</u>[<u>Levine</u>], 46 A D 2d 841), we
remitted this case to the appeal board for a determination of whether
claimant's conduct constituted misconduct in the light of&nbsp;<u>Matter of
James (Levine</u>), (34 N Y 2d 491). On the present record, there is no
evidence that claimant was guilty of drinking on the job. In fact, the board
has specifically found that claimant's consumption of alcohol occurred on the
previous evening. There is no evidence that claimant was intoxicated, or in any
way impaired so as to create a dangerous situation or affect his ability to
function. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of James (Levine</u>), supra, by contrast, the
claimant reported to work &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; ('34 N Y
2d at 497). Moreover, the claimant in&nbsp;<u>James</u>&nbsp;was in a position
where she had contact with customers. Here, there is no testimony that claimant
had contact with customers or made the working environment unpleasant for
co-employees, and the board has not found that the mere odor on claimant's
breath adversely affected the employer's interests (see&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Paulsen [Catherwood]</u>, 27 A D 2d 493). In fact, claimant has testified
without contradiction that he was not discharged until the end of the work day,
which suggests that claimant's &quot;condition&quot; was not adverse to his
employer's interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant did not actively seek a residence in Nassau County and that the waiver
of the residency requirement was expressly conditioned upon such activity on
the part of the claimant and that his voluntary act of not seeking and
acquiring a Nassau County residence required his involuntary termination. This
was a factual determination solely within the province of the board and, since
it is supported by substantial evidence, it must be affirmed. While the
doctrine of provoked discharge has been considerably narrowed (see&nbsp;<u>Matter
of James</u>[<u>Catherwood</u>], 34 NY 2d 491), it is appropriately applied to
the instance of the &quot;involuntary&quot; discharge by an employer for cause
flowing from the &quot;voluntary&quot; act or acts of the employee (<u>Matter
of James</u>&nbsp;<u>[Catherwood</u>], supra). (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Malaspina&nbsp;</u>[<u>Corsi</u>], 309 N.Y.413.) The decision of the board

department store from September 1, 1971 until February 13, 1975. The employer
had a rule prohibiting the careless handling of store assets. Claimant was
aware of this rule. On December 31, 1974, while claimant was handling a sale
money was stolen from her cash register which she had carelessly left open.
Claimant received a warning as a result of such incident. Thereafter on
February 12, 1975 about five minutes before claimant's closing time, she placed
an envelope with the contents of the cash register on a counter while she
waited on a customer. While so doing, another customer stole a sum of money
from the envelope. Because of this incident she was terminated the following
day because of gross negligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

agreement. It further states that if the collective bargaining agreement is
silent as to such time, then the time designated by the employer in writing and
announced to the employees in advance is the &quot;vacation period.&quot; There
exists a collective bargaining agreement to which the employer and claimant are
parties. Article 7, Section 4 thereof states: &quot;vacations will be bid between
January 17 and February 15, and posted before March of each year.&quot; Since
there is no provision for fixing a vacation period other than the foregoing
provision for the bidding of vacation periods by employees, the employer had no
right to unilaterally designate a vacation period for the claimant. Since the
claimant did not bid for the vacation period, in accordance with the agreement,
the unilateral action of the employer does not establish a paid vacation period
under Section 591.3 of the Law. Claimant was eligible to receive benefits for
the period in issue herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

day was spent away from Rhinebeck and on the premises of its customers, DeGrego
was provided with a uniform bearing: his employer's name. The record is devoid

president of the company who advised him that he could not wear the button if
he wished to keep his job. Although no complaints or response had been received
from customers, the employer felt that this button could affect Rhinebeck's
relationship with its clientele. DeGrego refused to remove the button claiming
that he was entitled to express a strongly felt political statement. As a
result of this refusal he was fired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

refusing to comply with a reasonable directive from his employer. This
determination was sustained by a referee and the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board who found that DeGrego had provoked his discharge which was the
equivalent of voluntary leaving employment without good cause, In a proceeding
to review this denial of benefits the Appellate Division reversed stating that
unemployment benefits could not be denied where the discharged employee was
exercising his freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution (46 AD2d
253), We affirm but deem it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue in

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Provoked discharge, a
gloss over the statutory disqualification for voluntary separation without good
cause (Labor Law §593 subd, 1) is a narrowly drawn legal fiction designed to
apply where an employee voluntarily engages in conduct which transgressed a
legitimate known obligation and leaves the employer no choice but to discharge
him, In such a case the agency is entitled to put substance over form and to
conclude that the employee voluntarily left his job without good cause. This
approach was first recognized by our Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Malaspina
[Corsi</u>] (309 NY 413). There, provoked discharge was considered applicable
where a collective bargaining agreement mandated the discharge of those who
refused to join the union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

subject to arbitrary application and was inappropriately extended without
statutory authority, our Court in&nbsp;<u>Matter of James [Levine].</u>&nbsp;(supra,
34 NY2d 491) adopted a very strict view of it. We made it clear that a denial
of unemployment insurance benefits due to provoked discharge would be sustained
only where the employer has no range of discretion but was called to terminate
employment. In addition,&nbsp;<u>James</u>&nbsp;recognized that although
provoked discharge might be inapplicable, the actions of the employee may
amount to misconduct thereby disqualifying him from benefits. By the same
token; where the employee has not provoked discharge or engaged in misconduct
he will be entitled to benefits despite the fact that the employer may have
fired the employee for valid reasons. As noted in&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Heitzenratter [Hoboken Chem. Corp.]</u>&nbsp;(19 NY2d 1, 9-10) this possibility
was &quot;designedly incorporated in the legislative scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the employer's interest or in violation of a reasonable work condition so as to
constitute misconduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

erroneous contention pressed by the dissent that DeGrego deliberately left his
employment we need only look to the findings of fact which were made by the
referee who conducted the hearing and which were adopted en toto by the Appeal
Board. After a review of the testimony and evidence adduced at the hearing the
referee explicitly found as a matter of fact that the claimant was&nbsp;<u>discharged</u>&nbsp;as
a result of his failure to remove the button. This clear and unequivocal
finding is supported by the record which includes DeGrego's testimony, the sole
witness at the hearing, that he did not leave voluntarily but was discharged,
Section 623 of the Labor Law provides that a decision by the referee which is
adopted by the Appeal Board is final and conclusive on all questions of fact.
The dissent's apparent reliance on the notice of ineligibility which was sent
to DeGrego prior to the hearing is misplaced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

work uniform that impliedly advocated the impeachment of the President of the
United States. On the second day the president of the firm requested that
claimant not wear the button to work on the ground that &quot;it was
detrimental to his business.&quot; Claimant refused and was fired. If the
claimant had removed the button, he would not have been discharged. In a report
of employment filed with the State Department of Labor, the employer reported
that the claimant &quot;left because we would not allow him to wear a political
button on our Rhinebeck Plbg. uniform. We felt the button could affect our
relationship with the customers. We informed him that there was [sic] no
personal feelings involved, but the manner in which he conducted himself during
working hours could also reflect against Rhinebeck Plbg's name. This in turn
could affect the outlook for the entire company.&quot; Claimant's application
for unemployment insurance benefits was denied by the Industrial Commissioner
upon the ground that he &quot;quit (his) job without good cause.&quot; This
determination was sustained by a referee and the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board affirmed. The Appellate Division, Third Department, reversed, finding

penalizing the claimant for exercising his right to freedom of speech. (46 AD2d

Unemployment Insurance Law provides that an employee who voluntarily leaves his

set forth the tests to be applied in assessing the applicability of, the
statute to a given set of facts. Voluntary separation is usually &quot;confined
to the giving up of employment permanently or temporarily, without cause or
justification.&quot; (34 NY 2d at p 498) on the other hand, where an employee
is discharged for valid cause, the cause must &quot;rise to the level of
misconduct before an employee becomes ineligible to receive benefits.&quot; (34

insistence upon a narrow reading of the referee's findings of fact, it is
manifest that the administrative officials, at all levels of. the adjudicatory
process, found that the claimant voluntarily left his employment, rather than
comply with a reasonable rule established by his employer. The Industrial
Commissioner specifically determined that the claimant &quot;quit&quot; his
job. The referee, after a hearing, concluded that &quot;[t]he initial

great reliance on the statement in the referee's descriptive findings of fact
that claimant &quot;was discharged as a result of his failure&quot; to remove
the button. Ignored is the fact that the referee, in his decision, sustained
the initial determination by the Industrial Commissioner that the claimant
voluntarily quit his job. Indeed, in the course of the hearing, the referee
stated: &quot;I am prepared to find that the claimant quit his job because he
was given an option, and he could have continued to work for the employer by
complying with the employer's direct request, and he chose not to, and
therefore, he left the job.&quot; When the claimant's attorney protested this
proposed finding, the referee cut him off with the comment that &quot;the facts
are clear here&quot;. He referee went on to explain that the claimant &quot;was
given an option to comply with the request or the directive or not, and he
could have continued to work there, but he chose not to do so, and it was up to
him, and he took action, and there is no way that can be interpreted any other
way…&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The sole conclusion to
be drawn from this record is that the claimant was given the option of
continuing his employment relationship under rules established by the employer.
The granting of such an option is hardly consonant with the air of finality
that attends ultimate discharge. A fair reading of the record belies the
interpretation effected by the majority. The court obfuscates what was
eminently clear to the labor officials who determined this case, that the
claimant voluntarily left his job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Moreover, the majority
confuses voluntary separation without good cause with the doctrine of provoked
discharge. Voluntary separation occurs when the employee without valid cause or
justification, declines to continue his employment. In this case, the claimant
deliberately left his employment rather than comply with a reasonable condition
of employment. A provoked discharge, on the other hand, is a discharge by the
employer necessitated by governmental regulation or union bargaining agreement.
The classic example is a discharge mandated by the employee's refusal to abide
by a union shop provision in a collective bargaining agreement. (<u>Matter of
Malaspina [Corsi</u>], 309 NY 413). In both voluntary and provoked discharge an
act of the employee is the producing cause of the termination. The same might
be said of employee misconduct, which even the majority concedes will result in
ineligibility. The critical distinction between voluntary separation and
provoked discharge is that the former is voluntary leaving of employment by the
employee without good cause, whereas the latter is an involuntary discharge by
the employer of the employee for good cause. The doctrine of provoked discharge
must be carefully limited since it is but &quot;a legitimate and essential
gloss of the statute to fill a gap&quot; (<u>Matter of James [Levine],</u>&nbsp;34
NY2d at p 495, supra.) On the other hand, a voluntary separation without good
cause must create ineligibility since the Legislature has specifically required
that it should. It is for this reason that the crucial fact is not, as the
majority views it, that the employer might not have chosen to fire claimant,
what is significant is that the claimant chose not to work for the employer
rather than comply with work rules established by the employer and found to be
reasonable by State labor officials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>An employer whose
employees come into contact with members of the public may reasonably require
that the employees refrain from conduct that might trigger adverse public
reaction. (<u>See Eastern Greyhound Lines Division of Greyhound Lines v New
York state Division of Human Rights,</u>&nbsp;27 NY2d 279;<u>&nbsp;Matter of
Gladstone [Catherwood]</u>, 36 AD2d 204, affd 30 NY2d 576, supra). The need for
such regulation is particularly acute where the employees perform their duties
in homes or on the private property of customers. Common experience reveals
that the employer will be held responsible for employee actions that the client
deems noxious or offensive. The average employer has no interest in acting as a
self-appointed community censor. The real concern, and it is a valid one, is
that the employer will be financially damaged as a result of consumer
unhappiness with the actions of his employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is a commonplace fact
of the human experience that disputes or disagreements over controversial
subjects may arouse anger or animosity in the participants to the discussion.
Passions may be particularly inflamed by adverse comments directed at respected
or venerated community leaders. In this case, the employer had every reason to
be concerned that some of his customers might be offended by criticism of the
President of the United States. The occupant of that office is generally widely
admired and respected. The employer could reasonably fear that a button,
sported by his employee, suggesting that the President should be impeached
might offend the sensibilities of some of his customers. At the very least, it
might touch off a rancorous political debate which could arouse a customer's
ill-will. An employer should be able to protect himself against that
eventuality by requiring that his employees, during business hours, refrain
from overt political activity. Moreover, the employer is not required to take a
poll or otherwise measure the likelihood that his customers will react
adversely to his employee's political views. The majority's insistence that the
employer prove that the employee's conduct was detrimental to his business
interest is both irrelevant and naive. It is sufficient if the employer believe
that his business will be adversely affected by the employee's conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Denying an employee
unemployment insurance benefits for failure to abide by a reasonable regulation
of employee conduct does not involve state infringement of the employee's First
Amendment rights. The freedom of speech is not an absolute right. It is subject
to reasonable regulations under certain circumstances. (See, e.g.,&nbsp;<u>Tinker
v</u>&nbsp;<u>Des Moines Independent Community School District,</u>&nbsp;393 US
503, 513). Expression may be &quot;basically incompatible with the normal
activity of a particular place at a particular time.&quot;&nbsp;<u>(Grayned v City
of Rockford,</u>&nbsp;408 US 104, 116). Entrance into an employment
relationship necessarily entails some reduction in personal liberty. An
employer may require, within reason, that an employee report to work at a given
place, at a given time, dressed in a certain manner, that the work be done in
accordance with established practices, that the employee heed the instructions
of his supervisors and that fellow employees be permitted to work undisturbed.
These restrictions are normally accepted by our society as necessary for the
orderly conduct of a business and as part of the process by which one earns a
livelihood. Persons who are unwilling to abide by reasonable regulations are,
of course, free to decline employment. However, refusal to comply with
reasonable work regulations should preclude receipt of unemployment insurance
benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;(374 US 398) is not to the contrary. In
that case, an employee was denied unemployment insurance benefits because of
her refusal to accept Saturday work for religious reasons. The court ruled that
government could not permissibly require an employee to choose between
abandoning the precepts of her religion in order to work and, on the other
hand, following her religion and forfeiting unemployment insurance benefits.
(374 US at p 404). The effect of the state rule under consideration in&nbsp;<u>Sherbert</u>&nbsp;was
to penalize the employee for holding a particular religious belief. Withholding
unemployment insurance benefits where the employee insists on being able to
make political statements to members of the public on company time, to the
possible detriment of the business, does not penalize the employee for holding
a particular belief. Nor does it require t the employee to take an affirmative
action in violation of his conscience. (<u>Matter of Moran (Catherwood</u>], 34
AD2d 694, affd 27 NY2d 946). Rather, it is an affirmation of the general rule
that an employer is not obligated to permit his employees to engage in overt
political activity during business hours. The employee is not constrained to
abandon his political opinions (see&nbsp;<u>Sherbert v. Verner</u>, 374 US at p
410, supra), but may not insist on expressing them on his employer's time to
his employer's customers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bank from December 22, 1969 through August 26, 1975. On August 26, 1975 he was
placed on probation for poor work performance and excessive absences. A
probation report was typed indicating the reasons and probable causes for
probation. He was asked to sign his name in the space on the probation form
designated &quot;employee acknowledgement&quot;. It stated in print that he had
read the reasons for probation and probable causes and that by signing his name
he did not necessarily express agreement with them. Claimant refused to sign
the probation form contending its contents were false. He was sent to
personnel, given an additional opportunity to sign the form and when again he
refused, was immediately dismissed. If claimant had signed the form he would
not have been dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

held that discharge because of refusal to sign an acknowledgement of the
imposition of a probation period because of unsatisfactory work performance, is
not disqualifying, when signature would be an admission of being an unsatisfactory
employee. In that case the Board indicated claimant was justified in refusing
to agree to something she did not believe was the truth. (A.B. 137,392; not
reported). The instant case is distinguishable in that the form expressly
stated that signature did not mean agreement with the reasons for the
probation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quits to be with good cause, on the ground that claimants lost their living

that membership in a family unit which moves does not in itself constitute good
cause for leaving employment; good cause exists only if, apart from the fact of
such membership, a compelling reason exists for remaining with the unit.
Inability to subsist alone is one such compelling reason. (The fact. that a
claimant is under 18 years of age is also a compelling reason to remain with a
family unit that moves).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

telephone was removed for non-payment of his bills. He thereupon installed an
illegal phone connected to the telephone line of a neighbor without the
latter's knowledge. He was discharged when the scheme was discovered. A
disqualification for misconduct in connection with employment was upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

precious metals working company for approximately five years as a supervisor
until January 21, 1976. In the course of an investigation, the claimant was
found to have a quantity of gold alloy locked in his toolbox, which he kept on
the employer's premises. Dissatisfied with claimant's explanation of this, the
employer asked him to take a polygraph test. The claimant initially agreed but
later Changed his mind and refused, as he bad on prior occasions. Although he
was not formally discharged, it was made clear to him that he would not be
allowed to return to work if he did not take the test. When he continued to refuse
to do so, he was told to take home his toolbox. At no time was the claimant
accused by the employer of stealing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

known as &quot;lie-detector&quot;, has been adopted by some business
establishments seeking to control employee dishonesty. By recording changes in
a subject's blood pressure and pulse rate as he answers questions, this device
is supposed to show when he is lying. However, the test is generally considered
not infallible, since some people can lie without any appreciable physiological
changes being recorded, while others may give truthful answers while causing
the indicators to oscillate vigorously. Not surprisingly, the results of
polygraph testing are not admissible as evidence in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Board cases cited in this decision, benefits were, allowed to claimants (a
cashier in A.B. 127,442 and a security guard in A.B. 168,381) who were discharged
for refusing to take a polygraph test. The cashier's case is of special
interest because at time of hire she had signed an agreement to submit to such
a test if and when required, thus making it a condition of her employment. In
effect it was contended that claimant had waived her rights. The Board rejected
that argument, stating that the condition was unreasonable and claimant was
justified in refusing to adhere to it. The decision was reported in release
A-750-1648, and, though the rule was later removed from the Interpretation
Service, a re-reading of the Boards opinion in that case is recommended for the
insight it provides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

most of the base period. He worked full-time for about two months after the
close of school in the Spring of 1974. When the local office was unable to
obtain confirmation from the employer because claimant had not furnished the
correct name the claimant submitted pay stubs reflecting only his full-time
employment. The claimant signed a form certifying that his base period earnings
were $10,500. This form advised the signer that the law provided severe
penalties for wilful false statements to obtain benefits. Based on this
information, the claimant's base period earnings were calculated to be $10,500.

fixture manufacturing company for about 17 years. For about the last year and a
half, he served as an assistant foreman. In May, 1976, the union and the
employer entered into a new contract. Under the contract, assistant foremen
were included in the group of supervisors who were ineligible for membership in
the union. Prior to this time, the claimant had been a member of the union. He
was unaware of the new contract's effect on his membership. In August, 1976,
the employer sent an internal memo to the union listing claimant and several
other employees who were no longer in the bargaining unit. On September 9,
1976, the claimant was told that he was not eligible for union membership,
while completing forms for hospitalization coverage. He objected that he wished
to retain his union membership. That afternoon, officials of the employer met
with the claimant and directed him to continue to work as an assistant foreman
and not do the work of a welder. The claimant refused to serve as a supervisor
and was discharged for that refusal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an assistant foreman and, as (assistant) foreman, became ineligible for union
membership effective in May, 1976. This was a substantial change in the terms
and conditions of his employment. He was unaware of this change until September
9, 1976 at which time he elected to maintain his union membership. The
employer's refusal to honor claimant's election would constitute good cause to
quit the employment (Section 593.1(a) of the Law) since circumstances had
developed which would have justified a refusal of such employment in the first
instance, namely interference with joining or retaining membership in any labor
organization (Section 593.2(a) of the Law). In view of the foregoing, the
claimant's refusal to do supervisory work does not constitute insubordination
and therefore is not misconduct. Although the union bad agreed that the
claimant should no longer be a member by accepting the new contract, the
claimant is not bound by that action in view of the substantial change it made
in his working conditions. We, therefore, find that the claimant's employment
ended under non-disqualifying conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

charging him with a recoverable overpayment of $450; and holding that his

is the effect of the corrected notice of determination issued by the local
office on December 13, 1976<i>.&nbsp;</i>We do not agree with the contention of
the Industrial Commissioner that such correction did not extend the time within
which the claimant could protest the corrected initial determination and
request a hearing. The Court has ruled that where a local office issued a
notice containing a correction of claimant's social security number, the
claimant's protest of the initial determination contained therein, within 30
days of the corrected notice, was timely&nbsp;<u>(Matter of Hirsch,</u>&nbsp;24

(1965) the Board has considered cases in which&nbsp;<u>corrected</u>&nbsp;determinations
have been issued by the local office and has ruled that protest of such
corrections is timely if made within 30 days thereafter (Appeal Board #
230,183A; 224,257; 202,094). Accordingly, we conclude that claimant's protest
of the initial determinations here in issue was timely with respect to the
corrected notice dated December 13, 1976 and that the referee had jurisdiction
to consider the merits of the initial determinations holding claimant
ineligible to receive benefits effective April 18, 1976, because he was not
totally unemployed and imposing the revised forfeit penalty for claimant's
wilful misrepresentations made to obtain benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that in response to an inquiry by the local office as to why claimant did not
report to the unemployment service on March 18, 1976, among other things,
claimant stated that he had found a job at a pizza store and started to work
there on April 20, 1976. That employer reported that claimant had started to
work on April 18 and continued to work, to May 16, 1976. Claimant's own
statement, made prior to the issuance of these initial determinations is more
credible than his testimony that he did not work at the pizza establishment. In
view thereof we conclude that claimant was not totally unemployed during said
period, and his weekly certifications that he had done no work during said
period constitute wilful false statements made to obtain benefits, requiring
him to forfeit 20 effective days of his future benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worker from April 30, 1973 to April 3,1975. During this period of employment,
she was absent on numerous occasions and was warned regarding her absences. She
was rehired on March 8, 1976 because she was a good worker but she was again
absent on a number of occasions. She was absent on February 7, 1977 because of
car trouble and called in her absence. Subsequently, she was ill on February
8,9 and 10 and called in her absence on February 10. On February 11, a telegram
was sent to her by the employer which stated: &quot;Due to a reduced work
schedule we find it necessary to terminate effective Friday 2/11/77.&quot;

result of a reduction in the work schedule. Claimant was chosen as one of those
to be let go because of her poor attendance record. She was not discharged
because of any particular incident or as a result of her last absence. While it
is the prerogative of the employer to discharge an employee for any reason
deemed appropriate, this cannot deprive a claimant of benefits by the expedient
of labeling the discharge as being for misconduct, when the actual reason for
the discharge was a layoff of workers due to a reduction of the work force.

     conducted under union-management sponsorship, arranged because the
     occupation is threatened with obsolescence, or because refresher training
     is needed due to new technological developments. Thus, it held that there
     was a quit with good cause when a seaman secured a leave of absence to

careers. The Fund is voluntary and open to all full-time and regular part-time
employees. The employee contributes five percent of his salary, up to $750 per

decision on the question of sick leave and weeks of employment. Subdivision
2(a) of Section 517 of the Unemployment Insurance Law excludes from the
definition of remuneration any payment made under a plan or system established
by an employer for his employees on account of sickness or disability.
Heretofore a claimant on paid sick leave was credited with weeks of employment
but no remuneration. The effect of the instant decision is that generally a
claimant who was on paid sick leave cannot be credited with either weeks of
employment or remuneration. An exception would apply when the payments are made
not under a plan for employees generally but specifically for the individual
concerned. In such case the payments are in the nature of wages and claimant
may receive credit for both weeks of employment and remuneration, far up to six
months following the last month in which the employee worked. (Subdivision 2(d)
of Section 517).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which a claimant did some work in employment. The Industrial Commissioner's
Regulation 2(g) expands that definition to include any week during any part of
which an employee is on paid vacation or other paid leave of absence even
though no actual work is performed. In such case a claimant would receive
credit for both weeks of employment and remuneration. By the instant decision
the Appeal Board has in effect removed sickness and disability leaves for
employees generally, from the definition of &quot;paid leave of absence&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Law to work for an employer without assurance of compensation. We have
previously held that this is so even though only one day is involved (Appeal
Board #78,742, 76,137). The classes were clearly given for the employer's
benefit. They were not a part of the contract of hire when claimant was
appointed junior underwriter. She was not required under the Law to accede to
the employer's request nor to continue as an underwriter. Claimant's refusal,
therefore, was not misconduct. Accordingly, we conclude that claimant was

aides by a nursing home in Canton, New York. They live in Lisbon, New York, a
distance of approximately 19 miles from their place of employment. They worked
on the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift. They traveled to work with a co-employee
who also lived in Canton. On approximately March 15, 1977, the co-worker, with
whom they traveled to work, resigned. There is no public transportation
available between these communities and neither claimant had a car available for
her use. Both claimants resigned due to this lack of transportation. They last
worked for the employer on March 7, 1977 and March 15, 1977 respectively.
Neither claimant, in her written resignation, cited a reason for her
resignation or attempted to speak to any person in authority regarding the
transportation difficulty. There were other employees who worked on different
shifts who lived in or near the area of their residence. The claimants did not
attempt to have their shifts changed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which they might reasonably have done. Had they done so, the employer might
have accommodated them and, therefore, transportation would have been available
for the new shift. Their belief that no work would be available on a different
shift was purely conjectural. By their precipitous resignation without
utilizing the extant channels, they failed to act prudently and protect their
employment and so voluntarily left their employment without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

objected to the normal tax deductions from his pay, was a personal and
non-compelling reason and without good cause. Since he worked from August 16

false certification merits a penalty of eight effective days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>However, there is no
basis for the imposition of the 12 day penalty imposed because claimant did not
disclose the identity of his last employer and that he had quit his job. The
record establishes that no inquiry was made to claimant as to whether or not he
had any employment after he filed his original claim on August 9, 1976.
Benefits were paid to him continuously and with no interruption in his claim.
Thus, the concealment of the identify of his last employer and that he had quit
the job cannot serve as the basis for a penalty for making a wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits. Our attention is directed to several
prior cases, where the Board appears to have held to the contrary. In each of those
cases (A.B. 82,749 and 147,904), there is no explanation or discussion to
indicate how such conclusion was reached. The certification in the pay order
that claimant did not work in the week for which he claimed benefits permits of
only one penalty. The Industrial Commissioner, in the case now before us,
imposed a 16 day penalty for those false certifications. For the deception in
this case he could have imposed a penalty of up to 80 days, had he so desired
(See Standards for Imposition of forfeit Days A710-21 Revised). He did not do
so. We shall no longer follow any prior decisions to the contrary on this
issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

out between the union and the employer. Through negotiation, it was agreed that

as his earnings from other employment. The regular rate of pay for each
employee was established for the period in question and from it was subtracted
either $2,750 or a larger amount of earnings, if so reported by him. Pursuant

it is clear that the addressee was no longer a claimant when notice of the
initial determinations was mailed to his last known address from which he had
long since moved; that he did not receive said notice of determinations; and
that he did not become aware of the issuance of the initial determinations
until after the expiration of the statutory period applicable to a request for
a hearing by a claimant or by a party affected thereby. Under these
circumstances, we can conceive of no valid basis upon which to hold that the addressees
herein did not make timely requests for a hearing. Since his claim for benefits
had long since terminated, it cannot be argued that the addressee in each of
these cases was under any obligation to keep the local office or the Industrial
Commissioner informed of his whereabouts, notwithstanding that an individual
then claiming benefits may have such an obligation. Accordingly, we hold that,
when a notice of initial determination is mailed to a person who is not then a
claimant, at his last known address, where he no longer resides, and he does
not receive the said notice, there is no &quot;mailing&quot; within the meaning
of Section 620.1 of the Law and the 30 day statute of limitations provided
therein may not be invoked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in each of these cases a request for hearing was made promptly after the

on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Industrial
Commissioner argues that the amount paid to each of these persons represented
compensation for the loss of&nbsp;<u>full earnings</u>&nbsp;and that since
their union agreed to the amount of $2,750 as the minimum reportable by each as
his earnings from other employment during the period of the strike, such amount
must be deemed a reasonable appraisal of such earnings. We do not agree. It is
significant that F.J.C., who was unemployed from the inception of the strike
until recalled in May 1970, received precisely the same amount as another
employee, A.S., who had earnings of $l,447 from two other jobs which he had
during the strike (see A.B. 206,294). The award to each or these men is similar
to that in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Minnie Cohen</u>&nbsp;(44 AD 2d 286, aff'g A.B.
178,824) where the award, which was calculated by deducting other income from
the amount of pay claimant would have earned on her job, was held to be damages
for her wrongful discharge. Accordingly, we conclude that the award to each of
these men did not constitute a retroactive payment of remuneration so as to
render them ineligible because of lack of total unemployment during the periods
involved. Claimants F.J.C. and Francisco C. were totally unemployed during the periods
in issue, and they were not overpaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

aide for two years until August 26, 1977. She resided with her husband, a
member of the Armed Forces, on an Air Force Base in Watertown. Claimant's
husband was given two months notice that he was being transferred to Korea.
Consequently, claimant gave up her living quarters on the base in return for
which she was given a living allotment of $200 a month. Claimant's net salary
was approximately $336 per month. Claimant made a few efforts to secure a place
to live but decided to leave her employment and move in with her family in

claimant left her employment for personal and non-compelling reasons, namely to
move in with her family following her husband's transfer to Korea. We reject
her contention that it was too expensive for her to continue to live in
Watertown. She was given an extra $200 a month living allowance following her
husband's transfer and her net salary of approximately $336 a month would have
continued. Moreover, she made only a few efforts to secure an apartment before
she decided to move back to her family. Accordingly, we conclude that she
voluntarily left her employment without good cause. Since claimant last worked
on August 26, 1977, she is disqualified from receiving benefits effective
August 27, 1977.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an Employment Security Clerk at a local unemployment insurance office. Due to a
reduction in the work force claimant was informed in May, 1976 that she was to
be laid off and such was to occur at the end of the first pay period in June.
Prior to her being laid off, claimant was told to report to an investigator at
the main office. While there, claimant was questioned concerning allegations
that she wrongly certified her sister to benefits and had falsified daily
attendance records. Claimant denied these allegations generally and expressed a
desire to be represented by an attorney. Upon the advice of her attorney she
refused to answer specific questions related to these charges. Claimant was
thereafter terminated on the ground that her refusal to answer the questions of
the investigator constituted misconduct. Concededly, there was no affirmative
evidence to indicate the claimant was guilty of any wrongdoing. The board
disqualified her from receiving benefits concluding that her refusal to answer
the questions amounted to misconduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

manifestly be criminal in nature. On advice of counsel claimant elected to
avail herself of the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the United States
Constitution and section 6 of article 1 of the New York State Constitution. It
is axiomatic that a person may assert this privilege in any situation where the
testimony may ultimately be used in a criminal proceeding against him&nbsp;<u>(Matter
of Gault,</u>&nbsp;387 U.S. 1, 47-48). The issue narrows to whether the State may
deny claimant unemployment benefits because she exercised her rights under the

Local Office 512 which services the area in which he resides. It is within
walking distance of his home. As a method of fraud control, local office
employees are not allowed to service claimants that are known to them. Because
claimant had worked in Local Office 512 for almost three months during his base
period and was known to many of the local office staff, his claim, was
transferred to Local Office 520 in the Bronx which is the next nearest local
office to claimant's home. Reporting to Local Office 520 requires claimant to

where a former local office employee has become a claimant for benefits and has
filed his claim at his former place of employment. Since claimant had recently
been employed at that office, and was known by its staff, the direction that
claimant report to Local Office 520, the next office nearest his residence, was
a reasonable method of resolving the problem. Local Office 520 is not located
at an unreasonable distance from claimant's home, nor is the travel time
required to get there excessive. We find that, under the circumstances, the

a welder with a firm that had engaged him for over eight years, claimant
resigned the concurrent part-time job that he had held with another for some
six weeks as a service station attendant and filed for unemployment insurance
benefits. The loss of his primary source of income occurred under non-disqualifying
conditions and, even though continuing work was available at the service
station on the same terms and conditions, it: was initially determined that
claimant had good cause to quit such part-time employment since his weekly
benefit rate of $95 was significantly higher than the wages of approximately
$50 per week he received from the secondary position. The service station
employer contested this determination, together with a later employer (see
Labor Law,§ 581, subd. 1, par. [e]), but both challenges were rejected
following separate hearings before the same Referee. His findings and opinions
were adopted by the board and these appeals from its respective decisions
ensued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In our opinion the
decision must be reversed. During the brief interval between his layoff and
resignation, claimant had been advised by respondent's representative that
unemployment insurance benefits could not be utilized to subsidize his loss of
earning capacity while he continued to work for appellant. The sole reason
claimant then left his part-time employment, as the board found and he
concedes, was a desire to qualify for benefits. The error of the board was in
its legal conclusion equating good cause for refusing employment (see Labor
Law, §593), with good cause for leaving work to obtaining such benefits in the
first place. Unemployment insurance benefits are payable only to those who are
&quot;totally unemployed&quot; (Labor Law, §591, subd. 1) and even those who
are arguably employed in only a technical sense are ineligible to receive them.
(See e.g.,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Todino [Ross</u>], 59 A D 2d 638;&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Brandau [Levine</u>] 52 AD 2d 696; cf.&nbsp;<u>Matter of Swyer
[Levine]&nbsp;</u>52 A D 2d 707). Although it does seem harsh to refuse to
extend benefits to an employee who happens to engage in additional outside
employment while granting them to a less industrious coworker whose single
position comes to an end at the same time, unemployment insurance is not a
minimum wage substitute and one may not voluntarily leave employment to secure
its advantages&nbsp;<u>Matter of Dillon [Career Children's Servs. -Ross</u>],
59 A D 2d 592,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Jolly [Levine]</u>, 52 A D 2d 706). Any change
in the meaning of total unemployment must be accomplished by legislative means,
and we are constrained to conclude, as a matter of law, that claimant's
voluntary resignation from appellant's employ was without good cause. Since
this result may well have a favorable impact on appellant's experience rating
charges. (see Labor Law, §581, 3 subd. 6), we find it unnecessary to pass upon
the specific arguments addressed to that determination at this time and remit
both decisions to the board for further consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

school for approximately ten years. In January, 1977, she was informed by the
headmaster that her services would not be required for the 1978-1979 school
year. He also informed claimant. that since she had ten years of employment she
was entitled to a one year of sabbatical leave, at half pay. On February 28,
1977, claimant entered into a contract of employment which covered the period
from September 1, 1977 through August 31, 1978. Since she elected to take this
year on sabbatical leave, she was entitled to receive one half of her usual
pay, in monthly installments or full pay for the first six months of her leave.
She chose the latter option. Claimant continued to be covered under the
employer's medical insurance plan and to accrue pension credits throughout her
leave. After receiving her final pay, claimant filed an original claim for
benefits effective March 20, 1978, and indicated thereon that she was not
working because she was &quot;Fired, no reason given.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

received only half of the agreed pay for the year does not negate the fact that
claimant was hired under an annual contract. Accordingly, we conclude that
claimant was not totally unemployed during the period in issue. Claimant was
aware of the facts. Hence her statement an her original claim that she was no
longer employed because she was &quot;Fired, no reason given,&quot; was
wilfully false and was made to obtain benefits. Accordingly, claimant is

Office had previously received responses from the employer to inquiries
involving this case. The employer's protests, in those responses, against any
charges to its account did not constitute a request for a bearing based on the
notice of November 18, 1977 because they were made prior to the issuance of the
notice. Objections made prior to the issuance of the initial determination
cannot be deemed a timely request for a hearing. The request must be made
subsequent to issuance (Appeal Board 241,626A). Therefore, we conclude that the

an adjunct lecturer by a college of a city university. Each year since then, he
was re-appointed even though such re-employment had not been guaranteed because
of uncertainties in budget, registration and curriculum. He has the most
seniority of the adjunct lecturers in his department. By May 1978, the college
administration was preparing its proposed budget for the 1978-79 academic year.
This budget included money for adjunct lecturers. On May 4, 1978, the Dean of
Faculty of the college sent a notice to the claimant that he would be
re-appointed as an adjunct member of the instructional staff for the fall of
1978. This reappointment was subject to the sufficiency of registration,
changes in curriculum, and the financial ability of the college. The practice
of the college is to assign its adjunct faculty to particular courses only
after the students have registered for the fall courses. The registration is at
the end of the summer and in early September. As requested on the notice, the
claimant signed the notice of May 4, 1978 in the space provided thereon, below
the words, &quot;I hereby accept the adjunct re-appointment tendered above.&quot;
The claimant then returned the notice to the college.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The claimant has worked
in an instructional capacity for the college during the 1977-78 school year. On
May 4, 1978, he was notified by the employer that he would be re-appointed for
the fall of 1978. This creates a reasonable assurance of employment in an
instructional capacity, as provided by Section 590.10 of the Labor Law.
Notwithstanding the fact that there was no guarantee of re-employment because
of factors such as budget, enrollment and registration, nevertheless,
considering all of the facts including the claimant’s work history or
re-employment since 1972, we conclude that he has a reasonable assurance of
employment. The assurance is determined by the actions of the employer and
continues until the actions of the employer establish the contrary. There is no
indication that the employer was acting in other than good faith when it
offered the claimant a reasonable assurance of re-employment. Since the
claimant has a reasonable assurance of employment in an instruction capacity
with an educational institution, his weeks of employment and remuneration with
the educational institution are to be disregarded as provided in Section
590.10. Accordingly, we conclude that the claimant is ineligible to receive
benefits during the summer recess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Effective January 6, 1978 the claimant was tenured in her position. On June 7,
1978, the employer notified the claimant that it was continuing her services
for the 1978-79 school year. The notice instructed the claimant to return to

would be continued by the school district. We conclude that this constitutes a
reasonable assurance of employment. Accordingly since the claimant has a
reasonable assurance of employment in an instructional capacity with an
educational institution, her weeks of employment and remuneration with the
educational institution are to be disregarded, as provided in Section 590.10 of
the Labor Law. However, the claimant’s work history indicates that, for this
claimant, the school year normally continues through the latter part of June.
Prior to June 23, 1978 when the school’s 1977-78 school year ended, although
the claimant was not working due to budget restrictions, she was not between
academic years or terms as provided in the statute. Accordingly, we conclude that
the claimant is eligible to receive benefits through June 23, 1978. Thereafter,
since she is between academic years or terms and has a reasonable assurance of
employment in the next academic year, she is ineligible to receive benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contemplate the ability to read, write and do simple arithmetic. Since, at the
time claimant filed for 599 approval he had only two months remaining in his
program to receive his high school equivalency certificate we officially notice
that he had previously acquired the &quot;basic education skills&quot; as
contemplated in the statute. Accordingly, we conclude that claimant’s course of

efforts reported by claimant as made on several different days, were made at
locations in such close proximity with one another that they could have been
made at the same time. Under the circumstances we hold that claimant’s efforts
were meager, random and sporadic and do not evince a true attachment to the
labor market. Accordingly, we conclude that he was not available for

fact that, as a school principal, her employment was administrative and that,
as a teacher, it would be instructional is immaterial. Both administrative and
instructional work are in the category of professional employment within the
meaning of Section 590.10 of the Law. Since the claimant was offered work as a
teacher in the next school year, we conclude that she has a reasonable
assurance of employment in an instructional capacity, as provided under Section

effective July 10, 1978, establishing a base period beginning July 11, 1977 and
ending July 9, 1978. During this base period claimant worked as a substitute teacher
for S. &amp; U. school districts on six occasions; he also taught full-time
from July through August 1977, October through November 1977, and from January
to June 23, 1978. In June 1978, S. school district sent claimant a notice
requesting that he indicate by June 23, 1978 if he was interested in substitute
teaching during the 1978-79 school year. Claimant responded that he was not. On
or about July 5, 1978 U. school district notified claimant that he would be
retained on its active substitute list. Claimant responded by stating that he
would not be available for the 1978 fall semester. Claimant did not want to
substitute teach as he preferred full-time employment. Claimant testified at
the hearing of September 11, 1978 that, as he had not yet found full-time work,
he had asked S. school district to place him on their substitute list. His
request was granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the 1977-78 school year, claimant worked as a substitute teacher for two school
districts; he also taught full-time during this period, through June 23, 1978.
In June and July, S. and U. school districts, respectively, notified claimant
that substitute work was available for the 1978-79 school year. U. school
district specifically indicated that claimant was to be retained on its list of
active substitute teachers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>This is sufficient to
create a reasonable assurance, as provided in Section 590.10 of the Labor Law.
Neither the specific number of days on which claimant might be called to teach,
nor his willingness to do so is controlling. Reasonable assurance depends upon
the availability of the position to claimant. It is immaterial that claimant
responded in the negative to the notices sent to him by S. and U. school
districts because he preferred full-time employment. A claimant should not be
able to control his entitlement to benefits by having his name removed from the
active substitute list for the summer and then by having it restored in the
fall, when he could not obtain full-time employment, as a means of establishing
that he is available for work. It is likewise immaterial that claimant taught
in a full-time capacity for the greater part of 1977-78. It was work in an
instructional capacity and he has a reasonable assurance of employment in an instructional
capacity for the 1978-79 school year. Accordingly, we conclude that claimant’s
weeks of employment in an instructional capacity and his remuneration therefrom
with each of his base period educational institutional employers are to be
disregarded, as provided in Section 590.10 of the Law. The claimant is
ineligible to receive benefits during the summer recess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which is an ongoing determination and is reviewable 30 days prior to the date

determination under Section 590.11 of the Law is a ruling as to entitlement as
of the effective date of the claim. The record establishes that each claimant
failed to make a timely request for a hearing. There is no basis on which the

employment would continue for the 1978-79 school year. On July 28, 1978, the
claimant received a letter from another university offering him employment as a
counselor for the academic year from September 1, 1978 through June 30, 1978.
He accepted this offer on August 2, 1978 and commenced work on September 1,
1978. Claimant filed an original claim for benefits effective June 12, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

From September 10 through October 1, 1973, there was a labor dispute between

worked on September 7, 1973. He filed an original claim for benefits on
November 8, 1973. He was credited with 44 weeks of employment and earnings of

practice and ordered the employer to make whole the claimant and others

reflected the amount of gross back pay, less interim earnings by the claimant.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered a consent
judgment enforcing the back pay provisions of the Board order. Thereafter, the
employer objected to the amount of the back pay, including the amount due to
the claimant. This objection was settled between the NLRB and the employer.
Pursuant to the settlement, the claimant received a gross award of $3,288 in

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The issue before the
Board involves the method to be used in allocating back pay award to the weeks
of the claimant’s unemployment. The local office found that the claimant had
received a back pay award for the period of his unemployment and was therefore
not totally unemployed throughout the period. The administrative law judge
determined that the back pay which claimant actually received was three
quarters of his full back pay. He therefore, modified the initial determination
to be effective three days in each week. In the first statement submitted to
this Board on behalf of the Industrial Commissioner, it was contended that the
back pay was for a period of 39 weeks, three calendar quarters. The amount of
back pay was therefore an average of over $83 a week. Since this exceeded the
maximum benefit rate of $75 then payable to any claimant, the Industrial
Commissioner contended that Section 523 of the Labor Law applied and that no
effective days were deemed to occur in any of the weeks. We conclude that each
of these methods is incorrect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Based on the number of
weeks and the amount of remuneration with which the claimant was credited when
he filed his original claim for benefits, his average weekly wage was $160. The
Board has previously held that the back pay award is to be divided by the
average weekly wage. This will establish the number of weeks for which the
claimant received back pay (Appeal Board 31,113 and 32,310; see also&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Steward</u>, 279 App. Div. 500, aff’g Appeal Board 26,76). Accordingly, we
conclude that the claimant received back pay for 23 weeks. Since the period of
the award begins on October 1, 1973, we conclude that he received back pay for
each week beginning with the statutory week ending October 7, 1973 through the
statutory week ending February 17, 1974. This is true even though the claimant
did not file his original claim for benefits until November 8, 1973.
Accordingly, the claimant was not eligible to receive benefits through February
17, 1974. He was overpaid benefits of $1,012.50 through that date. These
benefits were recoverable, pursuant to Section 597.4 of the Labor Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employed for over 25 years by a firm specializing in the preparation and
delivery of cement, mixed in transit, to various construction companies for use
at contraction sites. He is a member of long standing of the union which is in
contractual relations with the employers in that industry. He worked on
shape-up basis, governed by the seniority of workers for the particular
employer for which they usually worked. He was the third man in seniority on
the overall list of the employer’s work staff, but was fourth man in seniority
at the particular location where he usually worked. The first place on the
seniority list was held by the union shop steward at that site, regardless of
that individual’s actual seniority. Because of his seniority, the claimant was
invariably assigned to work on all days that he shaped-up for work at the site.
In the year prior to July 2, 1978, he had been unable to work on only about 25
to 30 days, and then because there was no work at all, usually because of
adverse weather conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer at the site where the claimant usually shaped-up. Though no pickets
appeared at the work site, the engineers and teamsters did not report for work
and, without them, no work could be performed by others. The claimant’s union
had a contract with the employer’s association, which had been signed on June
1, 1978, and there was no controversy between it and the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reported that June 30, 1978 was his last day of work for the employer and that
he had been laid off for lack of work. He also reported on the claim form that
there was no labor dispute in any place where he had worked in the prior eight

based upon the &quot;shape-up&quot; employment method utilized in 1948 affirmed

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The 1948 shape-up method
referred to by the Court in&nbsp;<u>Lessner</u>, supra, was one where the
longshoremen were selected for work assignments by the pier hiring boss, solely
on a personal choice basis. There was no element of seniority influencing his
choice and he would choose workers solely on whomever he wanted to give work to
and whomever he wanted to refuse to allow to work. Significantly, sufficient
elements of this free hiring choice were found to exist in&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Crerand</u>, (46 A.D. 2d 822), again involving longshoremen, so that the Court
could again apply the&nbsp;<u>Burger</u>&nbsp;rule, despite having previously
qualified that rule in&nbsp;<u>Lessner</u>. The only difference in&nbsp;<u>Crerand</u>&nbsp;was
that, in the intervening years, the states of New York and New Jersey had
established the Bi-State Waterfront Commission to eliminate certain unsavory
characters and their influence from the operations of the Port of New York by
creating longshoremen’s hiring halls, under control of the Commission, wherein
the hiring for long shore work was done. There still was no element of
seniority involved other than that one man’s right to be hired before another
depended solely on the time that he appeared at the hall and deposited his
Commission issued badge with the shape-up clerk to indicate he was seeking
employment; the men being called in such order when a call came in from any
pier in the hall’s assigned area for a work crew. Such &quot;daily&quot; seniority
ended with the work assignment and did not carry over to the next shape-up;
that, once again being on the basis of &quot;first badge in, first one called
and hired.&quot; In&nbsp;<u>Lessner</u>, in contrast to these methods of
hiring, it was found that the shape-up had the added element that, as in the
case under review herein, a man who had worked on the particular pier, for the
shipper operating from that pier, for a longer time than another man was
entitled to be given work ahead of that other man, even though he might have
come to the shape-up much later than the man deemed his junior in seniority.
This is the seniority element which distinguishes the&nbsp;<u>Lessner</u>&nbsp;rule
from the rule of&nbsp;<u>Burger</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Crerand</u>. And this is
the seniority rule which is involved herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

establish that this claimant is subject to the &quot;<u>Lessner</u>&quot; rule
and that the judge erred in applying the &quot;<u>Burger</u>&quot; rule. His
work history with the employer was third highest of all the employer’s work
staff. When he shaped-up, he was assured of work, if there was any to be had.
His work history and seniority were such that he must be considered as having
been in regular employment. Therefore, since his unemployment resulted from the
industrial controversy which admittedly existed in the establishment where he
was employed, he was subject to the suspension of his benefit rights. He was
overpaid $575 in benefits which are recoverable because he made a false
statement in his claim that there was no strike or labor dispute in the
establishment where he had worked in the last eight weeks. That statement was
wilfully false for which the forfeit penalty is eight days of future benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Appeal Board cited several court cases, all dealing with waterfront hiring
systems and their effect on the industrial controversy suspension. In&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Burger</u>, (303 NY 654; A-750-1062), longshoremen were selected for work
assignments by employers solely on a personal choice basis. There was no
seniority element influencing the employer’s choice and he could select those
for whom he wanted to provide work and reject whomever he would not allow to
work. Based upon this method of hiring, the Court held there was no regular
employment relationship between the longshoremen and the employer. Similarly,
elements of this freelance hiring were found to exist in&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Crerand</u>&nbsp;(46 AD 2d 822; A-750-1785), a case dealing with longshoremen
who obtain employment by shaping-up at a central hiring hall, rather than at
the employer establishment. The rule in&nbsp;<u>Burger</u>&nbsp;was applied
to&nbsp;<u>Crerand</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of longshoremen hiring practices, one similar to that in&nbsp;<u>Burger</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Crerand</u>,
and the other a &quot;gang&quot; system whereby members of a &quot;regular
gang&quot; were the first to be called to work by the employer.
&quot;Gang&quot; hiring was done by pre-ordering or by being placed on a list
maintained by the employer. The regularity and frequency of work provided
demonstrated a regular course of employment between &quot;gang&quot; members
and the employer and an interruption caused by an industrial controversy
warranted a suspension of benefits. By limiting the rule in&nbsp;<u>Burger</u>,
the court in&nbsp;<u>Lessner</u>&nbsp;has delineated an employer/employee
relationship where there is preferential and priority hiring of longshoremen
listed on labor rosters or who have worked regularly on piers in a particular

claims examiner told claimant that it would be permissible for him to report
earlier on that day. While on the way to his home in New Jersey, claimant
altered the ink entry of 2 to 2:30 on his book,&nbsp;<u>in pencil,</u>&nbsp;to
read 10 to 10:30. He did this because he estimated that the commuter train
would enable him to reach the insurance office by this hour. When he reported
to the insurance office on June 6, 1979 and presented his book and the calendar
insert to claim benefits for the proceeding weeks, the alteration was observed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Morgan&nbsp;</u>(30 AD 2d 595, aff'g A.B. 140, 448). Morgan reported to the
employment service on April 17, 1967 and was instructed to report on April 19
to another office which handled sales jobs. An entry to that effect was made in
his calendar insert. Morgan did not report on April 19, as instructed, and
struck out the entry of April 19 that had been made in his calendar insert. The
unauthorized alteration was discovered when he next reported to the insurance
office to claim benefits and presented his book. The Board ruled that any
unauthorized alteration of an official entry in a claimant's booklet
constitutes a wilful misrepresentation to obtain benefits. On appeal, the
decision of the Board was affirmed. In a memorandum opinion, the Court stated
that unauthorized alterations of an official entry in the claimant's insurance
booklet is sufficient to constitute a wilful misrepresentation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We have consistently
held that in the&nbsp;<u>Morgan&nbsp;</u>type of case, an alteration, being
unauthorized, constitutes a wilful misrepresentation when the claimant presents
his book or calendar insert in order to obtain benefits. However, situations
have occurred where the claimant has been instructed by the insurance office or
by the employment service to report on a different day or at a different hour
than that entered in claimant's booklet and claimant alters the entry to remind
himself of the instruction to report on a different date or time. While the
claimant has not been instructed to alter the official entry, he has been
instructed to report at a new time or on a different day and has complied with
such instruction. In such a case, the alteration of the official entry<i>&nbsp;</i>has
been held not to constitute a wilful misrepresentation because there was no
intent to defraud and the alteration was in conformance with the instruction by
the agency to report at a different time or on a different day. (See A.B.
246,488F).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

circumstances herein require the conclusion that the pencil alteration of the
ink entry made by the claimant was not a wilful misrepresentation because it
was not intended to deceive and because claimant had been instructed by the
claims examiner that he could report on June 6, 1979 at an hour earlier than
that assigned. The mere writing by claimant on his book is not a wilful
misrepresentation. (Appeal Board 280,509A). The presentment of a book altered
with intent to deceive and thus obtain benefits constitutes a wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits. Even though claimant was not instructed
to alter the official entry, his pencil alteration was not such an unauthorized
alteration of an official entry as was involved in&nbsp;<u>Morgan.</u>&nbsp;Accordingly,
we conclude that claimant did not make a wilful misrepresentation to obtain

Appeal Board have consistently held that an unauthorized alteration constitutes
a wilful misrepresentation, provided the presentation of the book or calendar
insert is done with intent to deceive and thus obtain benefits.&nbsp;<u>(Matter
of Morgan</u>, 30 AD 2d 595, aft. A.B. 140,448; not reported) (A.B. 64,161-58;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>2. In the present case,
although claimant, was not expressly instructed to alter the official entry, he
had been authorized to report at a new time and complied with such instruction.
There was no intent to defraud and the alteration was made to conform with
official instructions to report at a different time. The Appeal Board's holding
is that an express authorization to report at a different time or day is also
an implied authorization to make a conforming change to the book's entry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>3. In another case when
claimant altered the insurance booklet to conform to a change of date given by
employment service personnel, the Appeal Board held that because there was no
intent to defraud either the insurance office or the employment office, the
forfeit penalty for a wilful misrepresentation was not to be imposed. (A.B.
246, 488F, not reported) (Similarly A.B. 295,677; not reported).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rule should be limited to cases where it can be established that claimant's
actions resulted from instructions given by authorized personnel of the
Department of Labor, and there if no evidence of intent by claimant to defraud
to obtain benefits. The Appeal Board has held that &quot;The mere writing by
claimant on his book is not a wil1u1 misrepresentation if not made to obtain
benefits.&quot; (A.B. 280, 5O9A; not reported).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

appellant for approximately 10 weeks until February 26, 1978. When claimant's
car, which he used to travel to his employment, became inoperable, he requested
appellant's assistance in providing alternative transportation and discharged
claimant because he could not come to work. It was noted that had claimant used
public transportation he would have been required to travel in excess of two

     does not result in a change in the terms and conditions of the employment.

automobile or have the one she already owned repaired. However, because she
still owed money on a previous loan, she was not able to obtain any further
funds. Claimant called her employer, explained the situation and asked for a
leave of absence until she could obtain other transportation. However, claimant
was discharged because the employer felt it could not wait for an indefinite
time until claimant could obtain other transportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;At the outset it should be noted that
claimant did not voluntarily leave her employment. Both claimant and the
employer agree that she was discharged after she asked for a leave of absence
in order to obtain other transportation. The employer and the Industrial
Commissioner both contend that, by failing to repair her car, claimant did not
live up to the terms and conditions of her employment and thereby voluntarily
left her employment. We cannot accept this contention. The evidence establishes
that claimant made every effort to repair her automobile or obtain funds to
purchase another automobile, but was unable to do so. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Thunelius</u>, (18 AD 2d 948), the court ruled that financial difficulties
which were not the fault of the claimant and which prevented claimant from
meeting a condition of his employment did not constitute a voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause.&nbsp;<u>Matter of Kudysch</u>&nbsp;(72 AD 2d
901)is distinguishable. In&nbsp;<u>Kudysch,</u>&nbsp;the court made the
specific finding that claimant could have gotten to work by public transportation,
although it would have taken over two hours. The court held that, under such
circumstances, claimant was not justified in leaving his job. No such
alternative was available for the claimant in this case. Accordingly, we
conclude that claimant's employment did not end under disqualifying conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     intention to leave employment at a future date is not an act of
     misconduct... His resignation at a future date, which had not as yet
     occurred and which had played no part in his separation, cannot be

     conditions.&quot; (A.B. 201,614A not reported).<o:p></o:p></span></li>

      "Times New Roman"'>A truck driver, having been denied a salary increase,
      slowed down in his work and refused to work any more overtime. On June
      12, 1974 at 4 p.m., he refused to make an additional delivery because it
      would have required one hour overtime (for which he would have been
      compensated). Told that he would be replaced if he didn't follow orders,
      he replied that he would leave the job in three weeks. He was discharged
      immediately. The Appeal Board held that claimant's refusal to comply with
      the reasonable request, to make an additional delivery, coupled with his
      giving notice that he would leave the job in three weeks, after being
      warned that he would be replaced if he did not follow orders, constituted
      insubordinate behavior. It imposed a disqualification for misconduct,
      effective June 13, 1974 (A.B. 199,753; reported). Thus, where the facts
      indicate that a claimant's discharge is precipitated by actions
      detrimental to the employer, a disqualification for misconduct is proper.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

1979, until 1980, as a barmaid by a corporation which operated a roadside
tavern in a ski-resort area. She was assigned to the &quot;down-stairs&quot;
bar, to work six nights a week, with hours of 3:00 P.M. to 11:00 p.m. She was
never given a fixed period for her evening meal, but was allowed to have food
sent to her at the bar, from the kitchen, whenever she felt she had time to eat
when the bar trade was slow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

corporation is a person who sometimes expresses himself with profanity.
Claimant was occasionally addressed by him in that manner, even on the most
ordinary of matters and without provocation on her part. She complained to him
about his use of profanity in her presence and advised him that if it did not
stop, she would resign. On the day before her last day of work, claimant was
unable to report to work on time because her automobile had been snowed in by a
major snowstorm and had to be dug out. When she reported her inability to get
to work on time, she was again spoken to with profanity. This occurred again on
the following day and caused her to resign from the employment on that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The credible evidence, now before the
Board, establishes a course of conduct on the part of the employer that was
both objectionable and violative of the provisions of the Labor Law. We find
that the employer was in substantial violation of Labor Law, Section 162,
relating to hours allowed to employees for meals. Subdivision 4 of that section
specifically applies to the claimant herein. It reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

hours of one o'clock in the afternoon and six o'clock in the morning, shall be
allowed--forty-five minutes for meals period when employed in or in connection

provisions of this Chapter, at a time midway between the beginning and end of
such employment.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We considered the application
of Labor Law, Section 162, to a situation similar to the one herein, in Appeal
Board 214,157; 214,158. In that case, the employees in a dentist's office were
required to periodically cover the office during lunch hours, by having at
least one of them eat lunch in the office, while attending to all necessary
work that arose during the lunch hour. We commented on the employer's practice
therein as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;The evidence in
the record on appeal is conclusive that the claimants were not consistently
allowed a lunch period as required by the Law. Although they were not prevented
from eating their noon meals they were required to eat while at work, whenever
they were assigned to staff the office in the absence of the other employees on
their lunch period. The Board does not consider this to be compliance with the
clear intent of the Law. The time period prescribed must be allowed to the
employee for eating or for any other use which the employee chooses to make of
it.&nbsp;<u>What the Law contemplates is not just an opportunity to consume
food, but also a respite from work.&quot;</u>&nbsp;(Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the instant case
under review, we find our prior comments equally applicable. The claimant did
not have an uninterrupted &quot;respite from work&quot; during which she could
eat her meal or do whatever else she wished. True, food was brought to her, but
she had to eat &quot;on the run&quot; while serving the employer's patrons in
the bar. This cannot be deemed to be any measure of compliance with the Law.
This arrangement was good cause for the claimant to resign from her employment.
In addition, we find that the employer's use of profane language, both
addressed to the claimant and in her presence, was inappropriate and uncalled
for under any circumstances. His continued use of such language after she had
specifically complained to him about it also gave her good cause to resign from
her employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the claimant quit because of the profanity directed to her by the employer. She
advanced no other reason for leaving. Subsequently, the employer's violation of
a provision of the New York State Labor Law (Sec. 162), dealing with working
conditions, was disclosed, and, thus, the claimant was afforded good cause. The
principle enunciated by the Appeal Board will apply equally to a claimant's
refusal of employment when an employer is in violation of labor law provisions
dealing with working conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

exercised when making determinations pursuant to the principle set forth in the

upon application to the Industrial Commissioner. An employer who has been
granted an exception is not in violation. Local office fact finding in these
situations must include information with respect to a possible exception.
Additionally, certain employees or employers may not be subject to the
provisions of the Labor Law. Fact finding here must also include such information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
