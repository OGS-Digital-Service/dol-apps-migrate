<P>Requirements for the filing of original and additional claims, reporting and certifying to unemployment at the local insurance office,  and reporting to the employment service, are contained in the Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 596, and in the Commissioner of  Labor's Regulations 40, 41, 42 and 43. </P>
<P>Although terminology in the Law and regulations varies, the filing of an original or additional claim is customarily referred to as compliance with <U>registration</U> requirements; reporting to the local insurance office (in person or by mail) to certify to a period of  unemployment, and to the employment service as directed, are customarily referred to as compliance with <U>reporting</U> requirements.  </P>
<P> Failure to comply with registration or reporting requirements may be excused by the Commissioner of Labor if good cause is shown.</P>

<OL>
<LI>The fact that a claimant makes a wilful false statement upon filing for benefits does not make the claim invalid.  (A.B. 37,745-53)  </LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Where a claimant had forged the signatures of witnesses on mail certification forms, it was held that such certifications were null and void and claimant was overpaid for the weeks involved.  (A.B. 11,351-44; <a href="05.htm#594">A-750-594</a>)  </LI>
<p></p>
<li>Obsoleted by Field Memorandum 2-2001</p>
<!-- <LI>Failure to report to the placement office on the date assigned for this purpose if coupled with an alteration of the reporting date entry on the &quot;Claimant's Record" results in ineligibility until claimant subsequently reports to such office, notwithstanding his regular reporting to the insurance office in the interim period.  (A.B. 34,588-52; <a href="11.htm#1163">A-750-1163</a>)  </LI> -->
<p></p>
<LI>Where claimant's failure to report as required is excused but he does not subsequently report in such statutory week for unjustifiable reasons, no credit is allowed for days in that week  subsequent to the excused failure to report.  (A.B. 124,639; <a href="16.htm#1644">A-750-1644</a>) </LI>
<p></p>
<li>Obsoleted by Field Memorandum 2-2001</p>
<!-- <LI>If a reporting date to the placement office had been assigned upon the filing of an original claim which was subsequently invalidated, a failure to report on such date does not result in a disqualification if it has not been reassigned upon the filing of a later valid claim.

<p></p>
<li>Obsoleted by Field Memorandum 2-2001</p>
<!-- <LI>When a claim has lapsed due to the claimant's return to work, failure to report to the placement office after filing an additional claim does not result in ineligibility if the date was assigned before the lapse and was never reassigned after the claimant reopened the claim.  (A.B. 137,703A) </LI> -->
<p></p>
<LI>Deliberate disregard of specific direction to report daily to the employment office resulted in suspension of benefit rights.  (A.B. 9384-43; <a href="04.htm#493">A-750-493</a>)  </LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Claimant's registration prior to July 1, 1939 was not postdated subsequent thereto because a change in the Law effective after July 1 might result in added advantage to claimant.  (A.B. 1243-39)  </LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Directing claimant, a former local office employee, to report to a nearby local office where he is not known to the personnel who will process his claim, is a reasonable exercise of administrative authority.  (A.B. 270,061; <a href="18.htm#1861">A-750-1861)</a> </LI>

<p></p>
<LI>Where local office records on claim registration were faulty, a claimant's uncontradicted testimony that (s)he had filed a claim for benefits was controlling.  (A.B. 600-39) </LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Where, under special arrangement, union was authorized to accept registrations, and there was no proof that claimant's filings were actually transmitted to local office which had no record of them, the responsibility was the union's and claimant was not credited with alleged filings.

<!-- <LI>Reporting at the insurance office on a day of the week which precedes his regular assigned day and in which his additional claim is not accepted does not entitle a claimant to any credit for benefits in that week when he was instructed to return on his regular day but because of negligence, failed to do so.  (<u>Matter of John Omolina</u>, 11 AD 2d 553; A.B. 67,648-58; <a href="15.htm#1520">A-750-1520</a>) </LI> -->

<!-- <LI>Reporting as prescribed by regulations and certifying to past unemployment are two separate acts.  Special hours, for instance during evenings, may be designated solely for the purpose of certification to past unemployment.  A claimant's appearance at a local office and his certification to past unemployment at such hours do not constitute compliance with reporting requirements.  However, the failure to comply with reporting requirements may be excused under appropriate circumstances.  (A.B. 43,464-54; <a href="12.htm#1287">A-750-1287</a>) </LI> -->
<p></p>
<LI>A claimant's failure to report for a PEER interview scheduled by mail is not excused, when the notice to claimant to report for the interview is properly addressed and not returned by the Post Office, because the Department's normal office procedures in processing, addressing and mailing computer generated mass mailings of Peer appointment notices is presumptive evidence that a particular claimant received mail delivery of the properly sent notice in due course.  The claimant's unsubstantiated contention that the mailed notice was not delivered is insufficient to rebut the presumption.  (A.B. 421,884; <a href="20.htm#2056">A-750-2056</a>) </LI>

<p></p>
<LI>A request to a claimant that she sign a consent to enable the  Employment Service to ascertain from her physician the nature and extent of her epileptic seizures was within the requirements for registration for work and her refusal to so sign constituted failure to comply with registration requirements because such information was reasonable and necessary to safeguard the interest of the claimant and any prospective co-workers and employer to whom she might be referred.

<p></p>
<LI>Where claimant furnishes the names and addresses of the persons with whom she made arrangements for the care of her children during working hours, her refusal to submit a written statement by such persons does not constitute a failure to comply with reporting requirements.  <U>(Matter of Haller, </U>281 App. Div. 737; <a href="11.htm#1159">A-750-1159</a>) </LI>

<LI>Where claimant was informed not to continue to report when apparently he had exhausted benefits and, thereafter, he received a back-pay award invalidating his eligibility for the period covered by the award, thereby shifting his true period of eligibility, his failure to continue to report was not excused; a reasonable standard of conduct required him to inform the office of the pending award, especially since he knew of the award at that time and also knew that it provided for the return of unemployment insurance benefits.
