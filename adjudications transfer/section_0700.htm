<p></U><P>Section 591.2 of the Unemployment Insurance Law imposes two conditions for eligibility for benefits: </P></p>
<blockquote>
<P>1. The claimant must be <U>"capable of work".</U> That is (s)he must possess the physical and mental ability to perform work; and </P>
<P>2. The claimant must be "<U>ready, willing and able to work in his usual employment or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience.</U>" One who meets this condition is considered to be "available" for work. </P>
</blockquote>
<P>The issue of capability must be resolved whenever the local office receives information that a claimant may be, or may have been, unable to work due to some physical or mental impairment. The impairment may be a temporary condition caused by a short-term illness or injury. or may result from a chronic or debilitating illness or disability. In resolving a question of capability involving long term or serious conditions, claims personnel are not only to consider the nature and extent of the impairment, but also to evaluate the claimants residual capacity for work.</P>
<P>A claimant who is capable of work must also be available for work to be eligible for benefits. That is, (s)he must be ready. willing and able to work in employment for which (s)he is reasonably fitted by training and experience. A claimant is considered to be available for work if (s)he places no unreasonable restrictions on the type or conditions of employment (s)he will accept, is making a diligent effort to obtain work. and is prepared to start work without delay upon securing employment.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the requirement of Section 591.2 that a claimant be ready, willing and able to work in a claimant may not be denied benefits due to unavailability because of such claimants service on a grand or petit jury of any state or of the United States.. (sub. sec. 591.1); nor may a claimant be held ineligible for benefits because of "regular attendance at a vocational training course. or at a course in basic education skills which the commissioner has approved (sub. sec. 599.1). or because (s)he "is in training approved under the federal trade act of nineteen hundred seventy-four...". (sub. sec. 599.2) </P>
<P>When interviewing claimants regarding the issues of availability and capability, claims personnel should consult the appropriate Fact-Finding Guidecards for a checklist of questions to be explored. Determinations should be made in accordance with the principles reported in this section of the Interpretation Service Index, the policies set forth in relevant Special Bulletins (A-710 series) and Field Memoranda. </P></FONT><center></center>

<LI>There must be a causal connection between any lack of specific advice at the local office and the claimant having removed herself from the labor market in order for the lack of advice to form a basis for claimant to be held available for employment.

<LI>Claimant’s duties as president of and financial interest in a new corporation prevented him from accepting other work and thus rendered him unavailable for employment. (A.B. 7074-42; <a href="03.htm#342">A-750-342</a>) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Where it was inferable from claimant’s substantial interest in a summer resort hotel that his remuneration was dependent to some extent on &quot;some supervisory, managerial or caretaking service throughout the part of the year the hotel is closed.&quot; and where his efforts to find employment were desultory or half-hearted, it was held that his unemployment was voluntary, that he was not genuinely in the labor market, and therefore unavailable for employment. <U>(Matter of Leshner.</U> 268 App. Div. 582; <a href="05.htm#598">A-750-598</a>) </LI><br><br>
<LI>A salaried officer who reported daily during period of negotiation to determine his stock interest in corporation was neither totally unemployed nor available for employment until negotiations were completed and he resigned his office. (A.B.770-39) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Nominal officer of corporation, not owning stock therein and performing only manual work therefor, was found totally unemployed and available during slack periods where the evidence established that during the slack periods he received no wages from the corporation and was ready, willing, and able to take other work.

<LI>Voluntary leaving of employment to devote entire time to domestic duties resulted in unavailability because of withdrawal from labor market. (A.B. 5264-41; <a href="02.htm#267">A-750-267</a>) </LI>
<br><br>
<LI>Claimant who could not accept referral because she must take care of child was not available for employment. (A.B. 3612-40; <a href="02.htm#214">A-750-214</a>) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Claimant, who filed for benefits after childbirth and alleged that her mother would care for her baby if she accepted employment, was held to be unavailable. It was found that her mother was unable to do so because of her age and physical condition and in view of the distance of her home from claimant’s residence. (AB. 21,794-49; <a href="09.htm#943">A-750-943</a>)</LI>
<br><br>
<LI>Claimant’s contention that she would take her two-month-old child in a taxicab each working morning to the home of her sister-in law who had three infants of her own was not believed and claimant was held to be unavailable for employment since she had made no practical arrangement for the care of her child. (A.B. 24,691-50; <a href="10.htm#1004">A-750-1004</a>) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Claimant was held unavailable for employment after childbirth, in spite of alleged independent efforts to seek work, when alleged arrangements for the care of her infant child appeared incredible, and when it was unreasonable to believe that claimant could not have obtained work during the extended period of her unemployment in view of the unusual demand for her occupation if she were genuinely interested in obtaining employment. (A.B. 28,762-51; <a href="10.htm#1086">A-750-1086</a>)</LI><br><br>
<LI>A foster mother of two children, licensed under the requirement that "The applicant is not to be employed outside her home,&quot; was held to be available for employment since it is the practice of the Welfare Office, when a foster mother is found to have outside employment and arrangements have been made for the care of her foster children, to continue such arrangement until the children are transferred elsewhere. In the instant case, claimant’s availability was not affected by her duties as a foster mother; claimant secured employment and her 21-year-old daughter cared for the one remaining foster child until arrangements for transfer could be made.

<LI>Homeworker whose employment was terminated because her last employer discontinued giving out homework and who made no efforts to look for homework with other employers or in other industries where homework was available. but remained unemployed for more than a year, held to be unavailable for employment.

<LI>Where inability to call on prospective employer was due to illness, benefit rights were suspended for incapability and not for refusal. (A.B. 916-39; A.B. 1397-39) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Illness between reporting periods resulted in suspension of benefit rights for incapability. (A.B. 594-39) </LI><br><br>
<LI>To maintain his eligible status, claimant must be capable of and available for employment, regardless of whether or not there were jobs actually available in his trade during that period. (A.B. 982-39) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Claimant, afflicted with a mental illness, whose only work experience was with the aid and help of his brother during the canning season and who refused to accept other canning jobs, was held to be incapable of performing work which there was a reasonable possibility of’ obtaining.

<li>Entering a veterans’ domiciliary home for a rest and on the basis of proving inability to work established unavailability. (A.B. 11,963-45; <a href="06.htm#664">A-750-664</a>; similarly A.B. 25,333-50)</li><br><br>
<LI>A claimant with a serious heart ailment which caused him to be retired by employer on disability pension and Physical incapability to perform usual work and preference for a job at a salary which there was no reasonable probability of obtaining constituted unavailability. (A.B. 1311-39; <a href="00.htm#4">A-750-4</a>)</LI><br><br>
<LI>Physical incapability to perform usual work and preference for a job at a salary which there was no reasonable probability of obtaining constituted unavailability. (A.B. 7747-42; <a href="03.htm#383">A-750-383</a>)</li><br><br>
<LI>Physical inability to perform usual work as a machine presser did not disqualify a claimant who was ready, willing, and able to perform sedentary work, which reasonably was obtainable. (A.B. 9745-43; <a href="05.htm#501">A-750-501</a>) </LI><br><br>
<LI>Handicapped workers were capable of employment if they were able to perform some work, which there was a reasonable probability of obtaining. Reasonable probability did not mean that there must be actual placement opportunities in existence at the time. (A.B. 1160-39; similarly, A.B. 966-39) </LI><br><br>
<LI>A notification from the United States Employment Service that claimant was unplaceable in employment, based on a medical report that claimant was not able to work, was held not controlling and insufficient to support a determination of incapability, where the evidence established that claimant had a work history of protracted employment, demonstrating his ability to perform work and remain in the labor market despite his affliction with Parkinson's disease. <br><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<U><P>NOTE</U>: There was no evidence to show that such employment as claimant had, had been, or would be injurious to his health. (A.B. 12,317-45)</P></LI></blockquote>
<LI>Where claimant, a carpenter, suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis but desired light work of any kind and demonstrated his physical ability to work full time prior to and subsequent to filing for benefits, despite his physician's statement that he needed a complete rest for an indefinite period of time and suggestion that he work only three or four hours a day, (statements not quite consistent in themselves) it was concluded that he was available for and capable of employment. <br><br>
<blockquote>
<U><P>NOTE:</U> The doctor’s statement was not an unequivocal assertion that work would be injurious to claimant’s health and was nullified to some extent by the fact that the doctor himself employed the claimant after making the statement. (A.B. 13,159-46; <a href="07.htm#771">A-750-771</a>)</P></li></blockquote><br><br>
<LI>(a)  Discharge for pilfering is not disqualifying when such conduct stems from a psychiatric disorder manifested by a compulsion to steal. <br><br>
<p>(b) A claimant discharged under such circumstances is incapable of employment in the absence of medical evidence that he is no longer suffering from the psychiatric disorder. (A.B. 191,103; <a href="17.htm#1773">A-750-1773</a>) <br><br></ol><br></p>
