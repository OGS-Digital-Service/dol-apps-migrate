of the claimants herein worked in the same automobile repair shop as mechanics
or helpers. All of the claimants filed original claims for benefits in April
1948. Their benefits were suspended for 49 days because of loss of employment
as a result of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which they
were employed. All of the claimants were members of the same union, which had
called a strike against the shop in which the claimants had been employed. The
claimants actively participated in the strike. Claimant D. refiled for benefits
on May 6, 1948, and certified to unemployment through August 8, 1948. An
initial determination was issued disqualifying him from receiving benefits
effective July 21, 1948, because of his refusal of employment an withdrawal
from the labor market and, in the alternative, because of his refusal of
employment without good cause. He was charged with an overpayment of $26, which
resulted from the voiding of effective days, which were credited to him
commencing with July 22, 1948. Claimant R. refiled for benefits on May 5, 1948.
An initial determination was issued ruling him ineligible for benefits as
unavailable for employment effective August 10 because he was not ready to
accept immediate employment. Claimant K. refiled for benefits on May 5, 1948,
and reported through August 22. Initial determinations were issued effective
July 14 and July 20 disqualifying him for refusal of employment without good
cause and in the alternative, ruling him ineligible because of unavailability
effective July 14. He was charged with an overpayment totaling $52 based upon
the voiding of effective days credited to him commencing with July 15. Claimant
C. refiled for benefits on May 5, 1948. An initial determination was issued
effective July 20 disqualifying him for refusal of employment without good
cause and for withdrawal from the labor market and, in the alternative, ruling
him ineligible because of unavailability effective July 14. He was charged with
an overpayment totaling $52 based upon the voiding of effective days credited
to him commencing with July 15. Claimant C. refiled for benefits on May 5,
1948. An initial determination was issued effective July 10 disqualifying him
for refusal of employment without good cause and for withdrawal from the labor
market and, in the alternative, ruling him ineligible for benefits effective
July 19 because of unavailability due to his removal from the labor market. At
the hearing an additional initial determination was issued which was declared to
be the primary initial determination with respect to all claimants ruling them
ineligible as unavailable for employment from the dates of their respective
refiling for benefits, following the termination of the suspension of their
benefits because of the industrial controversy, and because of their withdrawal
from the labor market. Each claimant was charged with an overpayment of all
benefits received subsequent to such refilings. The following facts are
undisputed: During the pendency of the strike against the claimants employer,
which began on March 16, 1948, and which up to the time of the hearings had not
yet been settled, all of the claimants actively participated in the strike by
picketing or being at hand. From the commencement of the strike through the
summer of 1948 and to the latter part of August, 1948, the strike was in the
active stage with picketing. During this period none of the claimants were
permitted to accept employment elsewhere. To do so would have weakened the
strike. Had they accepted employment they would have been subject to
disciplinary action by their union with possible loss of membership in their
union. Outside employment could only have been obtained with the express
permission of the president of the union who also actively participated in the
strike. Had permission been requested to accept outside employment, he would
have denied such request during this period. On August 23, 1948, the claimants
obtained their tools, which until that time had been on the employer’s
premises. Thereafter the strike went into an inactive status and the claimants
were permitted to accept employment elsewhere. The president of the union even
referred several of the claimants to jobs. Two of the claimants thereafter,
namely D. and R., went to business operating an automobile repair shop. The
final certification by each of the claimants herein was August 22, 1948.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We make additional
findings of fact as follows: On July 21, 1948, claimant D. was offered
employment by the employment service. Concededly, the proffered employment was
suitable in all respects. Claimant stated to the employment interviewer that he
would accept the referral, but that he would inform the prospective employer
that he was on strike and would return to his regular job at the termination
thereof. A similar remark made to another prospective employer the previous day
prevented claimant from obtaining work. The offer was thereupon withdrawn.
Claimant R. reported at the employment office on August 10,1948. During the
course of an interview at that time he indicated that his tools were at his
employer’s place of business and that he was unable to procure their return
immediately. Automobile mechanics customarily are required to furnish their own
tools when working on a job. On July 20,1948, claimant K. refused an offer of
suitable employment upon the ground that he believed negotiations between his
union and his former employer would soon terminate. He then expected to return
to work with his former employer. Claimant C. was offered suitable work on July
20, 1948 which he refused solely because of the pendency of the strike. He was
unwilling at that time to consider other employment preferring to await return
to his former employer at the termination of the strike. Except when ill or
when otherwise excused by the president of their union, claimants engaged in
daily picketing of their employer’s establishment. Their union refused to
register claimants for employment while the picketing was in progress.
Claimants requested a hearing before the referee. The referee held that each of
the claimants except R. was unavailable for employment as of the respective
date when each refused suitable work. R. was held unavailable effective the
date on which he indicated inability to accept employment because of a lack of
tools. The Industrial Commissioner and claimants D., K., and R. thereupon
appealed to the Board. At the hearing before the Board the amount of
overpayment in benefits was recomputed as follows: C. $271, K. $245, R. $297
and C. $219.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Appeal Board, 16,956-49, it was held that where a claimant’s sole reason for
refusing employment was to continue with picketing and that under no
circumstances would the claimant accept employment while the strike was in
progress, such a claimant was not in the labor market and, therefore, was
unavailable for employment. It was held in that case that questions involving
refusals of employment became academic. In the instant case, a similar
conclusion is reached because the claimants herein likewise were unwilling to
accept employment while the strike was in progress and because they were under
prohibition against doing so and subject to union disciplinary action if they
accepted employment during this period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>However, we disagree
with the referee’s conclusion as to the respective effective dates of
claimants’ unavailability. It is not disputed that the situation with respect
to claimants’ unwillingness to accept employment did not change materially
during the entire period during which picketing activities were in progress. We
do not subscribe to the referee’s view that the first evidence of claimants’
unavailability was when they refused suitable employment. Refusal employment
was merely additional evidence that they were unavailable for any work other
than the jobs to which they had expectations of returning at the termination of
the strike.&nbsp;<u>Matter of Salavarria</u>, 266 App. Div. 933, affirming
Appeal Board, 7831-42, cited by the referee as precedent for his conclusion as
to the effective date of unavailability, is inapplicable to the situation
presented herein. It follows, therefore, that claimants were unavailable for
employment throughout the reporting period now under consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

draftsman up to August 26,1948 at $7 a day. He was unemployed from that date
and was a claimant for benefits until he entered P. Institute in New York City
on September 20, 1948, as a full-time student to study architecture. Claimant
filed a claim for benefits and registered for employment on April 8, 1949, when
the Easter recess in the institute began, and which ended on April 17, 1949.
After an interview in the local office claimant was ruled unavailable for
employment on the ground that he was a full-time day student during the Easter
recess. Claimant protested and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determination and the Industrial Commissioner appealed to the Board.
Claimant contends that he contacted a number of firms in search of work as an
architectural draftsman, at the rate of $40 per week, and for a job as timekeeper
or something similar. At the hearing before the referee he was unable to name
any of the places he visited. He testified that he had also looked for work as
a soda clerk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Law
is to provide the payment of benefits to qualified employees who are unemployed
through no fault of their own. The record shows that claimant detached himself
from the labor market on September 20, 1948 when he became a full-time day
student in the P. Institute. It may not be said, then, that he was suffering
involuntary unemployment on April 8, 1949. Furthermore, he had no intention of
returning to the labor market, except, as he contends, for the period April 8,
to April 17, 1949. Thus claimant’s attachment to the labor market was extremely
tenuous. We perceive a great difference between this claimant and an employee
who is laid off from his job for a similar period of time. The latter is
involuntarily unemployed and is an active member of the labor force for temporary
or permanent employment. Since concededly claimant had withdrawn from the labor
market during the period of his attendance at the institute and since he
alleges a return to the labor market for the 10-day recess period only, we are
unable to agree with the referee’s disposition of this case. Under these
circumstances we believe there must be clear and convincing proof that the
claimant was actually in the labor market and was anxious and willing to work.
Claimant’s testimony at the hearing and his statements at the local office fall
short of such proof. We reach the conclusion that claimant was unavailable for
employment for the period April 8 to 17, 1949. The initial determination should
have been issued on that basis alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

City from April 26, 1948 to February 28, 1949 when he was laid off. He filed a
claim for benefits and registered for employment on March 2, 1949. Claimant is
a United States Reserve Officer. He reported for active duty as a second
lieutenant in the Army during the period from April 11, 1949 to April 25, 1949,
earning $180.50. This was the rate of pay received by military officers in his
category. He requested this assignment because he &quot;wanted the money&quot;.
His duties consisted of clerical work in connection with &quot;on the job
training&quot;. His hours of work were from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., five days a
week. Claimant contended that if he obtained private employment he would take
the necessary steps to be relieved of this assignment. Claimant at his own
request could be relieved of his duties as an Army officer during his period of
service. In such a case, his application would have to be submitted through the
proper channels and whether or not his request to be relieved of his duties
would be granted was subject to the discretion of his commanding officer.
Claimant admitted that he might encounter difficulty in expediting his request
for leave before his short term of service expired. In the event that his
request for leave was granted his pay would be reduced accordingly. The local
office issued an initial determination that claimant was unavailable for employment
from April 11, 1949 to April 25, 1949. His claim was reinstated as of April 26,
1949. He contested the determination and requested a hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cited has no application to the situation in the instant case. There, the
claimant, an enlisted man, was in the service of the National Guard for a
period of two weeks on a compulsory basis and received only $1 a day for incidental
expenses. It was then the established policy of the National Guard to release
men promptly in cases where an offer of employment was made to an enlisted man
who was unemployed at the time that the entered the service. In the instant
case claimant voluntarily applied for the assignment because he wanted to earn
some money. He received the regular officers' pay for his services. He could
not be released from duty without the approval of his commanding officer. In
the event that he bad applied to be relieved of his duties, it is doubtful
whether, his application could be acted upon before the expiration of his short
period of service. Under all the facts and circumstances, it must be held that
claimant was not available for employment within the meaning of the

However, we are not in accord with the referee’s determination that claimant’s
suspension was not terminated as of the date her former employer discontinued
business. The strike ceased to exist as of the date the employer discontinued
business. The employer-employee relationship ceased as of that date.
Thereafter, claimant’s unemployment was not attributable to the industrial
controversy but to the employer’s decision to go out of business. It follows,
therefore, that when claimant filed for benefits subsequent to the date on
which her former employer had discontinued business, she was unemployed because
of a lack of work. The suspension period should not have been imposed. Our
disposition of this case renders it unnecessary to pass upon the remaining
issue as to whether or not claimant’s employment on April 19 and 20, 1949,
broke the suspension period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1949 as a secretary to the manager of a corporation in New York City. She
started at $45 a week and her terminal pay was $60 a week. She was laid off due
to business conditions. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on March 1, 1949.
She was classified as a secretary. On April 26, 1949 she was referred to a job
as secretary to the vice president of a corporation, paying $55 for a five-day
week. The wages offered were at prevailing rate. Claimant stated that she would
not accept less than $60 a week and requested permission of the employment
interviewer to contact the prospective employer in order to bargain for a
higher salary. According to her signed statement of May 4, 1949, if the
employer offered her $55 to start with an increase to $60 a week after a few
months, she would have accepted the job. In accordance with the policies of the
placement service, claimant’s request was denied. The local office issued an
initial determination holding that claimant refused employment on April 26,
1949 without good cause. At the hearing claimant denied that she refused the
referral in question. She testified that she expressed a preference for $60 a
week in view of her previous experience as a secretary and her short period of
unemployment at the time of the referral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee overruled the determination on the
premise that claimant’s request for an opportunity to contact the employer in
order to discuss the salary question did not constitute a refusal of the offer.
He pointed out that claimant’s stipulation of a salary of $60 a week was merely
an expression of the evaluation of her services and further, since she was
inexperienced, she did not know that she would be required to accept employment
at the prevailing rate. Appeal Board, 16,131-47, on which the referee relied,
is not decisive of the issue herein. The job to which claimant was referred was
in her occupation classification and the wages offered were not substantially
less favorable to her than those prevailing for similar work in the locality.
Whether or not claimant was advised that her refusal to accept employment at
the prevailing rate would result in her disqualification is not material to the
issue (<u>Matter of Turitz</u>, 267 App. Div. 846, reversing Appeal Board
9183-43). A consideration of all circumstances compels the conclusion that
claimant was properly disqualified for refusal of employment without good
cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Case #14,994-47 was for &quot;$35. Up per week;&quot; the claimant was only
told that the wage offered was $35. Denial of referral for the purpose of
bargaining for wages better than $35 was construed by the Appeal Board as
constituting withdrawal of the offer under the circumstances of the case. It
could also be reasoned that the claimant did not refuse the true offer (which
was for $35 up) because it was never made; that, in effect, merely a
non-existing offer was &quot;refused;&quot; and that, as a consequence, there
was no refusal within the meaning of the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(#16,131-47) was at the rate of $35 to $40.&quot; The claimant asked for
permission to negotiate for $40. The Appeal Board found that the prevailing
wage were above $40. Therefore, to the extent that a refusal is involved, it
was with good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the claimant, in a manner similar to that of the case here reported, attempted
to modify a definite and specific offer by a request for permission to
negotiate for more convenient hours of work, is Case #14,920-47. Claimant’s
action constituted a refusal within the meaning of the statute. This refusal
was held to be without good cause under the circumstances of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

first of all, that there is a refusal when a claimant seeks modification of
fixed and definite terms of an offer. Whether such refusal is with or without
good cause will depend on the circumstances of the case. It shows further
regarding job offers at a range of wages or other terms that, even though there
may be a refusal involved, there is not a refusal without good cause when a
claimant insists on a specific minimum level within the range if the terms
which the claimant is not willing to accept are below the prevailing&quot;
standard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant,
a clerical work, filed a claim for benefits on April 5, 1949. By initial
determination, she was ruled ineligible from May 5 through May 16, because of a
failure to report to the insurance office. When claimant filed her claim on
April 5, she was told to report again on April 28 at the insurance office. She
did so and on that day she was interviewed with respect to the termination of
her prior employment. After the conclusion of the interview, an initial
determination dated April 28, was issued by mail disqualifying claimant for 42
days effective April 5 because of voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause. The last paragraph of the termination reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

facts were then reviewed by the insurance office and the initial determination
was withdrawn. Claimant then requested credit for the period from May 5 (her
due date at the insurance office after her appearance there on April 28)
through May 16. The initial determination under review denied that request.

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: These two cases present
the same question of law, were argued together and will be decided
simultaneously. The facts are not in dispute. The Ford Motor Company
(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;company&quot;) is a Delaware corporation
engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling automobiles, trucks and
replacement parts. The company’s executive offices and principal plants are
located in the State of Michigan. In the operation of its business the company
maintains a number of offices, factories, foundries, forges, mills and assembly
plants at various places in different states of the United States and abroad.
Although many of its plants and offices are spread over a large geographical
area, internally the numerous and various operational units are organized to
function in seven groups denominated as divisions, designated as
&quot;operations&quot; on the company’s chart of organization. The divisions
are responsible to the vice president in charge of manufacturing, whose own
staff is one of seven units comprising the company’s entire staff responsible
to the executive vice president.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Two divisions primarily
assemble automobiles. One division is a depot for parts and accessories for
automobiles. Another division is devoted to the company’s business in foreign
countries. The remaining three divisions fabricate, manufacture, supply and
ship to the company’s assembly plants manufactured parts and fabricated
materials essential to the production of its automobiles and trucks. Each
division is in charge of a general manager. The two assembly divisions each
have their own staffs and plants. The Lincoln-Mercury division consists of a
staff and four plants, none of which is located in New York State. The company
assembly operations division, in addition to its staff, consists of fifteen
plants located in a number of states. In the State of New York one of these
plants is located at Buffalo and is designated as the Buffalo assembly plant.
This is the plant in which the claimants, Machcinski, et al, were employed.
Another plant is located at Green Island at which the company manufactures
radiators and springs for Ford cars. It makes approximately 2,800 radiators and
3,500 springs per day. These parts are sent to 17 assembly plants and 10 parts
depots. The number of radiators and springs to be manufactured at Green Island
depends upon the production schedules received from the office of the
vice-president in charge of manufacturing in Michigan. This is the plant at
which the claimant, Muir, was employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>These are test cases,
the decision of which, pursuant to stipulations, will determine the rights of
approximately 1,200 employees at the Buffalo plant and of approximately 375
employees at the Green Island plant. The company’s employees in the River Rouge
plants, and more particularly in the Dearborn assembly plant, where the
controversy arose, are members of a local union, affiliated with the same
international union to which the employees of the Buffalo and Green Island
plants belong. All of the company’s maintenance and production workers in all
of its operations generally work under a master contract between the company
and this international union. Provision is made for handling local issues
between the company and its employees initially on a local basis by the local
union and plant manager. If grievances are not settled after passing through
two stages at the local level in the grievance procedure, the local union may
appeal to the international union for assistance. If the international union is
unsuccessful in reaching an agreement in the matter at issue, the dispute is
returned to the members of the local union to decide whether or not strike
action should be taken. If the membership of the local union votes for a
strike, the results of the vote are certified to the international union for
its approval before the strike may officially be called by the local union. The
company’s employees in the Dearborn plant, early in 1949, became dissatisfied
with the standards of production which the company had the right to establish
for all its assembly plants. The local union having jurisdiction in the River
Rouge plant is Local 600, 4,000 of whose members were employed in what is known
as the &quot;B&quot; building. It formally took the necessary steps under the
established grievance procedures. The grievance not being settled at the local
level, the services of the international union were enlisted. When the
international union failed in its attempt to adjust the grievance in a
satisfactory manner, the membership of Local 600 voted in favor of a strike.
This action was approved by the International union. On May 5, 1949, Local 600
consisting of 65,000 men at the River Rouge plants struck, thereby causing a
complete stoppage of work there. Pickets were at the gates of the River Rouge
plants. No general strike was authorized and none occurred. The strike was
settled on May 29, 1949. The employees of the Buffalo and Green Island plants
took no part in the strike. The agreement, pursuant to which the employees
returned to work in Michigan, was neither submitted to nor concurred in by the
membership of the union at the Buffalo or Green Island plants. The claimants
and their fellow employees at the Buffalo and Green Island plants were at all
times between May 5 and May 28, 1949, the period of the strike, ready and
willing to continue to work at the plants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

these cases filed their clams for unemployment insurance benefits in May 1949,
the Industrial Commissioner issued initial determinations suspending their
rights to benefits for a period of seven consecutive weeks or until the
industrial controversy was settled, whichever occurred first, pursuant to
Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 592, subdivision 1. Claimants requested
hearings before referees and in each case a decision was rendered sustaining
the initial determinations of the Commissioner. Claimants then requested a
hearing before an Appeal Board, which consolidated all the cases and rendered
one decision involving the claim of Machcinski. The other two claimants, as
well as all other claimants at the Buffalo factory, similarly situated,
stipulated to be bound by the decision of the Board in the Machcinski case. The
referee in the Muir case likewise sustained the decision of the Industrial
Commissioner and he also requested a hearing before the Appeal Board. The
Appeal Board reversed all the decisions and held that the suspension provision
did not apply since the River Rouge plants and the Buffalo and Green Island
plants did not constitute one &quot;establishment&quot; as that term is used in
the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The progenitor of
unemployment insurance statutes in English-speaking countries is the British
Unemployment Insurance Act (1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, c. 55-1911). This statute was
passed twenty-four years prior to the enactment of the New York Unemployment
Insurance Law (Laws of 1935, Chapter 468). The suspension provision in the
British statute relating to work stoppages is quite different from our own.
That statute provides that where separate branches of work which are commonly
carried on as separate businesses in separate premises are in any case carried
on in separate departments on the same premises, each of those departments
shall be deemed a separate factory or work shop, as the case may be. Unlike the
British statute, our statute never has used the words, &quot;factory work shop
or other premises,&quot; but merely uses the word &quot;establishment.&quot;
The British statute also contains escape provisions to the effect that the
suspension shall not apply if the claimant is not participating in or financing
or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the work stoppage, and
does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the
commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at
which the stoppage is taking place, any of whom are participating in or
financing or directly interested in the dispute. Our statute contains no such
provisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Most of the sister
states enacted unemployment insurance statutes shortly after 1935. They were
encouraged and assisted by the Federal government in the preparation and
enactment of these laws. As a guide in their preparation, the Federal Social
Security Board in 1936, prepared for the use of the various states a
&quot;draft bill&quot; modeled generally after the British statute. Many of the
states incorporated this provision in their statutes almost verbatim. We never
adopted that statute. Under our law there is no requirement or participation,
financial aid or interest, nor is there any provision which deems separate
branches of work as separate factories, workshops or premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Unemployment
compensation statutes were enacted in various states during a period of
distress and were designed to relieve the hardship caused by unemployment due
to no fault of the employee. The legislative purpose behind the enactment of
our act is to be found in the legislative declaration of public policy in
Section 501. There, the legislature stated that in its considered judgment the
public good and the well being of the wage earners of this state require the
enactment of this measure for the compulsory setting aside of financial
reserves for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.
This is a remedial statute, a humanitarian statute, and should be construed
accordingly. It is the general rule that a liberal construction is accorded
statutes which are regarded by courts as humanitarian or which are grounded on
a humane public policy. In the two cases that we are considering the
unemployment was involuntary. These employees had nothing to do with the
stoppage of work in the Detroit plant. They were not consulted about the work
stoppage or with the prosecution of the strike and clearly they had nothing to
do with the settlement. They are the innocent victims of a situation wholly
beyond their control. The question which we have to decide is whether these
claimants lost their employment because of a strike in the establishment in
which they were employed within the meaning of Section 592, subdivision 1 of
the Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Department of Labor and Industry</u>, 7 NJ Super. 30, subsequently affirmed by
the Supreme Court of New Jersey, ___ NJ ___, rendered a decision construing and
applying the disqualification provision contained in the New Jersey
Unemployment Compensation Law which uses the words &quot;factory, establishment
or other premises at which he is or was last employed.&quot; One of the
claimants there was an employee of Ford Motor Company at its assembly plant at
Edgewater, New Jersey, and the other was an employee of that company at its
assembly plant at Metuchen, New Jersey. They were laid off because of lack of
materials as a result of the May 1949, strike at the Ford plants in Michigan,
the same strike which is involved in these proceedings. These employees filed
for benefits and the question presented was whether they had been employed at
the &quot;factory, establishment or other premises&quot; at which the stoppage
of work occurred. The New Jersey courts apparently refused to follow the&nbsp;<u>Spielmann</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>Chrysler</u>&nbsp;cases,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Combined hearings were
held at which appeared the claimants, their attorneys, the employers, their
attorney, and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner. Testimony was
taken. The parties stipulated that the case of the claimant, James Kenney, be
regarded as typical of the cases involving production workers in the employers’
establishments and that the case of the claimant, Hyman Goldstein, be regarded
as typical of the cases involving the drivers. It was further stipulated that
the cases of all employees of the six employers involved whether included in
the present omnibus proceedings or not, be decided on the basis of this
decision without separate hearings in each case and the claimants through their
attorney waived the statutory notice of hearing in each case. Six employers are
involved. These are Continental Baking Company, Ward Baking Company, Purity Bakeries
Corporation, Grennan Bakeries, Inc., Drake Bakeries, Inc. and General Baking
Company. All manufacture bread and cake in separate establishments located in
New York City. All six, together with other bakeries, participate in an
employers’ organization known as the New York City Bakery Employer Labor
Council. The inside production workers of the employers are members of Local 50
of the Bakery and Confectionery Workers Union. The drivers are members of Local
550, Bakery Drivers Local Union of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
and Chauffeurs. All the claimants filed claims for benefits at various
insurance offices throughout the city o the last day of February or in the
early days of March 1949. By initial determinations effective on different dates,
in or about the period mentioned, their benefits were suspended for seven weeks
for loss of employment due to a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy
in the establishments in which they were employed. The employers reported to
the respective insurance offices that all the claimants had lost their
employment due to a strike. Both unions were represented by the same attorney.
The employers through the Council had negotiated master contracts with both
unions. The contract with Local 550 covering drivers expired on January 31,
1949 and the contract with Local 50 covering production workers expired on May
1, 1949. These master contracts were supplemented by individual contracts with
each of the bakeries. Prior to the expiration of the Local 550 contract,
negotiations were conducted between the Council and the union for an extension
thereof. Demands were made by the union affecting working hours, wages, a
welfare and pension plan and vacations. The employers through the council made
counter-offers which were rejected by the union. The contract was extended
orally in he course of continued negotiations. Since the employers supplied a
substantial percentage of bread consumed in the metropolitan area, appointed a
citizens’ committee to aid in the negotiations. The negotiations continued
until about February 24, when, the employers contended, the president of Local
550 gave oral notice to the employers’ representatives that all six
establishments would be struck. This was denied by the union, which insisted that
only Continental was given a strike notice. On February 25, Local 550 gave
notice by telegram to Continental that a strike by this local would commence on
February 28, at 12:01 a.m. On the same day Local 550 gave similar notice to the
Council that a strike had been called against Continental, that the Local was
advising its members to continue working for the other employers until further
notice and that the union was prepared to continue negotiations on call. On
February 27, the Council sent a telegram to Local 550 acknowledging receipt of
its strike notice against Continental. The telegram stated that in view of this
action and the confusion and uncertainty in connection therewith, in the event
Continental or any of the other companies which are members of the council were
struck by the union, such other companies would cease operations. On February
26 each of the five employers other than Continental, sent telegrams to all of
its workers, including both production workers and drivers, advising them that
because of the strike by Local 550, deliveries could not be made commencing
Monday, February 28, and therefore the employees were not to report for duty
until further notice. On the same day the five employers notified Local 550 of
this action. In all of the establishments except that of Drake, the last day on
which work was done was Saturday, February 26. In the Drake bakery, the drivers
were permitted to make deliveries only on Monday, February 28. Otherwise, all
six plant ceased operation and remained closed to the date of hearing. Prior to
the cessation of operations, Local 550 posted a bulletin dated February 25, in
all of the bakeries, given the status of the negotiations and referring to the
strike notice against Continental, effective February 28. All members of Local
550 employed by other employers were advised to continue working until further
notice unless locked out. The six bakeries operate on a seven day a week basis.
When the production workers and drivers other than those of Continental and Drake
reported for work on February 27 or 28 in accordance with their work schedule,
they found each bakery closed and no employees at work except maintenance
workers, who although members of Local 50, were permitted by the unions to
work. At Drake’s the shut down came on March 1. At Continental, the drivers
immediately began picketing at the time set for the strike and soon thereafter
the production workers joined the picket lines there. Shortly after February
28, pickets appeared at the other five establishments and while the evidence is
not clear as to whether or not the production workers joined with the drivers
immediately in picketing these five establishments, it is conceded that some
production workers were on the picket lines at all six bakeries. The picket
signs at all six bakeries were the same and bore the legend that the workers
had been locked out. At all six bakeries there were materials on hand
sufficient to operate the plants on February 28 and for a substantial period
thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The employers contend
that the employees at all six bakeries lost their employment because of a
strike. The Commissioner’s representative maintains that regardless of whether
or not the cause was a strike or lockout, the suspensions were correctly
issued. The attorney for both unions concedes that all of the workers at
Continental involved in these proceedings lost their employment due to a strike
and no contention is made that the imposition of the seven weeks’ suspension
against the Continental employees was incorrect. The union attorney, however,
maintains that the employees of the other employers are entitled to credit for
benefits immediately upon their respective filings. The attorney for the union
contends that the action taken by the five employers other than Continental
amounted to a &quot;sympathetic lockout,&quot; which condition was not defined
by or referred to by the Legislature in enacting Section 592.1 of the
Unemployment Insurance Law and therefore the statute does not apply. This contention
is of no avail. The Appeal board in 12,521-45 ruled in effect that the label
placed upon particular facts is not controlling but that the Legislature
intended to cover every type of industrial controversy causing loss of
employment. Rather than restricting the definition of the action giving rise to
suspension, the statute broadens it by the words &quot;or other industrial
controversy.&quot; The section above referred to provides for a benefit
suspension in the event of loss of employment &quot;due to a strike, lockout or
other industrial controversy.&quot; It plainly refers to a situation such as
the one involved here. After February 24, 25, negotiations had reached an
impasse. A strike had already been called against one of the employers and the
others not unreasonably anticipated that similar action would be taken against
them and one by one. Their cessation of operations was, under the
circumstances, a unified exhibition of economic power to offset the strike, to
enable the Council to enter later negotiations with increased bargaining power.
The loss of employment at the five employers’ establishments as well as at
Continental was the result of the same industrial controversy. (cf. Fierst and
Spector, Unemployment Compensation in Labor Disputes, 49 Yale L.J. 461, 473.)
In such cases, the statute requires the suspension in order to effectuate a
policy of neutrality in industrial controversies; &quot;The provisions of (the
statute) are in the nature of an assurance to the people of the state that the
state will not participate, insofar as the provisions of this Act may apply,
during the first . . . (seven weeks) thereof.&quot; (Appeal Board, 907-39.) It
was contended by the union that a true lockout exists only to enforce employer
demands and that in respect of the claimants not employed by Continental absent
any demands by the employers, there was only a &quot;sympathetic lockout&quot;
which, it was said, does not warrant a suspension of benefits. Neither of these
contentions is sound. There can be a strike unaccompanied by prior demands by
the workers (<u>Panzieri-Hogan Co. v. Bender</u>, 205 App. Div. 398, affd 237
N.Y. 553;&nbsp;<u>Hawkhurst S.S. Co. v. Keyser</u>, 34 F. 693, affd. 87 F.
1005;&nbsp;<u>Williams Bros. V. W.H. Berghuys Kolonhandel,</u>&nbsp;[K.B. 1915]
86 L.J.K.B. 334. By like reasoning, there can be a lockout without prior
demands by the employers. Strikes and lockouts are parallel if not similar
instruments of economic power &quot;usually for the purpose of adjusting an
existing dispute over the terms of a labor contract.&quot; (Encyclopedia of the
Social Sciences, Vol. 14, p. 419.) Thus, in&nbsp;<u>Atchison</u>,&nbsp;<u>T.S.F.R.
Co. v. Gee</u>, (140 F. 153), it was stated: &quot;In May 1904 there was what
is called a ‘lockout’ at the shops of the railway company at Ft. Madison, Iowa.
This ‘lockout’ was ordered because the employees were just about to enter upon
a strike and the company ordered the machinists discharged, or what is commonly
called a ‘lockout’ before the men could strike.&quot; A lockout has been
defined as &quot;a temporary withholding or shutting down of work by an
employer,&nbsp;<u>in protest against employee actions</u>&nbsp;or to coerce
them into accepting his terms.&quot; (underscoring supplied) (<u>Peterson</u>,&nbsp;<u>American
Labor Unions,</u>&nbsp;p. 260.) In&nbsp;<u>Revere Sugar Refinery v. Marshall</u>,
(CCH Unemployment Insurance Service, Mass., Par. 8130, (not officially
reported), sometime prior to April 4, 1947, a union gave notice to the employer
that a s strike had been authorized and that such stoppage might occur at or
after 12:01 on Saturday, April 6. The employer requested that if a strike were
called, sufficient men would be left on the job to complete the work then in
production. The union refused to give such assurance and on the employer’s
orders 15 to 20 men were laid off on April 4. On April 5, between 180 and 200
men were laid off. The actual strike was voted on April 9 and went into effect
on April 13. The Court held that the workers became unemployed because of a
lockout. In Appeal Board, 822-39, a union and an employer had an agreement
expiring March 31, 1939. In the latter part of March, negotiations were under
way for a renewal and in the employer’s opinion the differences between the
parties were irreconcilable. The employer, in order not to have unfinished
goods on hand on March 31, suspended operations and laid off some of the
workers on March 27. A strike was called on March 31. It was held that
&quot;the act of the employer in denying work to the claimant and other
employees must be deemed the commencement of a lockout.&quot; See also appeal
Board, 6,128-41 wherein the factual background is similar. There a contract was
made between an employer’s association and a union. Negotiations for the
renewal of the contract were had prior to its expiration date. The negotiations
were not consummated by the expiration date. The union thereupon forbade its
members to work for the employers and simultaneously the employers suspended
operations. The Appeal Board ruled that there was loss of employment due to an
industrial controversy even though no picket line was established. Claimants
emphasized that negotiations between the Council and the union had not broken
down (except as to Continental) and that what followed, cannot be the basis of
the benefit suspension. That negotiations may have continued after February 25,
however, is not decisive (<u>Unemployment Compensation Commission v. Aragon</u>,
329 U.S. 143); there were serious points of difference which had already led to
a strike against one member of the Council. The retaliatory action of the other
employers was a lockout requiring the application of Section 592.1. In Selected
Decisions of British Umpire (BU-487, Case No. 437, decided May 29, 1921), it
appeared that some quarrymen employed elsewhere struck to secure a wage
increase. On orders from the employers’ Association, all its members locked out
their employees until the strike was settled. Claimant was so locked out and
contended in support of his benefit application that he had no dispute with his
employers. It was held that &quot;the action of the applicant’s employers in
locking him out in order to support employers in another district extended the
trade dispute to the premises at which the applicant was employed.&quot; The
applicant’s disqualification was sustained. The employers contend that they
deemed the strike against Continental a strike against all employer members of
the Council. That the union was advised of this position, and that accordingly
what ensued was a strike, first against Continental, then against the others. A
short answer to this contention is that a lockout is not converted into a
strike where an employer shuts its plant following a strike against another
employer and with the announcement that the strike is now against the former.

conclusion. The production workers are subject to the same suspensions as are
the drivers even though they were not directly involved at first in the
industrial dispute. See Appeal Board, 13,587-46, where the benefits of bakers

due to a strike of the drivers in the establishment. See also&nbsp;<u>Matter of

find that the last day of work in all of the bakeries except that of Drake was Saturday,
February 26, 1949 and that the last day of work at Drake was February 28.

not work after February 26, 1949, with the exception of two claimants of Local
550, B.D. Union, who are designated as follows: A.D. and H.G. It was also
stipulated that the above last mentioned claimants made deliveries in the
eastern part of Long Island on February 28, 1949. We find as a fact that an
industrial controversy existed in the respective establishments of each of the

the close of business operations on February 26, 1949. The referee’s decision

referee has already rendered well-reasoned opinions in the decisions rendered
by him on June 6 and 16, 1949, we adopt such opinions as the opinion of this
Board. Consistent with the Board’s finding that an industrial controversy
existed at the respective establishments of each of the employers involved
herein, and in conformity with Appeal Board and other precedents in situations
involving similar circumstances, precise characterization of the dispute is
immaterial and unnecessary. It is sufficient for the purposes of the provisions
of Section 592.1 of the Law that an industrial controversy existed in the
establishment at which each of the claimants was employed. We are persuaded
that such was the fact under the circumstances presented in this case.
Pertaining to the employers’ appeal, we are of the opinion that they were in no
wise prejudiced by the decision of the referee insofar as applicable to this
proceeding. It does not appear that the employers were aggrieved by the
referee’s characterization of the dispute. Consequently, they have presented no
appealable issue (Appeal board, 19,265-49). The respective individual initial
determinations of the various local offices, suspending the accumulation of
benefit rights of the claimants herein for a period of seven consecutive weeks
upon the ground that said claimants lost their employment because of a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which each was
employed, are sustained except as to the claimants employed by D.B. Inc. The
respective individual initial determinations of the various local offices
affecting claimants employed by D.B. Inc. are modified by making February 27,
1949, the effective date of each, and as so modified, are sustained. The
initial determinations affecting claimants A.D. and H.G. should be made
effective as of March 1, 1949. The appeal of the employers is dismissed. The
decisions of the referee are modified accordingly and, as so modified, are
affirmed. A separate order is to be entered in each case. (February 10, 1950)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The employer operates a brewery in the Borough
of Manhattan, City of New York. It also maintains several distributing bases
throughout the metropolitan area. On April 1, 1949 at 2 a.m., a strike of the
production workers and delivery personnel commenced at the employer’s
establishment. Claimants were not involved in nor did they participate in the
strike in any manner. The present claimants are employees who were engaged as
salesperson, clerks, maintenance personnel and in other administrative
capacities. Except as hereinafter set forth they were not members of any labor
union. Claimant O.H., employed as a carpenter, was a member of the labor union
having jurisdiction over his occupation. Claimants F.R.L. and P.F. (Local
Office 524) were employed as plumbers engaged in the maintenance of beer taps
and beer dispensing equipment. They were members of the labor union exercising
jurisdiction over their craft. None of these three claimants was involved in
the dispute at the employer’s establishment. However, they respected the picket
line established at the employer’s plant by the striking union and refused to
report to work so long as the picket line was maintained. Except for the
payment of vacation pay covering the period from April 11 through April 22,
1949, these particular claimants received no remuneration whatsoever until they
resumed work at the termination of the strike on June 21, 1949. The remainder
of the present claimants continued to receive their regular semi-monthly
salaries on the first and fifteenth days of each month until May 15, 1949, when
the employer discontinued such payments. Some of the claimants, notably clerks,
were continuously occupied at their respective jobs from the commencement of
the strike through May 15, 1949, except for brief vacations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimants P.F. (Local
Office 511) and R.E.W. were among those workers so occupied. Their services
were dispensed with after May 15, 1949 due to a lack of work occasioned by the
continuation of the controversy in the employer’s establishment. The other
claimants were maintained on a stand-by basis, subject to call at the
employer’s option upon 24 hours notice. The latter did not render any services
from April 8, 1949 until after the termination of the strike. The employer had
an established policy of awarding one day of paid vacation to every employee
for each month of employment for the first year in which a person was employed.
Thereafter an employee received two weeks vacation with pay annually. Pursuant
to this policy, the annual paid vacation period was advanced to coincide with
the period in which claimants received their regular salaries during the course
of the strike. The same vacation policy was applied to the three maintenance
employees who refused to cross the picket line and who were deemed ineligible
by the employer to receive their regular semi-monthly salaries. The regular and
vacation payments made during the period ending May 15, 1949 were treated as
salaries by the employer for all purposes including unemployment insurance
contributions, social security and withholding taxes, workmen’s compensation
and corporate income taxes. Based upon information received from the employer,
the various local offices issued individual initial determinations suspending
the right of each claimant to receive benefits for a period of 49 consecutive
days upon the ground that claimants lost their employment because of a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed. Each of the claimants requested a hearing and the referee modified
the initial determination in each case by fixing the effective date thereof as
April 9, 1949 for all claimants except claimant H.G., in whose case the
effective date was fixed as April 8, 1949; the claimant D.H., in whose case the
effective date was fixed as April 16, 1949; the claimants P.B., P.D.P., E.C.,
H.H.T., W.J.D. and L.J., in whose cases the effective date was fixed as April
23, 1949 and the case of claimant P.F. (Local Office 511), in whose case the
effective date of suspension was fixed as May 16, 1949. In the case of claimant
F.E.W. the referee modified the initial determination of the local office by
fixing the date of suspension of benefit rights as May 14, 1949. With respect
to claimants O.H., F.R.L. and P.F. (Local Office 524), the referee modified the
respective initial determinations of the local offices in each case by fixing
the effective date of suspension of benefit rights of said claimants as April
2, 1949. The Industrial Commissioner and claimants P.F. (Local Office 511) and
F.E.W. thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in modifying the individual
initial determinations of the respective local offices, based his conclusion
upon the premise that claimants lost their employment as a result of a strike,
lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed, on the day following which they rendered no services to the employer.
We do not subscribe to this view except with respect to the cases of the three
employees who were terminated from the payroll because of their refusal to
cross the picket line. We are not in accord with the referee’s conclusion that
to all intents and purposes claimants, with the exceptions noted, were laid off
for an indefinite period starting April 8, 1949. The fact that they rendered no
services to the employer and were not called upon to do so, is not decisive of
the issue herein. They were at the employer’s beck and call at all times during
the period for which they were paid their customary salaries. The remuneration
paid them was deemed salary for all purposes. Consequently, it cannot be said
that such payment amounted to a gratuitous act on the part of the employer. The
annual vacation period was advanced by the employer for its convenience in
order to take advantage of the temporary lull in productivity due to the
industrial controversy existing in the establishment. Significantly, claimants
were not given additional vacations during the customary annual vacation
period. We are convinced that these claimants were not totally unemployed
during the period for which they received their regular salaries or paid
vacations even though the employer temporarily waived rendition of services. So
long as claimants continued to draw salaries regularly, they were not totally
unemployed. When their pay was discontinued on May 15, 1949, claimants’ lack of
employment thereafter was directly attributable to the strike in the establishment.
With respect to those claimants who actually rendered services while being
paid, clearly, they were not totally unemployed during the entire period in
which they were actively engaged. Their subsequent layoff starting May 16,
1949, during the pendency of the controversy, was likewise directly
attributable to the existence of the dispute. Consequently, their loss of
employment was due to a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed. With respect to claimants O.H.,
F.R.L and P.F (Local Office 524), there appears to be no dispute that their
employment terminated on April 1, 1949 because of the existence of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed. The
vacation pay, which they received during the period of their layoff is
inconsequential in that their benefit rights had been suspended at the time and
in no event were they entitled to benefits for that period. Moreover, their
layoff was for the duration of the strike, an indefinite period. When these
claimants received their vacation pay the date of their return to employment
was indefinite. We therefore agree with the referee’s disposition herein
insofar as applicable to these three claimants. The contention of claimants
F.E.W. and P.F. (Local Office 511) that their loss of employment was not due to
a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which
they were employed, is untenable. Their unemployment was due solely to the
existence of the industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed and their benefit rights were properly suspended on May 15,1 949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employed on a fulltime basis from July 1947 to September 1948. Upon the advice
of her physician she left this employment because it produced an adverse effect
upon her health. Thereafter, for a period of approximately six months claimant
was engaged in part-time work. This employment consisted of typing performed at
her home for several employers. It was customary for claimant to pick up and
deliver work thus assigned to her. Claimant was compelled to discontinue such
employment because of inability to travel to and from her home to the
establishments maintained by such employers. Claimant filed for benefits on
March 30, 1949, at which time she was seeking part-time employment. She was
unwilling to accept a full-time job because of her physician's admonition
against acceptance of such work. On April 29, 1949, in an interview at the
local office, claimant signed a statement disclosing this information. She had
worked full-time on April 27, 1949, at her customary occupation. Claimant was
compelled to discontinue such work after one day because of the harmful effect
upon her physical condition. Commencing June 16, 1949, claimant became
re-employed at her customary occupation on a part-time basis. The duration of
such employment was several weeks. For a period of three weeks starting July 8,
1949, claimant was employed on a full-time basis. Based upon the interview she
had at the local office on April 29, 1949, an initial determination was issued,
effective March 30, 1949, holding claimant ineligible for benefits upon the
ground that she was unavailable due to her inability to accept full-time
employment. Claimant requested a hearing and the referee modified the initial
determination of the local office to the extent of making the effective date
there of April 29, 1949. The Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination of the local office fixed the effective date of claimant's
disqualification as April 29, 1949, reasoning that that was the first day on
which there was any evidence of unavailability. We do not subscribe to this
view. The initial determination of unavailability admittedly was based upon
claimant's presumed ability to accept part-time employment only. It was alleged
that she had been a full-time worker. Claimant's unavailability was improperly
based upon this ground. The record indicates that for at least six months prior
to filing for benefits, claimant worked on a part-time basis. In our opinion
this satisfactorily established a pattern of part-time employment under the
circumstances herein. However, it appears that at the time claimant filed for
benefits she was physically incapable of performing any of the duties of her
customary occupation. Consequently, she was unavailable for employment. This
view is buttressed by her subsequent inability to work after but one day of
such employment during the period in question due to physical causes. It
appears however that starting June 16, 1949 claimant was again able to resume
her former occupation on a part-time basis. Commencing with that date she again
became available for and capable of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to March 20, 1949. On March 21 he obtained another job. He advised the foreman
on that job that he could work for only three weeks as he was leaving for
Sweden. He worked until April 8. Work was available for him at the date he left
his employment. One week later he left on his trip. Upon his return from
Sweden, claimant filed a claim for benefits on August 24, 1949. By initial
determination dated September 12,1 949 claimant was disqualified from benefits
for six weeks to October 4, 1949 for voluntary leaving of employment without

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee overruled the initial
determination of voluntary leaving and held that claimant’s desire to visit his
family after a lapse of many years and the difficulties of obtaining
transportation justified his leaving the work, which he had accepted on a
temporary basis while awaiting his previously arranged trip to Sweden. He
stated further that, in effect, claimant withdrew from the labor market for the
purpose of making this trip. The Commissioner argues on this appeal that the
leaving for the purpose of a visit was for such a purely personal reason as not
to constitute good cause for the quit. We believe the Commissioner’s position
in this matter must prevail. When claimant left his employment on April 8,
1949, the employer had work for him. The fact that he accepted the job for
three weeks does not alter the effect of his leaving, so far as his right to
unemployment insurance is concerned. The reasons advanced by claimant for
quitting his temporary job were purely personal and were not of such a
character as to constitute good cause for voluntary leaving of employment
within the meaning of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worked for 34 years ending June 10, 1949 as a sole leather roller in a shoe
factory in Endicott, New York, earning $1.39 an hour. He was laid off on June
10, 1949 due to lack of work and he was to return to work on July 12, 1949,
which he failed to do. Claimant elected to retire effective June 30, 1949 and
applied to the employer for his pension, which was granted in the sum of $62.86
per month. He also collected social security benefits in the sum of $37 a
month. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on June 13, 1949. The local office
issued initial determination, effective July 1, 1949, that he was unavailable
for employment. The basis for the determination was that claimant voluntarily
retired, indicating withdrawal from the labor market. At the hearing the
Industrial Commissioner issued an alternate determination that claimant
voluntarily left his employment without good cause. Claimant left his
employment because the work was of a strenuous nature and due to his advanced
age he was not physically fit to continue it. He expressed a willingness to do
light work. This was available in the employer’s establishment at 99 cents an
hour and the employer was &quot;willing to transfer him to such light work had
he requested it. However, claimant's reason for not requesting the transfer was
that the employer's rate of pay for light work was too low. Claimant stated
that he was available for work such as a watchman with other employers. He
admitted that he would lose his pension if he returned to work for his former
employer. He applied for work at two other firms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

elected to retire. In addition to his pension from the employer, he received
old age retirement benefits. Although light work was available in the
employer's plant, he chose not to request a transfer to another department
because the rate paid for the type of work which he was capable of doing was
inadequate. Considering claimant's age, the circumstances under which he left

     unusual for him to seek other work. There may, of course, be exceptional
     circumstances such as physical limitations in the performance of the
     customary work and no possibility of assignment to &quot;lighter&quot;

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a full-charge bookkeeper, was
employed with a firm in the City of New York for approximately five years
ending October 8, 1948. She voluntarily left her employment on that date due to
pregnancy. Claimant’s final salary was $350 per month. On April 5, 1949, after
the birth of her child, claimant filed an original claim for benefits.
Concededly, she was unavailable for employment and did not report at the local
office again until May 2, 1949, when she refiled. On April 29, 1949, claimant
changed her residence from New York City to West Hempstead, Long Island, a
community located outside the territorial limits of the City of New York.
Claimant’s mother-in-law took up residence with her at West Hempstead and was
available for the care of claimant’s infant child in the event claimant became
employed. On July 19, 1949, claimant was offered employment in her customary
occupation at $40 per week in a locality near the town in which she had her
residence. Claimant refused the proffered employment solely upon the ground
that she deemed the salary insufficient. She demanded a minimum of $55 a week.
Evidence before the Board indicates that the prevailing rate for claimant’s
occupation, in the locality of the job offer, was approximately $40 weekly.
Claimant expressed a willingness to accept employment in New York City where
salaries for her occupation were somewhat higher. During the period of her
unemployment, claimant contacted her former employer on one occasion in search
of employment. She also visited the New York office of the state employment
service on two occasions, the last of which was in June 1949. Claimant’s other
efforts to obtain employment were confined to the locality in which she
resides. A communication received from claimant, dated March 25, 1950,
indicates that she had been continuously unemployed as of that date. Based upon
claimant’s refusal of employment, the local office made an initial
determination disqualifying her from receiving benefits upon the ground that
such refusal was without good cause. Claimant requested a hearing and the
referee overruled the initial determination of the local office. The Industrial
Commissioner appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in overruling the initial
determination, concluded that claimant was justified in refusing the proffered
employment because the salary offered was substantially less favorable to her
than the rate prevailing for similar work in the New York Labor market. We do
not concur in the conclusion reached by the referee. The employment in question
offered remuneration in line with the prevailing wage in the locality in which
the job opening existed. Claimant’s contention that she was available for
employment in New York City is not borne out by the record. Her efforts to find
employment were sporadic and insufficient to support the referee’s conclusion
that claimant continued to be an active member of the New York labor market.
Claimant’s efforts to obtain employment appear to have been mainly confined to
the locality in which she had her residence. Since the job offer did not
involve a salary substantially less favorable to claimant than the rate
prevailing for her occupation in that area, it follows that her refusal of the
employment was without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant filed for benefits on June 6, 1949. By initial
determination, she was disqualified for a refusal of employment without good
cause effective August 8. She was also declared ineligible because of
unavailability for employment effective August 8. At the hearing, an additional
determination was introduced, disqualifying claimant for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause for 42 days effective August 9. Claimant is a
Tuesday reporter, and reported to the insurance office on Tuesday, August 9.
Claimant is a sewing machine operator. She has experience on coats, dresses and
blouses. She was last employed for nine months in a blouse factory until June
1949, when she was laid off because of lack of work. On August 8, she had an
opportunity to return to her former establishment as production had started
again. She refused, however, to return because she would have been compelled to
join a union. Claimant’s objection to joining the union was that she would have
had to pay an initiation fee of $18 and would have been compelled to attend meetings
occasionally. Claimant customarily earned $55 to $60 a week when she was last
employed. She is ready, willing and able to work and is prepared to accept even
less than she formerly earned. Claimant has also reconsidered her former
opposition to joining a union and would accept employment even if she was
required to join such organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

voluntarily left her last employment without good cause. Claimant did not
refuse an offer of employment with another employer. She had an opportunity to
return to her former job where the employment relationship had never been
severed, but merely suspended. She rejected this opportunity because she did
not wish to join a union. That reason was not sufficient under the Unemployment
Insurance Law, and, accordingly, claimant must be disqualified for 42 days effective
August 9. There is no evidence of unavailability for employment after this
period of disqualification. Claimant appears to be ready, willing and able to
work and has removed all restrictions as to joining a union. The initial
determinations of refusal and unavailability are overruled. The initial
determination of voluntary leaving is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

adopted the findings of fact of the referee we do not concur in the conclusion
reached by him. This case is distinguishable from appeal Board, 19,644-49,
cited by the referee. In that case the layoff was for a definite period and the
employment did not terminate until the claimant, upon her return to work,
advised the employer that she was leaving his employ. In the instant case the
layoff was absolute and the relationship of employer and employee was
terminated at the time the layoff commenced. The claimant at that time was
removed from the employer’s payroll. Claimant actually refused employment with
her former employer at the time that the offer of employment was made. This was
a new contract of employment and had no bearing upon her former status with the
employer. In view of this, the Board concludes that the claimant, without good
cause, refused employment for which she was reasonably fitted by training and
experience. The initial determination disqualifying claimant for refusal of
employment is sustained. The initial determination of voluntary leaving is
overruled. The initial determination of unavailability is academic in view of
this decision. The decision of the referee is reversed. (Dated February 24,

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which representatives of
the employer and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified.
Claimant, a refrigeration engineer, refiled a claim for benefits on March 29,
1949. By an initial determination effective that day, claimant was disqualified
for 42 days because it was ruled that he voluntarily left his employment
without good cause. Claimant was employed for approximately eight and a half
months, to March 14, 1949, when he signed off the SS Argentina in New York. A
hearing was held on May 23, 1949, at which the employer failed to appear. By
decision dated June 7, the initial determination was overruled because upon the
evidence submitted at the hearing it was found that the claimant did not sign
on again because of the continuing effect of a back injury which he sustained
during the course of his employment. The employer applied for re-opening of the
case because it had not received the notice of hearing. At the hearing, the
employer and the insurance representative consented to have the record in Case
532-420-49R made part of the record of this case since the claimant had in that
case testified in regard to his reasons for the termination of his employment.
The employer, by the terms of its contract, is required to allow a seaman to
take a &quot;trip off&quot; upon an application being made by the seaman for
such privilege. It is the employer’s contention that the claimant knew, or
should have known, of this procedure, and that if he was physically unable to
go to work on March 18 when the vessel sailed from New York, that he should
have made such application and his job would have been kept open for him when
the vessel returned to New York. The vessel sailed on March 18. The round trip
takes 38 days. Claimant, when interviewed in the insurance office, stated that
he was not able to work from March 14 for a period of two weeks, and that he
was able to work at the time he refiled his claim on March 29. He further
stated that he did not ask for &quot;relief trip&quot; because he did not know
how long his back wold bother him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The employer’s
application to reopen Case 532-420-49R is granted. I am accepting the
claimant’s statement made in the insurance office at the hearing previously
held that he was not able to work on March 14 due to a physical condition, and
that he was able to work on March 29, when he refiled his claim. Under such
circumstances, the claimant should have requested the employer to be permitted
to remain off the vessel for its ensuing trip, which application would have
been granted. The claimant’s failure to make such application because he did
not know how long his back would ache does not present a reasonable explanation
for failing to make an effort to preserve his job if, he was able to work when
the vessel returned to New York. According to the claimant, had he made such
application he would have had his job back in 38 days, since he was able to work
within two weeks. Under the circumstances, the claimant did not act reasonably.
The initial determination is accordingly sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ending July 30, 1948 he had worked as an agent for a large life insurance
company. He was retired on the latter date. Under the provisions of the
company’s insurance and retirement program the normal retirement age for its
male employees is 65 years. However, if an contributor requests, and the
company approves such request, the contributor may be permitted to continue as
an active agent for an additional period of one year. The contributor may also
request further extensions on a year-to-year basis until he reaches he 70
birthday. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on September 9,1949. The local
office obtained information from the employer that claimant did not request an
extension of his retirement. Claimant’s reason for not requesting such an
extension was that allegedly he heard the superintendent of the company state
at a meeting in his office that such an application would not be granted to any
employee reaching the normal retirement age. The local office issued an initial
determination that claimant was unavailable for employment effective September
9,1949. The determination was based on information received from the employer
that claimant did not request an extension of his retirement. Claimant was
retired at a pension of $122 per month. In addition, he collected $42 per month
in old age retirement benefits under the Federal Social Security Act. Claimant
is in good health and declared his willingness to accept a selling job in a
retail business or trade paying at least $60 a week. Claimant testified that
his efforts to obtain employment were unsuccessful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole issue on this appeal is whether or
not claimant was available for employment. Claimant’s work experience is
limited to the solicitation of life insurance. Although he had an opportunity
to continue in the employment to which his experience was limited, he failed to
take advantage of such opportunity. He accepted retirement although he was
entitled to apply for a deferment of his retirement on a year-to-year basis
until he reached the age of 70. In the light of this conduct, claimant’s
alleged willingness to accept employment in the selling field, becomes highly
doubtful. This particularly so in view of his insistence on a salary of $60 per
week which he has no reasonable prospect of obtaining in view of his lack of
experience in any other field except in the sale of life insurance. We are
convinced that claimant is not in the labor market at least as of the date of
his filing for benefits on September 9, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her voluntary leaving as follows: &quot;lack of opportunity – boss was
prejudiced.&quot; The employer reported to the local office that she left
because she was &quot;not satisfied with rate of progress.&quot; The local
office issued an initial determination that claimant voluntarily left her
employment without food cause. Claimant is 22 years of age and was graduated
from college in August 1947. In connection with her course she studied
commercial subjects and social sciences. She worked from May 1948 to September
2, 1949 in the billing department of a fabric manufacturer. She started as a
billing clerk at a salary of $37.50 a week. Effective December 1, 1948 her
salary was increased to $40 a week. In April 1949 she was assigned the duties
of an IBM electromatic operator. No definite promise of promotion or increase
in salary was made to claimant at the time she was hired. It was customary for
the firm to review the service record of each employee each six months and to
grant periodic raises if warranted by the work record of the employee. In July
1949 the employer made some changes in the personnel of the billing department.
A male employee occupying the position of Grade II Clerk in the billing
department was discharged. The employer appointed another employee who had
previously occupied the position of Grade I Clerk to fill the vacancy. This
person was a male employee, 19 years of age, who had some high school training
and had entered the employ of the company sometime after claimant. Claimant at
that time performed the duties of an IBM machine operator and occupied a
position which was in the intermediate grade between Grade II and Grade I. The
employer considered claimant a capable employee. However, she was not promoted
to the higher job because management believed that she lacked sufficient
initiative, &quot;drive&quot; and interest, which were required to perform the
job properly. Claimant voluntarily left her employment on September 2, 1949
because she felt aggrieved that another person who was younger, who had less
formal education and seniority was promoted to the higher job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reason for leaving her employment was that she was disappointed in not being

qualifications for the job in question and to make promotions in the

voluntarily quit his job on the latter date to enter into business with a
partner in the operation of a gasoline service station. After three months, he

within the meaning of the law. A careful consideration of the issue herein
leads us to the conclusion that claimant had good cause for leaving. His
motives in establishing himself in business in order to better his status have
not been questioned. Under our free economic system, encouragement should be
lent to the enterprising, who seek in this way to better themselves. This we
believe to be socially beneficial and hence to constitute good cause within the
law. A similar view is taken in other jurisdictions. The New Jersey Board of

principle of our free enterprise system that a man can quit whenever he wants
to do so if he thinks he can better himself. Quitting to better one’s self is
definitely not a bad cause. The New Jersey Legislature by specifically
excluding the words ‘connected with his work’ from the voluntary leaving
provision, intended a claimant to be relieved from disqualification if he quit
for any good cause regardless of whether or not such cause is connected with
his work. Any cause which is socially beneficial is a good cause. And since leaving
a job to go into self employment is socially beneficial, it is, therefore, a

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant filed an interstate claim for benefits
against the State of New York in Danville, Virginia on September 2, 1948. She
had last worked as a sewing machine operator in New York, which job she left to
return with her husband to her former home in Danville. By initial
determination she was disqualified for voluntary leaving of employment and
withdrawal from the labor market. She did not contest this determination.
Claimant refiled in Danville on December 9, 1948 and on such filing it was
determined that she had returned to the labor market. After the expiration of
the six-week penalty period for voluntary leaving, claimant received four
benefit payments to sometime in March 1949. On April 7, 1949 the Out-of-State
Resident Union issued another initial determination disqualifying claimant from
benefits effective March 14, 1949 on the basis of a letter from her that she
lived &quot;in the country&quot; and &quot;didn’t have the money to look for a
job.&quot; Copy of the determination was mailed to claimant. On May 20, 1949
claimant by letter protested the determination, stating that she was available
for work. Claimant resides two blocks outside of the city limits of Danville on
a business line running to the city at about 15 minute intervals. It takes her
about 20 to 25 minutes to reach the center of the city. Claimant reported
weekly at the local employment office. She at no time imposed any restrictions
as to the type of work she would accept. She applied for work at a department
store as a maid. She sought work at a local tobacco factory and at a large
cotton mill and also in a restaurant. No employment was offered her by the
local employment service until August 25, 1949 when, according to a report from
that office, claimant refused a referral to a domestic service job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The first question to be decided on this
appeal is whether claimant made a timely request for a hearing. The initial
determination was issued on April 7, 1949. Concededly, claimant made no protest
of the determination to any person in authority, either in person or by written
communication, until May 20, 1949, when she wrote to Albany. Therefore,
claimant is not entitled to a hearing as to her alleged availability prior to
May 1, 1949. The Industrial Commissioner concedes that claimant has a right to
be heard only on the question of her continuing availability from May 1, 1949,
which is 20 days prior to her request for a hearing. However, we find no basis
for disturbing the referee’s decision on the merits of the issue of claimant’s
availability with respect to the period commencing May 1,1949 and continuing
until August 25, 1949. As the referee pointed out, claimant was willing to
accept any employment without restriction, she made diligent efforts to find
work and her continued unemployment was due to a lack of work in the area for
her. The original initial determination of April 7, 1949 was based on the
apparent misconception that claimant was residing in an area inaccessible to
any employment and that claimant had made no effort to seek work. The record is
sufficiently clear that this was not in accordance with the true facts. As to
the period commencing August 25, 1949, doubt exists as to claimant’s
eligibility for benefits in view of the report that she refused a referral of
employment as a domestic on that day. This case is therefore sent back to the
Out-of-State Resident for further inquiry and a new initial determination on
the issue of claimant’s eligibility for benefits on an after August 25, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

approximately two years employment in a bank. Initially she was engaged in the
capacity of receptionist; later she worked as file clerk. Claimant voluntarily
terminated such employment in October 1948 because of pregnancy. On August 18,
1949, after the birth of her child, claimant reentered the labor market and
filed for benefits. She did not seek re-employment with her former employer
because she was unwilling to do filing. Claimant desired employment as a
receptionist only. In October 1949, she concluded that it would be difficult
for her to obtain such employment since those jobs generally require experience
operating a switchboard. Claimant was not qualified for such work. Thereafter,
she was willing to accept, employment as a retail sales clerk. Claimant and her
husband maintain their residence in the Borough of Brooklyn, City of New York.
He is gainfully employed. Claimant’s mother, age 62, resides on Staten Island,
New York. The mother suffers from arthritis, requiring frequent treatment for that
condition. Claimant maintained that her infant child was in the care of her
mother while she, claimant, searched for employment. She stated that the same
arrangement was possible if she succeeded in obtaining a job. From September 10
through September 18,1949, claimant personally looked after her child because
the baby was ill during that period. The local office made an initial
determination holding claimant ineligible for benefits, effective the date of
filing, upon the ground that she unavailable for employment. Claimant requested
a hearing and the referee overruled the initial determination of the local
office. The Industrial Commissioner appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination of the local office, concluded that claimant’s domestic
responsibilities did not prevent or interfere with her seeking or holding
employment. We are not in accord with this view. Claimant’s infant child is of
tender age requiring considerable parental care. During some portion of
claimant’s reporting period the child was ill, requiring the personal
ministration of its mother. Concededly, during, this period , claimant was
unavailable for employment. We reject claimant's contention that her mother was
in a position to care for the child. The mother’s age and physical condition
render this contention of claimant tenable. Moreover, it would appear that the
distance separating claimant' s residence from her mother's home would pose
definite obstacles to such an arrangement. We are unimpressed with claimant’s
alleged efforts to obtain employment. Our conclusion in this respect is
bolstered by her failure to seek reemployment with her former employer. The
sole reason advanced by claimant for her action was that she found the duties
of her last position obnoxious. In the single instance in which claimant was
able to furnish any information regarding her effort in search of employment,
the information was found to be unreliable upon being checked by the local
office. Claimant’s original restriction to receptionist work, was a barrier to
employment due to her lack of required qualifications. She allegedly sought
employment in another field when she awakened to this realization. Claimant’s
efforts in this direction were sporadic only. She evinced no genuine desire for
work. Upon all the facts and circumstances herein, we are persuaded that
claimant was unavailable for employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

witness, his union attorney, a representative of and a witness for the
employer, and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. Claimant refiled for benefits on December 26, 1949. An
initial determination was issued disqualifying him as of January 26, 1950 for
refusal of employment without good cause. It was further determined, in
consequence, that he was overpaid $52 in benefits. Claimant worked as a lugger
for a parcel delivery service in New York City. He was a member of a teamsters’
union which was in contractual relationship with his employer. The employer
employed about 2100 persons who were members of the union, of which
approximately 84 were subject to emergency recall. Article VII Paragraph 5 of
the contract between the employer and the union provided as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

three days, until a more senior man requests and makes himself available for

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant worked for the
employer at various times between November 15, 1947 and January 17, 1950. His
employment on August 12 and September 12, 1949, was emergency re-employment of
one day’s duration. On January 25, 1950, he was contacted by the employer for
work the following day. He refused to accept one day of employment, contending
that under the union agreement he was entitled to a minimum of three days’
employment. His refusal resulted in the issuance of the initial determination.
At the hearing, claimant’s union attorney and an official of the union
contended and testified that early in 1948 the union had posted notices on
bulletin boards where its members worked for the employer, telling them in
substance that the employer was not entitled to recall them for less than three
days of employment. With the consent of all parties herein, a copy of said
notice was submitted for the Referee’s consideration subsequent to the hearing.
The notice read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

ALL SHOP STEWARDS: Kindly be advised that the contract between ourselves and
United Parcel Service provides that you do not lose your seniority unless you
are offered regular employment. In the future, in order to gain regular
employment, we advise that you do not report for work unless you are guaranteed
three (3) days in any calendar week.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The employer’s
representative conceded that the notice had been posted, but stated that the
employer never ratified it or consented to its contents. The testimony of the
employer’s representatives indicated that it chose not to create any issue with
the union concerning the notice. As explained by them, it was not a matter of
great importance to the employer if a particular employee refused to respond to
an emergency recall of less than three days’ duration, since if he did not do
so, the employer would merely go down the list and eventually another employee
would respond. The evidence indicated that in many instances employees were
recalled for less than three days of work. The union attorney and its witness
contended that under its contract with the employer the minimum period of recall
was three days. They declared that the union never took disciplinary action
against any member who was recalled and worked for less than three days,
explaining that no complaints concerning such brief employment had been made to
the union and, therefore, it had no official knowledge thereof. It was admitted
by the employer that claimant’s refusal to work on January 26, did not
jeopardize his status as an employee and union member subject to recall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: There is no question
but that employment on January 26, 1950, was offered to claimant and was
refused by him. It was his regular line of work. There is nothing in this
record to indicate that he had good cause under the Unemployment Insurance Law
to refuse the offer. The evidence established that the employer was empowered
to recall claimant to work, and that it did so pursuant to the terms of Article
VII, Paragraph 5, of its agreement with the union, quoted above. The
contractual provision was not altered or annulled by the notice posted by the
union. The union’s notice merely constituted advice by the union to its
members. There is no evidence that any union member who disregarded the advice
would thereby have jeopardized his membership in his union. It is to be noted
that during the period that the notice was posted, claimant was recalled on two
separate occasions for only one day of work. Despite the union’s disclaimer of
&quot;official knowledge&quot; of acceptance by its members of work of less
than three days duration, I am satisfied it was aware of the fact that the
employer operated in accordance with the contractual provision quoted above. I
am satisfied, also, that the union did not regard the acceptance of such
short-term employment as warranting disciplinary action against any of its
members. In conclusion, it may also be observed that the instant proceeding is
not concerned with the efforts of the union to secure better terms of
employment for its members, either within or dehors the framework of its
contract with the employer, but solely with the correctness of the initial
determination under the Law. The initial determinations are sustained. Claimant
was overpaid $52 in benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

York in June 1946. Claimant is 30 years of age, married and has a 2½ year old
son. After admission to the Bar he endeavored to secure a position with a law
firm. He found that it was practically impossible to do so since such positions
can usually only be secured through personal interviews and his working hours
as a haberdashery salesman prevented him from calling upon attorneys. Under the
circumstances, he finally felt impelled to leave his position in order to
facilitate his chances of securing employment with a law firm. Claimant
testified that he would not have left his job if his hours had not been such as
to preclude the possibility of contacting law firms during the day. He
subsequently obtained another position as a haberdashery salesman with working
hours of from about 3 p.m. until 11 p.m., five days a week and was so employed

while employed as a salesman. These circumstances developed while he was employed.

September 6, 1949, he was employed by John Forsythe Co., Inc., of New York City
as a haberdashery salesman and had been so employed for 6½ years. This was
full-time employment, six days a week. While so employed he attended law school
at night, was graduated and was admitted to the Bar of this State in June 1946.
After his admission to the Bar he endeavored to secure a position with a law
firm but found that impossible, due to some extent because his working hours
were such that he was unable to make personal calls upon attorneys. For that
reason he left his position as a salesman. He testified that he would not have
left that position if his hours of employment had not been such as to preclude
the possibility of contacting law firms during the day. Subsequently, and on
September 27, 1949, he obtained another position as a haberdashery salesman
with Hobbs-Troff Company where his working hours were from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m.,
five days a week and he was so employed at the time of the hearing before the
referee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Board found that at
the time of the hearing before the Board and subsequently to the decision of
the referee, claimant became connected with a law firm and is now engaged in
the practice of law. He filed for benefits on September 6, 1949. With these
facts in mind the Industrial Commissioner issued an initial determination
disqualifying claimant for benefits upon the ground that he voluntarily left
his employment with John Forsythe Co., Inc., without good cause. Singularly
enough the Board based its decision of the ground that &quot;had claimant been
offered a job as a salesman when unemployed, after his admission to the Bar, he
would have had good cause for refusing such employment since he would not be
fitted by training and experience for such a job offer.&quot; There is no basis
in the record for the quoted statement of the Board. The only employment which
claimant ever had at the time he voluntarily left it was as a salesman with a
haberdashery concern. Had he been discharged from that employment and
consequently involuntarily unemployed, and had the employment service offered
him another job in that industry, he would have to take it or suffer the loss
of his benefits. That was the employment in which he had worked for 6½ years
and was the only employment in which he ever had any experience. The decisions
of the Appeal Board and that of the unemployment insurance referee should be
reversed on the law and the initial determination of the Industrial
Commissioner reinstated without costs. (March 14, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at which the claimant and
representatives of her employer and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, a hotel office manager, filed for benefits on October 4,
1949. She received 22 benefit payments at the $26 rate. In the prior benefit
year she had exhausted her benefits. By initial determination effective April
17, 1950, claimant was ruled ineligible because of unavailability in that she
failed to establish a genuine attachment to the labor market. Claimant has
lived almost all her life in the Catskill Mountain resort area. Her family has
operated a summer resort hotel for many years. Claimant was married in October
1931, and has two children, ages 13 and 8½. From the date of her marriage to
1944, claimant had no employment. Her husband is superintendent of schools in
Fallsburg at a substantial salary. Since returning to the labor market in 1944,
claimant’s only employment has been during the summer resort seasons. In 1944,
when there was a shortage of manpower, claimant was asked to manage the office
of a well-known hotel in the area. She was employed by another hotel at South
Fallsburg and was paid $185 a week to work as office manager. In 1948, she
worked seasonally for the same hotel at $100 a week. In 1949, she received $75
per week during the season from the same employer. Her services were engaged
again for the current season at $100 a week. With this employer she received in
addition to her cash wages, two meals per day. She resides at home with her
husband and two children in an apartment at So. Fallsburg. Her mother resides
with her. Claimant’s duties as office manager include the handling of
correspondence in the making of reservations, the assignment of accommodations,
the computation of bills, etc. She states that she is not related to the
proprietors of either hotel at which she has worked, and that she has no
financial interest therein. Claimant was required by the insurance office to
complete forms indicating her job efforts. On November 30, 1948, claimant
indicated no employer contacts and that she was looking for an willing to take
a hotel office manager’s job. On January 4, 1949, she made a similar
certification. On February 25, 1949, she indicated one employer contact and
that was at the hotel at which she is currently employed. On January 26, 1950,
she indicated that on January 23 and January 24 she made contact with three
hotels in the area, one of which is not open during the winter. She concedes
that these are the only efforts she made to obtain employment in the last two
years and further admits that she made no independent efforts to obtain
employment during the winter months until she was interviewed at the insurance
office and advised that she was expected to seek employment in order to
establish her benefit eligibility. At the hearing, she testified at first that
she had no transportation to surrounding areas where hotels are open in the
winter. Later, she asserted that she that she could arrange transportation
through the use of her husband’s car. She also changed her position as to the
remuneration she sought for winter employment. At first she indicated the
minimum to be between $75 and $100 per week, then later stated that she would
accept $50 if transportation were furnished. When interviewed at the insurance
office, claimant stated that she had not worked winters because the type of
work she does is not obtainable during that time and the hotels that remain
open usually have the same staff all year round. She further asserted that she
has never refused employment at any time during the period when she collected
benefits. It appears that there are at least five hotels in the area which
remain open all year and that from 1200 to 1300 workers are employed during the
winter season with high turnover in staff. It also appears that during the winter
months there are occasional opportunities in the area in selling and clerical
work. Claimant studied stenography and typing at high school but has never done
such work. Prior to her marriage, she was employed in New York City as a
general office clerk for a short period of time. Claimant will not accept any
kind of work if it is not within her actual experience. She is not interested
in any other type of work than as an office manager of a hotel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: While claimant insists
that she has been available for employment at all times during which she
certified for benefits and emphasizes that the employment office never offered
her employment, the merit of her protestations must be judged against the
background of her work history, her domes6tic situation and the labor market of
the area in which she makes her permanent home. Availability is primarily a
subjective criterion measured by the expressions and acts of a claimant that
throw light on his readiness and willingness to be employed (Appeal Board,
10,479-44). It does not lend itself to measurement with precision and legal
certainty. The economic atmosphere of the situation and the credibility and
good faith of the claimant may well be the determinative factors. The claimant
is the wife of a public official with substantial earnings. She is the mother
of two young children. Her normal domestic responsibilities during the winter
season are such as would engross her to the extent of excluding full time
employment unless economic necessity compelled her to genuinely seek work and
make other arrangements in her home. Claimant’s family has been in the hotel
business for many years. During the war period with a manpower shortage,
especially in the non-essential industries, it was natural that claimant was
sought out to ender services to a hotel during the summer season. She has had
substantial wages in such work. She has found this arrangement desirable and
has continued such seasonal employment from 1944 to date. However, this
rendition of services solely in the summer season does not necessarily make
claimant a member of the labor market during the balance of the year. The
salient facts are that from 1931 through 1943, claimant was not a member of the
labor force at all and that since the latter date, she has worked during the
summer seasons only. She worked as a clerk before her marriage. She studied
shorthand and typing at high school. She knows the hotel business well. Despite
these facts, she maintains that she was interested only in an office manager’s
job during the winter months. She made no efforts to seek employment until she
was interviewed and learned that some initiative on her part was expected to
establish her attachment to the labor market. It is significant that on
November 30, 1948, and January 4, 1949, she certified that she had made no
employer contacts; that on February 25, 1949, she listed only her summer
employer. Her credibility is seriously affected by this, since she knew full
well in February 1949, that her summer employer was not open for business
except during the summer season. On January 26, 1950, she listed three
employers to whom she allegedly applied on January 23 and 24. One of these
three is not open in the winter. Although claimant could qualify for work in a
hotel other than as an office manager or as a salesperson or as a clerk and
could revive her skills in shorthand and typing, she indicated definitely that
she was not interested in any kind of work in which she did not have actual
experience. That indication is understandable in a fluid labor market, but
becomes an unreasonable restriction in a limited labor market in a resort area.
Claimant is fitted by training and experience for work other than the specific
job of office manager of a hotel. Yet she insists solely on that employment in
a locality where such opportunities are constricted in the winter season. The
conclusion is inescapable that claimant has made only token efforts to inquire
about employment and only when she was put on notice that her availability was
questioned. Claimant placed upon the employment service the burden of obtaining
employment which meets her restrictions, meanwhile exhausting her benefits each
year. Although at first, claimant raised barriers as to transportation to other
parts of the resort area and also as to the minimum wage she would consider
acceptable, as the hearing progressed, she modified her position and stated she
could arrange transportation and substantially reduced her salary demands. This
change of mind is not impressive. A Referee need not believe everything and
anything that is uncontradicted, especially when it is in the subjective realm.
I find upon all the credible evidence that claimant withdrew from the labor
market upon the conclusion of the summer season and had no intention of seeking
employment or doing anything which would expose her to possible job
opportunities. Further, I am of the opinion that claimant’s attitude towards
unemployment insurance benefits is one of personal aggrandizement rather than to
regard them as stop-gap financial supplementation in periods of unemployment
caused through no fault of the work who is out of a job. This claimant’s
unemployment was not wholly involuntary during the winter months. The Appeal
Board has considered the matter of availability affecting summer resort workers
in several cases. In 6257-41, it said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;The
question in this case is whether claimant was available for employment during
the period in question, within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law.
Claimant contends that, irrespective of the previous period in 1941, during
which she did not care to work, she must be considered available for employment
at the time of her filing because she was ready and able to accept employment
at that time. The position of the local office is that claimant’s past record
and her failure to actively seek employment negates her alleged availability.
It is further argued that her expressed willingness to work springs solely from
her desire to collect unemployment insurance benefits and the fact that she
must fulfill that requirement of the Law in order to be eligible.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;The
referee, in overruling the initial determination, proceeded on the theory that
the record failed to show that claimant would not have been able to go to work
if employment had been offered to her. We cannot agree that the question is so
easily resolved.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

peculiar coincidence of claimant’s having had earnings during two successive
base years in only two calendar quarters and in amounts but slightly over the
minimum required to qualify for benefits, gives added strength to the local
office position. Especially is this fact significant in view of the close
relationship between claimant and the employer, which would indicate that her
periods of work and of benefits were purely matters of choice on her
part.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

where a claimant has had no work during off seasons, it is not sufficient of
itself to support a determination of unavailability (Appeal Board, 9155-43).
However, the record herein discloses that the claimant considered herself a
‘summer season worker’ and admittedly never did work during any other season of
the year. Her registration with the private employment agency was restricted to
summer job offers; her refusal of the agency’s offer of winter employment as a
cook and her lack of any employment during the greater part of each year for
twenty years is indicative of her lack of desire for work after each summer
season. Claimant’s entire course of conduct leads to the conclusion, that she
had limited her periods of availability for employment to the summer months
with no intention to work at any other time of the year.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘involuntary unemployment,’ which, having become a subject of general interest
and concern, called the statute forth in order ‘to prevent its spread and to
lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the
unemployed worker and his family’ and that, it was considered that the
statutory plan of compulsory unemployment insurance could better solve the
problem then as ‘now handled by the barren actualities of poor relief
assistance backed by compulsory contribution through taxation.’ To attain this
end ‘for the public good and the well-being of the wage earners’ the statutory
machinery was set up ‘for the compulsory setting aside of financial reserves
for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.&quot;

that is shown as to claimant’s ownership, influence in, and connection with his
aforesaid corporate enterprises, during the past 13 years, it is at least
fairly inferable that such was the cause of his seasonable employment. Thus
there is an element of voluntariness on his part in the precipitation of the
predicament of his unemployed periods. This element produces a reaction which
seems beyond the intended reach of the statute in the light of the evidence
presented, or at least it was within the province of the Board to so conclude.
From all that appears it is also inferable that his remuneration is, to some
extent at least, referable to some supervisory, managerial or caretaking
service throughout the part of the year the hotel is closed. Up to five years ago
claimant resided in New York City while the hotel was closed and there he
obtained some work. Since 1938, when unemployment insurance benefits first
became payable, he and his family have dwelt in Monticello and during the
vacant hotel period has done no other work. During these periods the evidence
indicates that his efforts to obtain work in the city were desultory and
seemingly half hearted. To qualify as one whom the act was designed to assist,
in countering the public evil of economic insecurity, it was incumbent upon
claimant to show that, for the period he claims the benefits, he was totally
unemployed in that he had met with a total lack of any employment, including
that not subject to the statute, and that all this came upon him through no
fault or intended act of his own and that it was in truth and in fact the
result of his inability to obtain any appropriate employment notwithstanding
that he was capable and available therefor. (Labor Law, formerly Sec 502, subd.
10, new Sec. 522) The Board has found upon all the evidence that claimant has
failed to establish these qualifications; that during the periods for which he
has filed for benefits he was ‘not genuinely in the labor market’.&quot;
&quot;Substantial evidence supports the finding, and the decision appealed from
should be affirmed, with costs to the Industrial Commissioner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

incumbent upon such claimant to manifest a continued attachment to the labor
market. This must be demonstrated by&nbsp;<u>bona fide</u>, diligent and
sincere efforts after the summer season to obtain employment in keeping with
the claimant’s employment history, his training and experience and the labor

the Appeal Board and Court decisions, quoted by the Referee, were rendered may

standing. Yet, in rendering initial determinations, there is sometimes a
hesitancy in resorting to a reasoning which is not based on concrete readily
available facts, but which requires inferences or the drawing of conclusions
from surrounding circumstances. Many cases cannot satisfactorily be resolved
without such reasoning. It is true, of course, that it is more difficult to
reach sound conclusions when secondary factors must be evaluated than to arrive
at determinations on the basis of clear and precise facts. However,

foreman for a packing company in Brooklyn, New York at a salary of $84 per
week. After being laid off in January 1949 because of a reduction in
supervisory personnel, he sought work in New York, but could not find any. He
returned with his family to his former home in Glen Lyon, Pennsylvania, on
February 8, 1949 and re-established his permanent residence there. Claimant
filed an inter-state claim for benefits in Pennsylvania and registered at the
local State employment office on February 9, 1949. On March 23, 1949 he
obtained employment in a factory in a nearby town of Berick, Pennsylvania, as a
shear helper at the rate of $80 per week. He was laid off from this job for
lack of work on June 21, 1949. Thereafter, he filed an additional claim in
Pennsylvania and continued to seek work in the area. On November 14, 1949
claimant started a course of training in a barber school in Wilkes Barre,
Pennsylvania under the G.I. Bill of Rights and applied for and received
subsistence allowances. He attended the school during the hours 3 p.m. to 10
p.m. on five days a week. Claimant certified that he was looking for work while
attending school and could change his school hours so as not to interfere with
work and, if necessary, would leave school to accept work. The Pennsylvania
office certified that claimant could attend school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. or from
3 p.m. to 10 p.m., that he was willing to leave school or change classes to
accept temporary or permanent employment, that he had personally applied for
work, including that of a laborer, in several local establishments and filed
applications for any type of work available. An initial determination was
issued on January 13, 1950 disqualifying claimant from benefits effective
November 16, 1959 for unavailability for employment for the reason that
&quot;no credence can be placed in your statement that your hours can be
changed to permit your accepting employment during normal daytime working
hours.&quot; Claimant protested and requested a hearing. He continued to report
to January 2, 1950 and sought employment. On February 6, 1950 he found work at
a colliery in Wilkes Barre, where he is still employed. His hours of work are 2
p.m. to 9:30 p.m. His school hours were always flexible and were changed to 8
a.m. to 1 p.m.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for employment because he failed to exercise due diligence in seeking work and
was attending school during the regular business hours. We are unable to agree
with the referee’s conclusion. At no time in this proceeding was it contended
or questioned that claimant was not diligently seeking work and was period
involved. The ground for disqualification was that claimant was attending
school during normal working hours and that no credence could be placed in his
statement that his school hours could be changed to permit him to accept
employment. The best proof of the credibility of such statement is that
claimant did obtain full-time employment in February 1950 and was permitted to
change his school hours so as not to interfere with such employment. Moreover,
claimant consistently maintained that he would leave school, if necessary, in
order to accept employment. Claimant placed on restrictions on his
employability, either as to the location of the work, the type of work or the
rate of wage. There is no reason to doubt claimant’s statement that in view of
his obligation to support his family he would discontinue his attendance at the
trade school if he obtained work which would have compelled him to do so. Under
all the circumstances herein, we hold that claimant has demonstrated by his
course of conduct that he was available for employment during the period in
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

such a situation presents itself, it is, of course, necessary to probe closely
into the facts. School attendance during customary working hours is strong
evidence of unavailability. To overcome such evidence, it must be shown and verified
that the school hours can be adjusted or that the claimant would be willing to
abandon school attendance. In addition, consideration should be given to the
general conduct of the claimant and his attitude and efforts. Independent
diligent search for work, absence of undue restrictions, reasonable
opportunities to secure employment and other factors showing that the claimant
subordinates school attendance to employment, are elements which will tend to
overcome such evidence of claimant’s unavailability. On the other hand, there
are factors which would strengthen that evidence. Among them are these:
Claimant paid a substantial tuition fee, particularly if the fee would be
forfeited. Long and intensive courses of study, leading to a degree, license, etc.,
are involved which make it unlikely that claimant would be willing to forego
completion of his studies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

original claim for benefits on June 2, 1949. She reported regularly until
August 23. She was due to report at the placement office on August 29 and at
the insurance office on August 30, but failed to do so because she had left New
York City on August 25 or 26 for a week’s vacation. She returned to New York on
Friday, September 2. On Tuesday, September 6 claimant reported at the
employment office. On that day she was referred to employment in her line with
a union establishment at the prevailing wage rate for her occupation. She
failed to report to the employer. On September 7, 1949 claimant reported at the
local office and was interviewed. Claimant requested credit for the period
during which she failed to report. A notation was made on the claimant’s record
to the effect that her failure to report on August 30 was not excused and her
benefit rights were suspended effective August 25 on the ground that she was
out of town. Some discussion followed as to her right to have her claim of
September 7 predated, as a result of which her claim was reinstated effective
September 6, 1949, the date on which she reported to the employment office.
Notice of claimant’s failure to report to the prospective employer on September
6 was received by the local office on September 8. On September 13 an initial
determination was issued disqualifying claimant effective September 6, 1949 for

offer of suitable employment on September 6, 1949. He ruled, however, that
since she was not &quot;in benefits&quot; on the date, the local office could
not impose the disqualification against her for her refusal of employment, and
he accordingly overruled the initial determination. It was argued before him on
behalf of claimant that the predating of her claim for September 7 to September
6 so as to support the initial determination effective September 6 was contrary
to procedure and to specific instructions contained in the information booklet
issued to all claimants. Passing on that phase of the case, the referee said
that the insurance office had the power to excuse a claimant’s failure to
report but in the instant case did not do so; that when claimant failed to
report on August 30 she became ineligible until she next reported to the
insurance office and refiled her claim. He stated further; &quot;She could not
satisfy the requirements of reporting to the insurance office by reporting to
the employment office (<u>Matter of McGowan</u>, 226 App. Div. 933, reversing
Appeal Board, 8850-43.) If the insurance office excused claimant’s failure to
report it would have to be retroactive to the date of her failure to report. It
may not be done for only part of the period. Accordingly, I find that the
insurance office was without power to predate claimant’s refiling to September
6 and it should have been effective September 7.&quot; The Industrial
Commissioner points out that although the booklets furnished to claimants set
forth that reporting at the employment office does not satisfy the requirement
to report to the insurance office, nevertheless a failure to file a claim may
be excused by the Commissioner upon the claimant’s presentation of reasons
deemed by him to be good cause. It is urged that the local office in passing on
claimant’s request for credit for the period from August 25 to September 7,
determined in its discretion that claimant was entitled to a refiling as of the
date she reported at the placement office. The official records of the local
office bear this out. The question presented to us, therefore, is whether or
not the claimant may successfully challenge the determination of the local
office predating her claim from September 7 to September 6. We cannot say that
such predating was allowed on September 7 for the specific purpose of enabling
the local office to disqualify claimant as of September 6. The record shows
that notice of the refusal was not received in the local office until September
8. We cannot agree with the referee that the local office was without the power
to excuse claimant’s failure to report for only part of the period in question
and predate the refiling to September 6, as it did. Nor can we agree that such
action was arbitrary or an abuse of its discretion. We believe that the
Commissioner or his agents are vested with wide powers to excuse the failure to
comply with its registration and reporting regulations and we have consistently
refrained from disturbing such acts when a reasonable basis exists therefor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

November 9, 1949. The local office issued an initial determination holding that
claimant was unavailable for employment from November 9, 1949 to January 1,
1950 and that he was overpaid $156 in benefits. The basis for the determination
was that claimant was engaged in self-employment. Claimant worked from November
1942 to January 6, 1949 as a time study engineer for a chain company earning
$450 a month. He was laid off from this employment. In October 1945, claimant
acquired a half interest in a mat manufacturing business from the sole
proprietor for the sum of $250. He entered into partnership agreement with the
proprietor whereby he was to receive 60 cents an hour for the time devoted to
manufacturing mats and one-half of the profits of the business. During the
period that claimant was employed as a time study engineer, he worked evenings,
Saturdays and Sundays in this venture. During claimant’s reporting period he
devoted all of his time to the partnership business. He spent 200 working hours
in October 1949, 156 hours in November 1949 and 171 in December 1949. For the
month of November 1949, he received $82.24 and in December 1949 $285.75
representing compensation for hours of work and his share of the profits. The
volume of orders for November 1949 amounted to $802.36 and for December 1949
the sum of $339.49. He solicited orders from prospective customers; he cut
tires, punched strips, assembled and closed mats and disposed of the strips. On
January 6, 1950, claimant obtained employment as a salesman for an automobile
agency. E continued to devote some time to his side venture despite his
full-time employment. Claimant stated that he was at all times ready, willing
and able to accept full-time employment in which event he would work in the mat
business evenings and weekends and even hire somebody to work in the plant if
found necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and that his activities in connection therewith in no way interfered with his

conclusion that claimant would have accepted full-time employment had it been
offered to him, nevertheless it clearly appears that situation does not differ
from that of any other person who has full time employment but is willing to
abandon such employment for more remunerative pursuits. Under the circumstances
herein, it cannot be said that claimant, while devoting his full-time to the
business of the partnership was in fact available for employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     Law. Consequently, a self-employed claimant, whatever the intensity and
     other circumstances of his self-employment, would meet the test of &quot;total
     lack of any employment&quot; of Section 522 of the Law. That distinguishes
     him from a claimant who has employment as an employee. Such claimant does
     not meet this test on any day on which he is so employed, however short

is no hard and fast rule by which it can be measured whether a self-employed
individual would be &quot;available for work&quot; in a manner that satisfies
the statutory requirement. Several Appeal Board decisions on this point have
been rendered. In case #12,622-46, the Board held that self-employment which
requires continuous attention removes the claimant from the labor market (Index
No. 725H-10). It is of interest, however, that the Board in that decision
emphasized the fact that &quot;the record fails to show any efforts on his (the
claimant’s) part to seek employment during the hours he devotes to the practice
of his profession.&quot; The claimant was a dentist and professed to seek night
work. It is also of interest that the Board in that decision quoted from Case
#5768-41 as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

test in these situations is not the amount of income. The test is whether the
enterprise is of such a nature that requires the continuous attention of the
claimant and thus removes him from the labor market. In accordance with this
test, we have held that real estate brokers who rent offices and assume
obligations with a view of building up permanent business have removed
themselves from the labor market (Appeal Board, 4763-41; 804-39). So too in the
case of an accountant who entered an enterprise under similar circumstances
(Appeal Board, 2488-40); dental mechanic (Appeal Board, 3629-40); attorney
(Appeal Board, 4446-40; 1793-39). We have held such claimants ineligible for
benefits, even though their enterprises yielded no income whatsoever, on the
ground that they were unavailable for employment.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

against this decision, there are other cases where the Board held a self-employed
claimant to be available for work. This includes the case of an attorney who
devoted &quot;only his spare time to his law office in an effort to supplement
his income&quot; and who was &quot;at all times available for work during the
usual daytime hours&quot; (Case #12,844-46; Index No. 725H-11). It includes the
case of a claimant whose &quot;activities as a real estate salesman were merely
intended as a ‘side line’ during his reporting period&quot; and which
&quot;would not have prevented him from accepting suitable full-time employment
had it been offered to him.&quot; (Case #13,127-46; Index No. 725H-12). It also
includes Case #14,660-47, dealing with a claimant who undertook the sale of
junk, which shows language, such as this: &quot;Claimant undertook the sale of
junk as a side line to partially tide him over his period of unemployment. He
did not do so with the intention of establishing a permanent business or
devoting all of his time to these activities as a sole means of a
livelihood.&quot; And further; &quot;He would have willingly abandoned such
activities and accepted an offer of employment for which he was fitted.&quot;

not quite apparent whether the principles now enunciated in Case #23,493-50 are
superimposed on those laid down in previous decisions, or merely supplement
them. This doubt stems mainly from the fact that the Board in its former
decisions utilized the willingness to abandon the self-employment, evaluated in
the light of the circumstances of the case, as an important, and possibly in
the last analysis as the decisive, test. Even in the first mentioned case, that
of the dentist to whom benefits were denied, the Board considered it essential
to point to the lack of a showing that claimant was interested in work as an
employee &quot;during the hours he devotes to the practice of his
profession.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the instant case, the Board referred to the claimant’s statement that he was
&quot;at all times ready, willing and able to accept full-time employment in
which event he would work in the mat business (claimant’s self-employment)
evenings or weekends and even hire somebody to work in the plant if found
necessary.&quot; In other words, the claimant was held to be unavailable in
spite of the fact that he would have abandoned his self-employment and accepted
a job for the very same hours which he devoted to his self-employment. As a
matter of fact, claimant obtained employment on January 6, 1950. He was,
nevertheless, held to be unavailable for the period from November 9, 1949, when
he fled his claim, until January 1, 1950, and to be overpaid in the amount of
$156 which he had received as benefits during that period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     "Times New Roman"'>All of this is an indication of a sterner attitude
     towards self-employment as reflecting unavailability than has been shown
     in the past. It seems proper to conclude that the decision in case
     #23,493-50 stands for the principle that a claimant is not eligible for
     benefits regarding periods during which he devotes a substantial portion
     of his time to self-employment, irrespective of his prior work history and
     regardless of his willingness to abandon the self-employment in order to
     accept work as an employee<o:p></o:p></span></li>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at which claimant and
representatives of the claimant’s former employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a radio operator on a ship,
filed for benefits on December 9, 1949. By initial determination effective the
same day, he was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of employment
without good cause. Claimant had sailed for the China Coast on June 22, 1949,
and returned on December 7, 1949. The ship was due to make another foreign
voyage. The claimant did not re-sign articles. When interviewed at the
insurance office, claimant stated that he did not re-sign articles because he
had personal business to take care of. He reiterated this reason when
requesting a hearing. At the hearing, however, the claimant stated that his
real reason for not re-signing articles was that he believed that the ship was
bound for the China waters. He testified that it was common knowledge that a
trip would be made to that area. He further stated that he saw cargo being
loaded on the ship which indicated that the destination was Shanghai. According
to the employer, the vessel left New York on December 9 and docked at
Alexandria, Columbo, Singapore, Manila and subsequently, Korean and Japanese
ports, thence to the West Coast of the United States, through the Panama Canal
to New York. The employer’s representative could not state whether the ship’s
original destination was to China waters. He conceded that many times there is
a change in the itinerary as to the ports for which the ship is bound. Claimant
contended that he was justified in leaving the vessel and not re-signing
articles, because the ship was found for a dangerous zone, and he did not ask
for a leave-off, because he did not want it known what his reasons were.
Claimant pointed out that on the prior voyage his ship had been detained by the
Chinese Communists, and that no incidents occurred after the ship sailed, and
that in all probability, that resulted in the change of itinerary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evidence, I find that the claimant was justified in leaving his employment. It
appears to me that the original destination of the ship was to dangerous China

His leaving of employment was, therefore, with good cause. The initial
determination is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a secretary-stenographer, with
approximately five years experience was last employed in her customary
occupation at $52 per week. Prior thereto, claimant worked for several other
employers in a similar capacity. On January 31, 1950, claimant was offered
employment, allegedly as a secretary, at $45 weekly. The hours involved were 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and in addition every third Saturday she would have been
required to work from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Claimant refused such employment
primarily because she deemed the salary insufficient and because of her
objection to Saturday work. Claimant restricted herself to employment as a
secretary in the hotel industry. She was unwilling to accept less than $50
weekly. Claimant’s prior experience, although consisting principally of hotel
work, was not exclusively in that field. Claimant’s last employment of a
permanent nature terminated on October 7, 1949. Except for a temporary period
of approximately one month in or about January 1950, she has had no other work
since that date. Approximately five months prior to the hearing before the
Board, claimant, concededly withdrew from the labor market. Based upon claimant’s
refusal of employment, the local office made an initial determination
disqualifying her from receiving benefits upon the ground that such refusal was
without good cause. Claimant requested a hearing and the referee overruled the
initial determination of the local office. The Industrial Commissioner
thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination of the local office, concluded that the proffered employment was
at a rate substantially less favorable than the wages prevailing in the
locality for similar work. We are not completely in accord with the referee’s
disposition of this case. Claimant’s proper job classification is somewhat
obscure in light of the evidence adduced. Moreover, the accurate job title of
the proffered employment is likewise not clear. Consequently, difficulty is
experienced in arriving at a definite conclusion as to the suitability of the
job offer in question. While we entertain some reservation as to the propriety
of the terms and conditions of the proffered employment, we cannot overlook
claimant’s long period of unemployment in an apparently active labor market. We
believe that her entire course of conduct and utter lack of due diligence in
search of employment, over a considerable period of time, rendered claimant
unavailable for employment. Concededly, she was not an active members of the
labor force within the five or six month period immediately preceding the Board
hearing. Her efforts to seek employment prior thereto were sporadic, indicating
a tenuous attachment to the labor market. We believe claimant’s refusal of the
offer of employment was further indication of her unavailability for work. Upon
all the facts and circumstances herein, we are persuaded that claimant was not
available for work. Consequently, the proper initial determination in this case
is unavailability for employment rather than disqualification for job refusal
without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

original claim for benefits on November 5, 1948. He had last worked as a fee
collector in a city park. During the three weeks preceding Christmas claimant
obtained employment as a floorwalker in a department store and worked three
evenings each week. During this period he reported such employment and filed
several additional applications for benefits. A question arose as to whether
claimant could not have worked full time during the pre-Christmas weeks had he
desired and an initial determination was issued by the local office holding him
ineligible for benefits because of unavailability on December 15, 17 and 22.
The basis for this was that work was available to claimant on these days and he
failed to work. Claimant denied this, stating that full-time work had been
refused him during those weeks. In the course of interviewing claimant on the
above determination he was questioned concerning his efforts to find
employment. He had previously stated that he expected to obtain employment with
the city or the county. On February 2 he stated that he did not wish to make a
statement as to the contacts he made for work but was willing to report to the
employment office every day to make any contacts for work that they suggested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>He stated also that he
had been interviewed for a position. On February 9 the local office mailed to
claimant a form 337 which contained blank spaces for the listing of employers
contacted for work and requested that claimant fill out the form. Claimant
filled out the form but did not list employers contacted for work. He stated
that he was looking for and willing to take work as an interviewer, paying and
receiving teller, claims examiner, inspector, clerk, interpreter, etc. Under
&quot;Remarks&quot; he stated: &quot;Due to the true fact that the persons I
have contacted for employment are persons of highest esteem and reputation, I
must withhold the information.&quot; On February 16 the local office issued an
initial determination ruling claimant ineligible for benefits, effective
February 16, 1949 because of unavailability for employment based upon
&quot;Your refusal to complete form 337 or give definite information on your
effort to find employment.&quot; On February 23 claimant filled out another
form 337 on which he stated &quot;I am willing to go to your employment office
any time you wish.&quot; On the same day he stated that he had been assured of
work with the municipality and repeated that he was available for work at all
times. Claimant continued to report as required. He was next interviewed on
March 9 at which time he stated that he had contacted a certain employer since
his previous visit and others which he did not want to mention and also that he
looked in the newspapers every day. On March 16 claimant filled out another
form 337 in which he listed a few employers whom he had contacted on March 12
and thereafter. On the basis of this form claimant was reinstated in benefits
by the local office as of March 16, 1949. Claimant remained in good standing
thereafter until he obtains employment on May 1, 1949 as a fee collector in a

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee overruled the initial
determination of the local office ruling claimant unavailable for employment
during the pre-Christmas weeks and this issue is not now before us. The only
question is claimant’s availability for employment during the period February
16 to March 15, 1949. As to this, the referee ruled claimant unavailable,
stating that he was not convinced that claimant had made contacts for
employment during this period and that claimant was spending his time making
contacts toward the job which he obtained in May 1949. He added that claimant
had unreasonably restricted his availability for employment by being interested
only in one job. We are unable to accept the referee’s conclusions on this
issue. In the first place, the determination of unavailability was not based on
the charge that claimant failed to contact employers, but solely on the ground
that he refused to disclose the details of his contacts. It was not contended
before the referee that this reflected in nay way on the question of claimant’s
willingness to work. While we recognize that it was a subject of proper
inquiry, it does not follow that claimant’s refusal to give all the information
requested is a sufficient basis in itself for a holding of unavailability for
employment. Claimant insisted throughout his reporting period, and there is no
reason to doubt, that he wanted to work and was making independent efforts in
that direction. If he exerted his greatest efforts towards obtaining the job in
the city park, it hardly follows that he was unreasonably restricting his
availability by doing so since it appears that this was the work which he had the
best chance of obtaining. On the basis of all the evidence in this case we find
that there is insufficient support for the determination that claimant was
unavailable for employment from February 16 to March 15, 1949. Certainly, there
is nothing to indicate that his circumstances or his attitude towards work
differed during that period from that during the period for which the local
office authorized the payment of benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Appeal by the
Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board which determined the claimant available for unemployment insurance
benefits. Under the provisions of Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor Law,
Article 18) the Industrial Commissioner has the statutory delegation of power
to prescribe the manner of filing of claims, notification of unemployment and
reports on the existence and continuance of the unemployment of a claimant to
benefits under the statute. (sects. 591, par. 1; 596, APRs. 1 and 2). The
Commissioner has prescribed that claimants shall show in detail prospective
employers contacted, giving precise data. During the period in controversy
here, from February 16, 1949 to March 16, 1949, the claimant refused to answer
questions directed to this subject in a form prescribed by the Commissioner, or
to answer similar questions on an oral interview at the local office. The
claimant stated in the form that &quot;due to the true fact that the persons I
have contacted are persons of high esteem and reputation I must withhold the
information&quot; and he later said to an interviewer that this information was
a &quot;personal matter&quot;. The question is directed to the good faith of
the claim for unemployment insurance. The Commissioner is entitled to have
answers to such questions which are reasonably within the scope of the
authority delegated to him. A fair reading of the statute indicates that if the
information is refused &quot;effective days&quot; which are the statutory bases
of benefits, need not be calculated during the period of such refusal, and that
there is, therefore, no availability for employment during such a period. The
determination of the appeal Board is reversed, on the law, and the claim
disallowed during the period in controversy, without costs. (November 15, 1950)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in following the issue as set forth in the initial determination, stated that
under the circumstances of the case here discussed &quot;there is no
availability for employment&quot;, the result could also have been rationalized
on the basis of a failure to comply with reporting requirements. As a matter of
fact, an alternate determination to his effect was made when the case was
argued before the Appeal Board on a reopening. A claimant who fails to report
as required will, under existing Regulations, not be credited with days of
unemployment intervening between the date of such failure and the date he,
thereafter, reports in accordance with requirements. The Court recognized that
the Industrial Commissioner &quot;is entitled to have answers to such questions
which are reasonably within the scope of the authority delegated to him&quot;.
Consequently, the claimant did not report in accordance with reasonable
requirements and his failure to comply can be considered in the same light as
if he had not appeared at all in the local office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Mention is made of this
line of reasoning because a finding of ineligibility on the basis of failure to
comply with registration or reporting requirements is, as a rule, simple and direct.
Such failure can be ascertained with considerably greater ease than elements,
such as unavailability, which are only established as a conclusion drawn by
inference from the claimant’s acts or actions. Drawing of such conclusions is
often a matter of judgment and opinion. They are subject to challenge and some
degrees of uncertainty. Hardly any of these disadvantages attach to findings of
a failure to comply with reporting requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant filed a claim for benefits on
November 7,1949. By initial determination effective the same date, she was
disqualified for 42 days because of voluntary leaving of employment. Claimant
was employed for approximately two years to October 21 as a full-charge
bookkeeper and last received $60 per week. She was laid off from this
employment. She secured other employment at $50 starting November 1 through a
newspaper advertisement. The advertisement called for an assistant bookkeeper
with knowledge of accounts payable, monitor board operations, and typing. She
was interviewed by the employer and was given a general description of the
duties. Payroll work was not mentioned at the time and she had never done that
kind of work. On November 3 claimant was asked to do the payroll work in
connection with the records of the 75 to 80 persons then employed by the
establishment. The work was continuous and caused claimant to have a severe
eyestrain. She had never done payroll work before. For these reasons, she
notified the employer on the morning of November 4 that she intended to leave.
She left the employment at the close of that working day. Claimant secured
other employment on November 27 as an assistant bookkeeper, not requiring
payroll work. Her starting salary was $50 and at the end of one week the salary
was raised to $55.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

20 percent of claimant’s working time. The Board is of the opinion that the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant had
previously been employed as a Full Charge Bookkeeper at $60.00 a week. She took
a position as Assistant Bookkeeper at $50.00 a week. She was told that her
duties would consist of handling accounts payable, monitor board, relief duty
on the switch board and typing. After she had gone to work she learned for the
first time that she would also be required to devote a day a week to work on
the payroll. She had had no payroll experience and although she did the work
satisfactorily to her employer, she found it distasteful to her and hard on her
eyes and thereupon left the employment and filed her claim for benefits. The
record indicates that the wages paid were those prevailing for similar work in
the locality and that the duties of the position customarily included work on
the payroll. There can be no question but that the claimant, who had been a
bookkeeper for some eighteen years, was properly fitted by training and
experience to do this job. To make a distinction for the purpose of
unemployment insurance benefits between general bookkeeping duties and bookkeeping
duties which include payroll work draws too fine a line. We are of the opinion
that claimant’s voluntary separation from her employment because she was
required to post some payroll figures was without good cause, as a matter of
law, and disqualified her from unemployment insurance benefits pursuant to
Section 593 of the Labor Law. The decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board is reversed on the law and the determination of the Industrial
Commissioner reinstated, without costs. (Dated November 29, 1950)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not indicated in their decisions, the Referee and the Appeal Board in

fact that the job which claimant left was that of an assistant bookkeeper at

bookkeeper at $60. The Court decision does not make direct reference to
claimant’s higher skill as a full-charge bookkeeper. Nevertheless, it is
significant that they found claimant to be &quot;properly fitted by training

may have less weight on voluntary leaving issues even though the accepted
employment of lesser skill is held for only a few days. (See A.B. 13,906-46;

benefits on June 27, 1949. Thereafter, she reported regularly at the local
office. On September 22, 1949, an initial determination was issued, effective
September 12, 1949, holding claimant ineligible for benefits upon the ground
that she was unavailable for employment. The basis for such initial
determination was an interview with the claimant at the local office on
September 12, 1949. Said interview was reduced to writing and subscribed by the
claimant. For a few years prior to the birth of her child, claimant was
employed on a full-time basis with a stock brokerage firm. Subsequently, she
was unable to arrange for her child's care during normal working hours and
accordingly arranged to work part-time. From September 17, 1948 to May 19,
1949, claimant pursued a schedule which required her to work approximately 4:00
p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and on Thursday from about
noon to approximately 8:00 p.m. On Friday, she worked a full day during the
normal business hours. This work schedule was imperative because claimant's
husband was also gainfully employed. He was available to take care of the
infant child during the above hours. Following termination of such employment,
claimant sought similar part-time work by examining newspaper advertisements,
reporting regularly at the employment service as required and by registering
with several private employment agencies. She also attempted to procure work as
a salesclerk in the local department stores in the vicinity in which she
resided. Claimant was unsuccessful in obtaining employment during the hours to
which she restricted her availability. Claimant was classified by the
employment service as a dictaphone operator and given a deferred code. Such
coding is customarily applied to applicants possessing qualifications rarely
sought by prospective employers. The employment office at no time registered
the claimant nor was any record ever made of the restrictions imposed by her.
Such restrictions were revealed for the first time when claimant was
interviewed at the local office, on September 22, 1949. She became re-employed
for a few days starting February 17, 1950. Based upon disclosures made at the
above interview, the local office issued the initial determination herein.
Claimant requested a hearing and the referee overruled the initial
determination of the local office. The Industrial Commissioner thereupon
appealed to this Board. At the hearing before the Board, the Industrial
Commissioner made application to amend the initial determination to the extent
of revising the effective date thereof by fixing the same as of June 27, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination of the local office, concluded that opportunities for employment
did not exist during the hours to which claimant restricted her employment. We
do not subscribe to this view. In our opinion, restrictions imposed by claimant
constituted an effective barrier to employment. The most convincing evidence in
this respect is her long period of unemployment, during which she
unsuccessfully sought work meeting the restrictions imposed by her, despite her
apparent effort in search of a position. Part-time clerical work was, for al
practical purposes non-existent during the hours claimant desired. Her
limitations to sales work in the immediate vicinity of her residence, during
the hours she made herself available, in effect, rendered possibility of
employment nil. However, prior to September 22, 1949, there was no evidence
whatsoever as to claimant's unwillingness or inability to accept employment
under existing conditions. As of that date, it appears that her restrictions as
to hours and locality rendered her virtually unavailable. On September 22,
1949, there was evidence for the first time tending to establish claimant's
unavailability (<u>Matter of Salavarria</u>, 266 App. Div. 922, affirming
Appeal Board 7831-42). Upon all the facts and circumstances herein, we are
persuaded that claimant was unavailable for employment effective September 22,
1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

such cases is the question whether reasonable opportunities exist to secure

representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testimony was
taken. Claimant, a stenographer, filed for benefits on June 9, 1949. An initial
determination disqualified her effective August 3 for refusal of employment and
ruled her ineligible effective August 3 for unavailability. Claimant was last
employed, at the time in issue, as a stenographer with an Engineering Company
in New York City to July 9, 1948, at $190 a month. Prior to that she had been
employed as a stenographer in a law office. She is married and has a child one
year of age. She lives with her mother who takes care of her child. Claimant
has been employed since October 21 as a secretary with an employer located in
New York City at $40 a week. She obtained this job through a private employment
agency. Prior to that she had worked for three weeks at a bank in Lynbrook as a
stenographer and teller trainee. On August 3 the claimant was offered
employment as a typist-clerk with an employer in Valley Stream at $40 a week, a
wage above that prevailing in the locality for similar employment. It was an
unusual wage for that work. The claimant refused the job because she desired to
obtain employment as a stenographer. The employment interviewer conceded that
the work of a typist utilizes a skill lower than that of a stenographer and
that continued work as a typist would cause a deterioration of the claimant's
’kill as a stenographer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board granting benefits to respondent. By its decision the Board has determined
that respondent’s refusal of an offer of employment was legally justified.
Respondent’s last previous employment as a stenographer. The offer refused was
as a typist-clerk at a wage found to be above the prevailing wage of either
typist-clerks or stenographers. The respondent’s objection to the offered
employment was that she preferred work as a stenographer. There is no evidence
that respondent was not reasonably fitted by training and experience for the
offered employment. All of the requirements of the statute were met and the
refusal of the offer was without just cause. (<u>Matter of Heater</u>&nbsp;(Corsi)

It is therefore of importance to note that the Court found &quot;no evidence

satisfied those prevailing for either typist-clerks or stenographers and
concluded that &quot;all of the requirements of the statute were met.&quot; The

attaches to the finding that the offered wages corresponded not only to those

reemphasizes the holdings of the same Court in other cases to the effect that
fine distinctions are improper in establishing whether a claimant is

that standards should be applied which are broader than those sometimes

such a case has &quot;good cause&quot; on general grounds to refuse the
employment, is a different question. It does not seem likely that a refusal
could be justified because the wages, although prevailing for the refused job

for a different job, requiring a higher skill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Yet, such a conclusion
is not a complete answer. There remains the question whether the claimant had
&quot;good cause&quot; under the general provisions of the statute. The
relationship of the general &quot;good cause&quot; clause to the special
provisions, such as those dealing with prevailing wages, is this: If the
conditions of the special provisions are met, this means that the claimant had
good cause as a matter of law by virtue of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of
Section 593 subd. 2, without power vested in the Commissioner of exercising any
discretion or judgment. If the conditions which are claimed to represent good
cause are not covered by the specific provisions in these paragraphs, the
finding whether there is good cause is a matter of judgment resting with the
Industrial Commissioner. Such judgment is usually exercised by evaluating the
claimant’s action by that of a reasonably prudent person who is genuinely
seeking employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the instant case, and assuming that the offered wage had not been
commensurate with those of a stenographer, this question would present itself;
Would the claimant, if acting as a reasonably prudent person genuinely
interested in a job, have refused the employment because of the offered wage
level?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

operator with many years of experience. He was continuously employed for 17
years ending June 22, 1949 by a single employer. Prior to that he had been
employed for 15 years in a different establishment. On June 22, claimant was
temporarily laid off because of the slack season. On June 23, 1949, claimant
filed an application for benefits and registered for employment in the City of
New York. At the time of his registration claimant advised the local office
that he lost his wife in November 1948 and that he desired to visit Baltimore
to reside temporarily with a married daughter during the period of his
unemployment. He asked for permission to maintain his registration in New York
and to report by mail from Baltimore. The local office denied claimant permission
to report from without the state but advised him to file an original claim in
Baltimore under the Interstate Benefit Plan. On June 24, 1949, claimant left
the City of New York for Baltimore. On June 30, 1949, claimant filed a claim
for benefits and registered for employment in the City of Baltimore under the
Inter-state Benefit Plan. He thereafter reported for insurance benefits and for
employment on July 7, 14 and 21. At the time of his registration, the claims
taker discussed possibilities for employment in the City of Baltimore and he
advised claimant that the garment industry in the City of Baltimore was under
going a seasonal slack period. The claims taker deemed claimant available far
employment. Prior to leaving New York City for Baltimore, claimant advised, his
employer of his intention to reside temporarily in Baltimore. He left his
temporary address in Baltimore with his employer, asking that he be notified
when work was available. Throughout the period of his stay in Baltimore
claimant was at all times ready, able and willing to accept employment if any
were offered to him. He was also at all times ready to return to New York for
employment if recalled either by his employer or by the New York State
Employment Service. on July 20 , 1949, claimant was notified by his employer
that work would be resumed in his establishment on July 25, 1949. Claimant
returned to New York City on July 24, 1949 and resumed work the next day. The
City of Baltimore has a population of about 942,000. The annual production of
the garment industry and accessories aggregates about $108,800,000. The annual
production of women's coats, suits and skirts is valued at $8,900,000 and the
annual production of women's dresses is valued at $4,100,000. on August 10,
1949, after an interview at the local office, an initial determination was
issued holding that claimant was unavailable for employment beginning June 24,
1949. Claimant contested the initial determination and requested a hearing. The
referee sustained the initial determination and claimant appealed to this
Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole issue on this appeal is whether or
not claimant is available for employment. In Appeal Board, 2065-40, we defined
availability as &quot;the claimant's readiness, willingness and ability to
perform work for which she is reasonably fitted&quot;. It is not contended that
claimant, in this case, is physically incapable of performing the work.
Therefore, the test of claimant's availability is his state of mind of being
ready and willing to accept employment when offered. Claimant's state of mind
can be judged from his expression and his conduct. Claimant did not quit a job
to go to Baltimore. At the time he went to that city, he was in a period of
unemployment caused by the arrival of the slack season in the garment industry
in the City of New York. He did not go to Baltimore for a vacation. Baltimore
is not a vacation resort. Claimant lost his wife shortly before the period in
issue and it is quite understandable that he desired to spend the period of his
forced idleness in New York with members of his family who were then located in
the City of Baltimore. He made arrangements for return as soon as work was
available for him. He consistently maintained that he was ready and willing to
accept employment at all times either in the City of New York or in the City of
Baltimore. The local office predicates its conclusion that claimant was
unavailable on the fact that he left his Normal labor market to go to
Baltimore. Claimants labor market is any place in the United States where
garments are manufactured. The record clearly discloses that Baltimore is a
substantial garment center with an annual production in excess of $108,000,000
per year. The garment industry in that city includes the production of dresses
in which line claimant is engaged. The temporary shortage of job opportunities
in a going industry in Baltimore does not of itself establish claimant's
unavailability. Availability is claimant's readiness to accept work and not his
ability to obtain work in a going industry. The further argument of the local
office that claimant was unavailable because he failed to make individual
efforts to obtain work in Baltimore is without substance. Claimant was advised
by the employment service in Baltimore that the garment industry was undergoing
its slack season, a condition which was similar to that prevailing in New York
City. In the light of the information received, it appears to us it would have
availed claimant little particularly in the light of his advanced age, to
canvass industrial establishments in the City of Baltimore. Although our
experience indicates that there is some labor turnover during the slack period
in the garment industry, nevertheless claimant properly relied on the
information given to him by the employment service in Baltimore. We believe the
language of the Court in&nbsp;<u>Nelson v. Review Board of Indiana Security
Division et al</u>. 82 N.E. (2nd) 523 is in point. The court there said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

knows that job opportunities are limited to individuals 70 years of age and
over, and the record does not disclose a complete lack of effort to seek work
on the part of the claimant or a refusal to accept any type of employment on
the part of the claimant. It seems clearly apparent from a consideration of the
circumstances that the failure of the claimant to make a further independent
search for work was not proximate cause of his continued unemployment... The
availability test must be applied with a full consideration of the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. There must be some basis for an inference
that with some effort on behalf of claimant he could reasonably be expected to
find work for himself. Such basis does not exist in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is a sewing
machine operator, employed for many years in the City of New York. On June 22,
1949, he was laid off temporarily because of a decline in business. On June 23,
1949, he filed a claim for benefits, and informed the local office that he
desired to visit his married daughter in Baltimore. He requested permission to
report by mail during this visit to Baltimore .This request was denied and he
was informed that he must file an original claim in Baltimore, Maryland under
the Interstate Benefit Plan with New York. Claimant went to Baltimore and
remained there about a month, when he returned and resumed his employment in
New York City. While at Baltimore he reported there to the local unemployment
insurance office on several occasions. The issue presented is whether claimant
under the circumstances disclosed became unavailable for employment as a matter
of law. The Board has held that under the circumstances claimant was available
for employment and entitled to benefits during the period of his residence in
the City of Baltimore. It is to be noted that claimant made some effort to find
work and the record does not disclose any refusal on his part to accept
suitable employment. We think, therefore, the issue presented is clearly one of
fact, and that there is substantial evidence to sustain the , determination of
the Board. Decision unanimously affirmed with costs to claimant against the
Industrial Commissioner. (January 16, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unemployment, accepted work as a timekeeper and material checker in connection
with a certain alteration job taking place in a New York City hotel. The salary
was $50 per week. Claimant worked at this job for approximately 10 weeks until
January 13, 1950. At the time he left, there was still work available for him
and he could have continued on the job. He left the job believing that he had a
position with a manufacturer of automobile tires which he considered more in
keeping with his prior earnings and type of work. The claimant did not have a
definite job with the prospective employer but it was merely in the stage of
negotiation. The prospective job offer never materialized. He subsequently
tried soliciting orders on a free lance part-time basis for the automobile tire
firm but was unsuccessful. Prior to taking the material checker job claimant
worked for three months selling plumber and marine supplies on a commission
basis. He had a drawing account of $150 a week. At the termination of this
employment claimant’s drawings exceeded his earned commissions. Prior to this
employment claimant was employed as an expediter by a manufacturer of water
conditioning equipment. On this job claimant earned $58 a week. Claimant filed
for benefits on February 28, 1950. The local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits on the ground that
he voluntarily left his employment without good cause. The claimant requested a
hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination and the Industrial
Commissioner appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was had at which the claimant and a
representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken.
The claimant filed an original claim for benefits on December 9, 1949. By
initial determination he was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause, under circumstances indicating a withdrawal from
the labor market. He was ruled ineligible effective December 9, and until such
date as he certified to a bona fide return to the labor market and to his
availability for employment. The claimant was employed from July 18, 1949 to
November 4, 1949 at Utica, New York, by an electrical company as a foreman of
an assembly line at $68.50 per week. The claimant had previously been employed
by the same employer at Clyde, New York, for two and one-half years. The
employer closed its Clyde plant on June 30, 1949. The claimant voluntarily left
his employment at Utica, New York and returned to Clyde, New York, because he
anticipated becoming self-employed as the operator of a bar and grill. The
claimant had no definite plans regarding his self-employment when leaving his
job in Utica. Upon returning to his home at Clyde, New York, the claimant has
intermittently assisted his father-in-law in performing farm work. he
admittedly had made no search for work since filing his claim, stating that he
did not wish to accept employment and then leave such employment when he
entered into his business. There appears to be no reason why the claimant could
not have remained in his employment at Utica, New York, until definite plans
had been consummated regarding his entry into business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has made no effort to secure work and has been partially engaged in assisting
his father-in-law on a farm. Such circumstances reveal that the claimant

representatives of his union and of the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. Claimant, a fur cutter, filed for benefits on August 15,
1949. An initial determination ruled him ineligible for August 17, 1949, for
lack of total unemployment. Another initial determination ruled him ineligible
for August 18 through August 23 for failure to comply with reporting and
registration requirements. By an initial determination the claimant’s benefits
were forfeited for 42 effective days for a wilful false statement to obtain
benefits. It was further determined that the claimant had been overpaid $26.
The claimant admits that he was employed for approximately five hours on August
17, 1949, and earned on that day $23. He did not report that sum because he was
under the impression that earnings below $24 in one week did not effect his
eligibility, and, therefore, need not be reported. The employer for whom the
claimant worked on August 17 was the same employer that he had worked for
immediately preceding the filing of his claim of August 15. After his
employment, pursuant to the rules promulgated by the Industrial Commissioner,
the claimant was required to refile his claim on August 18, 1949, but did not
do so. The claimant alleges that he failed to refile his claim because he
either did not read the booklet of instructions furnished to him, or that he
forgot. The insurance office allowed the claimant a constructive refiling
effective August 23, 1949. The claimant’s application to excuse his failure to
refile his claim was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is undisputed that
the claimant was employed on August 17, 1949. In my opinion the claimant’s
application to excuse his failure to refile his claim was properly denied. The
claimant has shown no justifiable reason to excuse his omission. However, I am
of the opinion that the claimant did not wilfully misrepresent his employment.
It is to be noted that the employer for whom he worked on August 17 was the
same employer that he worked for immediately preceding the filing of his claim.
He knew or should have known that the insurance office communicates with the
last employer of a claimant. Furthermore, the claimant misunderstood that
provision of the Law dealing with the eligibility of a claimant earning more
than $24 a week. He mistakenly believed that earnings below that figure need
not be reported. That is understandable, and upon the proof submitted is
accepted. However, inasmuch as the claimant was not totally unemployed on
August 17, and did not refile his claim until August 23, he could not have any
effective days credited to him in the week ending August 21,1949. The initial
determinations of lack of total unemployment and failure to comply with
reporting requirements are sustained. The initial determination forfeiting the
claimant’s benefit days for wilful misrepresentation is overruled. The claimant
has been overpaid as charged. (December 21, 1949)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Appeal by the
Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board which affirmed a decision of an unemployment insurance referee overruling
an initial determination of the Industrial Commissioner that a forfeiture of
twenty-four &quot;effective days&quot; be imposed under Sec. 594 of the
Unemployment Insurance Law because the claimant had &quot;wilfully made a false
statement to obtain benefits.&quot; Claimant was laid off for a temporary
period on August 15, 1949 and filed a claim for benefits under the Unemployment
Insurance Law the same day. Two days later, on August 17, 1949, claimant returned
to work for the same employer for 5½ hours and was paid $23.00. At the end of
the week on August 23, 1949, claimant certified that he had suffered
&quot;total unemployment&quot; during the entire week ending August 21, 1949.
Concededly this information was false and claimant knew at the time that it was
false. The referee and the Unemployment Appeal Board have excused the false
statement on the theory that claimant misinterpreted the law and did not intend
to defraud. Sec. 594 does not require a criminal intent or proof sufficient to
support larceny. The officials charged with the proper administration of the
Unemployment Insurance Law are entitled to true facts upon which to make their
determination. If a claimant certifies to a false fact, knowing that it is
false, the statue authorizes the forfeiture regardless of claimant’s
interpretation of the ultimate effect of his false statement. Decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board reversed, on the law, and the initial
determination of the Industrial Commissioner reinstated, without costs.

     misunderstood their rights under the law, etc. The Court established that
     Section 594 of the law does not require &quot;a criminal intent or proof

     penalty forfeiture when a claimant certifies to a false fact, knowing that

     there is a failure to disclose true facts on which information relating to

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a sewing machine operator on men’s
shirts, was employed for a period of six years to February 1950 with a firm
located on West 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Street, in the Borough of Manhattan, City
of New York. At that time she resided in the Borough of Brooklyn. After her
separation from employment she moved to Laurelton, Borough of Queens. On
February 6, 1950, claimant refiled for benefits. On February 15, 1950, claimant
visited the local office and signed a statement in which she stated, among
other things, that she expected to be recalled by her last employer and that
she had no physical defects which might affect her working. On February 16,
1950 claimant was offered employment in her customary occupation on a piecework
basis in a union shop. This establishment was located on West 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Street,
Borough of Manhattan. Claimant contemplated contacting the prospective employer
but changed her mind because of the travel time involved. On March 9, 1950, in
a summary of insurance interview, claimant stated the following: &quot;I
refused to accept the referral because the traveling time is too long. That is
the only reason I refused the job. I will not accept a job in Manhattan – I
will work only in Queens and as a facing maker.&quot; Claimant would have been
required to travel one and one-half hours from her home to reach the
establishment of the prospective employer. The local office thereafter issued
an initial determination holding that claimant refused the proffered employment
without good cause and charged her with an overpayment in the sum of $52 in
benefits. Claimant contested this initial determination. At the scheduled
hearing before the referee, claimant offered a certificate issued by her
physician dated December 24, 1950 (incorrectly dated) to the effect that any
undue amount of travel caused claimant to be nauseous and for which reason her
physician suggested that claimant seek employment within a short distance from
her home. In a supplementary medical statement submitted by claimant’s
physician, it was stated that claimant was under the doctor’s care for January
1950 to April 6, 1950 and claimant’s alleged ailment was diagnosed as
&quot;Travel makes her (referring to claimant) nauseous.&quot; The referee
overruled the initial determination on the ground that, in view of claimant’s
alleged physical condition she was justified in refusing the job in question
because of the extended travel involved. From this decision the Industrial
Commissioner now appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is significant that when claimant resided
in the Borough of Brooklyn, she traveled for about six years to her last
employment in the Borough of Manhattan without any ill effect. On February 15,
1950, when claimant visited the local office and was requested to list any
physical defects, which might affect her working, she listed none. On March 9,
1950, when claimant was interviewed at the local office concerning her refusal
of the proffered employment, she stated that her only reason for doing so was
that &quot;The travel time is too long.&quot; In the light of the above factors
we cannot give any credence to the proof submitted by claimant which is vague
and contradictory. Claimant’s objection to traveling to the proffered employment,
therefore, seems to us to have been prompted by a consideration of personal
convenience rather than hardship. There remains one point on which to comment.
The Board has consistently held that travel consuming no more than one and
one-half hours one way is not excessive (Appeal Board, 20,444-49, 23,687-50).
Under these circumstances we must conclude that claimant refused, without good
cause, employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training and
experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

past 40 years and is a member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees and Motion Picture Operators Union of the United States and Canada
having general offices in New York City. He lost his employment, when the show
with which he was traveling closed. He bas been a resident of Berea, Virginia
for the past five years where he has his home. Claimant filed a claim for
benefits on February 13, 1950 in New York and returned to his home in Virginia
at which time he filed a continued interstate claim for benefits in
Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Out-of-State Resident Unit issued an initial
determination that claimant was unavailable for employment effective March 1,
1950. The basis of the determination was that the claimant removed himself from
an active labor market to an area where his type of employment was
non-existent, thereby rendering him unavailable for employment. At an insurance
interview held on April 27, 1950 in New York City, claimant stated that he went
to Berea, Virginia after he lost his last employment because his home was there
and that while in Virginia, he made contacts with his union and producers of
road shows by correspondence and telephone, seeking employment. Claimant works
as a traveling stage hand approximately six months a year and devotes an
additional two months to a side line hanging draperies for studios et cetera.
Claimant is not a member of the New York City local of his union. He is a
member of the El Paso, Texas local and has a traveling union card is sued by
the International Union. He is classified as a traveling stage employee and has
been so engaged for a number of years. He could only get a job as an extra in
New York when all the local members of the union are fully employed. Jobs as
extras were scarce in New York during the period of his unemployment. Claimant
customarily works anywhere in the United States in his own or a related line,
wherever such work is available. He exerted efforts to<i>&nbsp;</i>obtain work
by contacting former producers he worked for and friends in the same profession
and through the medium of the union. Claimant did not contact any employers
personally because he had found from previous experience that this was not an
effective method of obtaining work. It is not necessary for him to do so since
it is the usual and customary practice in his branch of the trade for the
employers to contact him by phone or mail and vice versa. Claimant has been
employed from March 31, 1950 to date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the premise that claimant moved from a locality in which work opportunities
exist to a community in which there are no work opportunities in his usual
occupation. The referee's conclusion lacks support in the record now before the
Board. Claimant's availability for employment is not to be judged by the
standards to be applied in a case where a claimant living in a small community
is willing to work only in the area in which he resides, where his normal labor
market is elsewhere. In the instant case, claimant did not impose any
limitations with respect to the local of his employment. Claimant has been
residing in his present home since 1946. He was willing to work and did work
anywhere in the United States. It cannot be said that solely because of the
nature of the efforts he exerted in search of such work he failed to satisfy
the availability requirements of the statute. Claimant sought work in the most
effective manner available to him and in the usual and customary method of
securing employment prevailing in his branch of the industry. During periods of
unemployment in his trade he obtains work hanging draperies as a side line, and
his continued unemployment during the period in issue is not attributable to
any lack of effort on his part to seek work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in Hungary, came to the United States in 1948 and his first employment was in
New York City. For about 10 months to September 10, 1949, he worked in
Cleveland, Ohio, as an apprentice pharmacist pursuant to a license issued to
him by the State of Ohio. He left the employment to study English and to take a
pharmacist's examination in Washington, D.C. which he took in April 1950. He
did not pass the examination. Claimant refiled a claim for benefits and
registered for employment in Miami, Florida, on November 21, 1949, having
arrived there the day before. He went there because his wife had a job in a
hotel in Miami Beach for the winter season. While there he sought work only in
the pharmaceutical line as apprentice pharmacist, or an assistant or clerk. At
the insurance interview he stated that he would accept a minimum salary of $50
per week although he previously earned $60 per week. Claimant could not find
work in Florida limited to filling prescriptions only as an assistant
pharmacist because all employers required the assistant also to work on other
counters as a salesman. Claimant admittedly could not do sales work because of
his limited knowledge of the English Language and consequently failed to find
work. Claimant was not licensed to practice pharmacy in Florida, but may have
been eligible for an apprentice license if he first found such employment.
Claimant and his wife returned to New York City on March 21, 1950. The
Out-of-State Resident Unit issued an initial determination disqualifying
claimant from benefits, effective November 21, 1949, on the ground that
claimant was unavailable for employment, inasmuch as his chances of securing
work in a drug store at a salary of $50 per week were remote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The referee overruled the initial
determination and held that claimant met the test of availability. The referee
pointed out the employers would not hire claimant because of local conditions
which required an apprentice pharmacist to do couriter sales work and that his
language difficulties prevented him from doing such work and concluded under
all the circumstances that claimant was available for employment. We cannot
agree With the referee's conclusions. In the course of his search for work in
his vocation, claimant learned in a relatively short time that the lack of a
pharmaceutical license and his lack of understanding of the English language
were two substantial obstacles to his securing the desired employment.
Nevertheless, he persisted in confining his search to work involving only the
filling of prescriptions. Thus, claimant virtually precluded himself from the
possibility of obtaining any employment while in Florida. We hold that
claimant's efforts to seek work fell short of meeting the test of availability
set forth in Appeal Board, 17,064-48*.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
