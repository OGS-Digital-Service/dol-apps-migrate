<P>Section 593.2 of the Unemployment Insurance Law provides for a disqualification from benefits if a claimant, "without good cause, refuses to accept an offer of employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience, including employment not subject to this article..."</P>
<P>The UI Reform Law amended Section 593.2, effective April 1, 1999, to provide different criteria during the second half of a claim. It states that claimants who are not subject to a recall date or who do not obtain employment through a union hiring hall and who are still unemployed after receiving thirteen weeks of benefits, must accept "any employment proffered that such claimants are capable of performing, provided that such employment would result in a wage not less than eighty percent of such claimant's high calendar quarter wages...and not substantially less than the prevailing wage..."</P>
<P>If a refusal issue arises <B>at any time</B> during a claim, there are four conditions to be satisfied before a claimant may be disqualified for refusal of employment.</P>
<ol>
<li><U>"A claimant....refuses employment..."</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a refusal disqualification to be imposed, the individual who refused employment must have been a claimant on the day of  the refusal. In other words, (s)he must have been claiming benefits for the day the refusal occurred.<br>
(However, see 1205 F 8.) </li>
<p></p>
<li><U>"Offer of employment"</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be an unconditional offer of a specified job starting on a definite date. A general discussion of job duties, working conditions, etc. does not constitute an offer of employment.  A referral to a job opening by the Employment Service is an offer of employment for the purposes of Section 593.2.</li>
<p></p>
<li><U>"Refuses to accept an offer"</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claimant may not be disqualified for  refusal of employment unless (s)he has actually refused to accept the job offer. In some cases the       refusal is obvious; the claimant unequivocally stated (s)he did not want the position. However, in some cases the facts will be less clear. A claimant's statements or actions deliberately calculated to discourage an offer of employment constitutes a refusal. Honest answers to questions posed by the prospective employer, expressions of genuine reservations about some aspect of the job or a good faith attempt to negotiate better conditions generally do not.</li>
<p></p>
<li><U>"Without good cause"</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 593.2 provides four conditions, the existence of any one of which requires a finding of good cause regardless of claimant's professed reasons for  refusal. <br>They are:</li>
<p></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>acceptance of such employment would either require the claimant to join a company union or would interfere with his joining or retaining membership in any labor organization; or.</li>
<p></p>
<li>there is a strike, lockout, or other industrial controversy in the establishment in which the employment is offered.  </li>
<P></P>
<li>the employment is at an unreasonable distance from his residence, or travel  to and from the place of employment involves expense substantially greater than that required in his former employment unless the expense be provided for;  or,</li>
<p></p>
<li>the wages or compensation or hours or conditions offered are substantially less favorable to the claimant than those prevailing for similar work in the locality, or are such as are likely to depress wages or working conditions.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<P>A further statutory condition, "reasonably fitted by training and experience", must be satisfied when a refusal issue arises during the <B>first thirteen weeks</B> of a claim for benefits.</P>
<blockquote>
After establishing that an offer of employment has been made, the local office must determine whether the position is suitable for the claimant. This requires an evaluation of the job duties and of the claimant's educational and work histories. Although the duties of the proffered job need not conform exactly to those of the claimant's previous job, nor utilize all of the claimant's skills or specialized training, there must be a reasonable matching of the claimant's qualifications to the job requirements.
</blockquote>
<P>However, a claimant who is still unemployed <B>after receiving thirteen weeks of benefits</B>, who has no recall date, and who does not obtain employment through a union hiring hall, must be willing to accept any work he is capable of performing.  For a claimant in this circumstance, the following principles apply:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The phrase "capable of performing" should be construed in a simple, plain language manner. Consideration must be given to any physical or mental limitation claimant may have.</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>A claimant's total lack of experience in a particular type of work would not, in and of itself, justify a refusal.</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>The fact that the skills required for a job may be below claimants' skills, would not be a relevant consideration.</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>A disqualification cannot be issued unless the offer of employment  would result in quarterly wages not less than eighty percent of  the claimant's high calendar quarter base period wages, and not substantially less than the wage prevailing for similar work in the locality.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A claimant, who refuses an offer of employment because it interferes with his attendance in training approved under the Federal Trade Act of 1974, may not be disqualified for that reason (sub. sec. 599.2). A claimant in training approved under sub sec. 599.1 also has good cause for refusing to accept an offer of employment that would interfere with training.</P>
<P>Even if all the above statutory requirements are met, a claimant may still be able to establish good cause for refusing employment. If the claimant's reason is of a compelling nature, no disqualification should be imposed.</P>
<P>Determinations should be consistent with the principles reported in this section of the Interpretation Service Index and the policies set forth in relevant Special Bulletins (A 710 series).      </P>

The disqualification period in such case is the same as a disqualification for refusal  of employment for an indefinite length of time.  (A.B. 29,661-51; <a href="10.htm#1088">A-750-1088</a>;  Principle sustained by <U>Matter of Lehrman</U>, 281 App. Div. 936)</li>

<li>Refusal without good cause to accept an offer of employment made through a channel  other than the employment service, resulted in disqualification from benefits.  (A.B. 7920-42; <a href="#A-750-411"></a>)</li>

<LI>"Subsequent employment which terminates a disqualification does not have to be new employment so that part-time employment continuing from before the date on which a             disqualification was incurred meets the requirement of the Law. (A.B. 82,477-61; <a href="15.htm#1565">A-750-1565</a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<LI>A back-pay award for wrongful discharge, covering a period  subsequent to a refusal disqualification, is "earned" remuneration for employment usable in terminating the disqualification (Section 593.2). (A.B. 129,914; <a href="16.htm#1652">A-750-1652</a>)</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Vacation pay is not usable in terminating a disqualification since it is not "subsequently" earned remuneration. (A.B. 144,502; <a href="16.htm#1696">A-750-1696</a>) </li>
<P> </P>

<!-- <LI>A claimant is not totally unemployed while on active duty in the reserve component of the Armed Forces. The periods of employment and compensation received may be used to terminate a disqualification. (A.B. 327,499; A-750-1907)</li>
 -->
<P> </P>
<li>Members of the Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States are totally unemployed while engaging in weekly drill sessions. Participation in and pay received for such drills are neither employment nor remuneration, and may not be used to terminate a disqualification (A.B. 344,489; A.B. 344,490; <a href="19.htm#1949">A-750-1949)</a></li>
<p></p>
<LI>A disqualification from benefits can only be terminated by "employment" as defined in the statute. The statutory definition of "employment" and its exceptions will govern the interpretation of the term "employment". <U>(Matter of Kent A. Greene, </U>89 8NY 2d 225, <a href="21.htm#2101">A-750-2101</a>) </LI>
<p></p>

<P> </P>
<li>A claimant may not be disqualified for a refusal of employment which takes place on a day on and for which he is not seeking benefits even though his subsequent claim for benefits includes the day on which the employment would have commenced. <U>(Matter of Foscarinis,</U> 284 App. Div. 476; <a href="13.htm#1308">A-750-1308</a>)</li>
<P>  </P>
<li>An original or additional claim filed in a week after the day of refusal without good cause in the same week, cannot be predated to a date earlier than the first day of unemployment following the refusal. (A.B. 70,207-59; <a href="15.htm#1509">A-750-1509</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>A claimant who refuses employment on the day when he files a claim may be disqualified even though the filing takes place after the refusal. (A.B. 60,962-57; <a href="14.htm#1461"></a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<li>A decision to engage in self-employment was not good cause for refusing  employment by failing to report for work which claimant, upon referral, had accepted. Nor could claimant, by merely failing to meet his next regular reporting day escape the consequence of his refusal on the ground that the refusal occurred at a time when he had ceased to be a claimant. (A.B. 14,725-47; <a href="08.htm#813">A-750-813</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Lapse of claim because of non-reporting does not prevent a disqualification for refusal of employment occurring during the   lapse, if the claimant is reinstated and the reinstatement covers the date on which the employment was refused. (A.B. 22,287-50; <a href="09.htm#953">A-750-953</a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<li>A disqualification for refusal of employment may apply to any  person who is a "claimant" that is, "seeking benefits, at the time of the refusal by having filed a claim, even though he has no right to benefits at that time for other reasons. <U>(Matter of Schurman,</U> 16 AD 2d 311; <a href="15.htm#1555">A-750-1555</a>. rev., similarly, A.B. 93,524)</LI>
<P> </P>
<li>A refusal disqualification is properly imposed for a refusal  which occurs during a period in which claimant reports regularly on her assigned reporting dates although claimant could not accrue benefit rights on the day of the offer because she had worked part of that day. (A.B. 28,721-51; <a href="10.htm#1079">A-750-1079</a>) </li>

<li><U>Relation to other disqualifications</u></li>
<P> </P>
<ol>
<li>A claimant who has been disqualified for refusal of employment without good cause is not subject to additional  disqualifications for refusing subsequent offers of the identical job. (A.B. 67,153-58 and 68,640-59; <a href="15.htm#1508">A-750-1508</a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<li>The principle that a claimant may not be disqualified twice for refusal of the same job is controlling even if the disqualification has been terminated by subsequent employment and           earnings. (A.B. 232,381)</li>
<P> </P>
<li>A disqualification from receiving benefits for refusal of employment may be imposed during a period of suspension from benefits because of misconduct. (A.B. 31,002-52; <a href="13.htm#1363">A-750-1363</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Disqualification for refusal of employment without good cause may be imposed even though claimant had previously been disqualified for voluntarily leaving the same employment. <U>(Matter of Crowe;</u> 305 NY 699; <a href="11.htm#1101">A-750-1101</a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<LI>A disqualification for refusal without good cause may apply even  though the refusal occurs during the disqualification period for a voluntary quit of the same employment. (A.B. 35,349-52; <a href="12.htm#1201">A-750-1201</a>; similarly A.B. 35,792-53; A.B. 39,289-53) </LI>
<p></p>
<LI>A disqualification may not be imposed for a refusal during a period                       of uncontested suspension from benefits because of an industrial controversy. (A.B. 53,245-55; <a href="14.htm#1407">A-750-1407</a>)</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Claimant, although refusing a job, is not subject to the refusal    disqualification but ineligible because of unavailability, if the refusal is for compelling personal reasons, indicating at the same  time restrictions which show that the claimant does not satisfy the availability requirements. (Child care) (A.B. 25,970-50; <a href="10.htm#1046">A-750-1046</a>)</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>An unavailability disqualification for self-imposed non-compelling   reasons does not preclude the imposition of an additional disqualification for refusal of employment even if the unavailability predates the refusal. (A.B. 77,331-60; <a href="15.htm#1536">A-750-1536</a>)</LI>
<p></p>
<LI>Refusal of a one day assignment because of a previously scheduled  personal engagement marking a significant event (i.e. claimant's birthday dinner celebration), constitutes a special circumstance and such refusal is with good cause. (A.B. 392.301; <a href="20.htm#2012">A-750-2012</a>) </li>

<li>General discussion between claimant and employment interviewer as to willingness of claimant to accept a position as a trainee in a war industry <U>without</U> an actual offer of referral to such work did not constitute an offer of employment and even though claimant expressed an unwillingness to accept such work, no disqualification for refusal can be sustained.

<p></p>
<li>A referral to part-time sales work to commence at an undetermined future date, the actual hiring to be done at that later date, was not a firm offer of or referral to employment. Disqualification from benefits can not rest on such referrals. (A.B. 11,590-45; <a href="06.htm#640">A-750-640</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal to accept a referral to employment was held to be without good cause, and the fact that the job order contained a notation that the job probably would not start until January 3 was insufficient of itself to vitiate the referral to  employment  made on December 20, since the employer had a definite job to offer which was not contingent, speculative or uncertain in its terms.

<li>A firm offer of a wage with an assurance of more if experience warranted is necessitated inquiry by the claimant of the employer to ascertain the exact wage that would be paid him.

<li>Where claimant's former employer for whom he had worked full time in the past offered to re-employ him for two days a week at    his regular rate of pay, claimant's refusal of that offer, because he wanted full-time and not part-time work, is without good cause. <U>(Matter of Gadd,</U> 278 App. Div. 1035; <a href="10.htm#1059">A-750-1059</a>).</li>

<li>Moving from a labor market where a claimant was able to earn a   high wage which established the benefit rate, to an area where the prevailing wage is below the claimant's benefit rate, does not provide good cause for refusal of employment because the offered job pays less than the benefit rate.

<li>Determining whether a claimant is reasonably fitted by training and experience for employment offered depends on whether a skill has been acquired, whether such skill is of             some value in the existing labor market and whether the offer of employment represents an attempt to match the  claimant's proved qualifications, in a reasonable degree, to specifications of existing jobs; in arriving at a conclusion a comparison between former wages and those offered provide an additional measuring rod. Finally, it must be determined whether the wages offered are substantially less favorable than those prevailing for similar work in the locality.

<p></p>
<li>Claimant, who refuses employment for which he is reasonably     fitted by training and experience, although not fitted with complete exactness, such as the baking of Italian and French bread and cakes against that of American style bread and rolls, does so without good cause since the statute does not     contemplate such a precise selection of employment. <U>(Matter of Strazza,</U> 278 App. Div. 1036; <a href="10.htm#1052">A-750-1052</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Possession of specialized skill, such as that of "chemical"  stenographer, does not constitute good cause for refusal of employment as a general stenographer since-the full             utilization of all skills is not the effective test to be applied under the statute, but rather the availability of work  for which the claimant is fitted by training and experience; an appreciable difference in salaries, $58 as against $41 a week, was disregarded. <U>(Matter of Greaser,</U> 279 App. Div. 702; <a href="10.htm#1064">A-750-1064</a>).</li>

<li>Refusal by a claimant of employment in his former occupation      because of his desire to utilize skills newly acquired in a training program under the Manpower Development and Training Act is with good cause when the claimant was not afforded a reasonable length of time to secure the work for which so trained.

<li>Previous employment as a <U>draught beer</U> salesman at $50 per week did not justify refusal of referral to employment as a <U>bottle beer</U> salesman at the rate of $45 per week. The Court decided:</li>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The salary difference of ten percent between the offered  employment and claimant's last employment was not such a drastic reduction as to justify a refusal. </li>

<LI>There is nothing in the law which asserts that a claimant should be allowed at least                 thirty days of benefits before being compelled to take a position. </li>
<p></p>
<li>The wording of the statute precludes the theory that a claimant may refuse employment simply on the basis that it involves some smaller degree of skill than his last employment. The employment offered must be one for which the claimant is reasonably fitted by training and experience and need not be at precisely the same level of skill at which he was last employed. <U>(Matter of Heater</U>, 270 App. Div. 311; <a href="06.htm#697">A-750-697</a>) </li>

<p></p>
<li>A claimant, unable to perform work utilizing highest skills     because of physical impairments, is expected to accept referral to employment at a lesser skill and wage consonant with his physical limitations. Thus, where the evidence indicated that claimant was unable to secure work, at his previously acquired highest skill as machinist, because of his physical limitations (diabetes, asthma, and high blood pressure), refusal of  employment as stock clerk and inspector of machine parts at reduced wages which would have utilized the claimant's presently highest attainable skill was without good cause. <U>(Matter of Nednick. </U>270 App. Div. 124; <a href="06.htm#687">A-750-687</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of referral to employment as a lathe operator by an apprentice machinist helper was with good cause since only part of his knowledge would have been utilized and acceptance    would have seriously retarded his training as a machinist which the State encourages through the adoption of Article 23 of the Labor Law.

<li>A sewing machine operator who completed a training course and was licensed as a hairdresser refused without good cause employment in her usual occupation since "where a person is reasonably fitted for more than one kind of employment, he does not bring himself within the benefits provided by the statue if he refuses one kind merely because he prefers the other". <U>(Matter of Delgado</U>, 278 App. Div. 237; <a href="10.htm#1015">A-750-1015</a>). </li>

<p></p>
<li>A claimant whose occupation is that of a model in the garment industry and who does not have any experience as a retail sales person "has good" cause in refusing a sales job in a retail establishment, even though conditions such as these prevail: claimant had been unemployed for an appreciable length of time; job opportunities as a model are temporarily  limited; the duration of the offered job is only temporary (Christmas season); the prospective employer does not require retail sales experience; during periods when the former employer did not utilize claimants services as a model because of diminished activity, claimant assisted other employees in work such as ticketing garments and preparing statements to customers for mailing.

<li>Refusal of employment necessitating one and one-half hours travel on         the ground that traveling made claimant nauseous, was without good cause even though supported by a medical statement; no credence was given to the vague and contradictory proof submitted by claimant who had previously traveled without ill effects and who, prior to the referee's hearing, informed the local office that she had no physical defects, the only reason for the refusal being "travel time is too long."

<li>Contention that proffered employment was at an unreasonable distance  was overcome by the fact that a large number of residents of claimant's community were employed by proposed employer and additional expenses were provided for by increased compensation.     (A.B. 7823-43; <a href="04.htm#423">A-750-423</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of employment was without good cause where transportation expense, although considerably in excess of the fare required in claimant's previous employment, was necessitated by the fact that claimant had in the meantime removed her residence to a more distant community, since it was not the legislative intent to make Section 593.2 (c) of the Unemployment Insurance Law applicable to a situation such as the one presented herein.

<p></p>
<li>If an employer demands <U>immediate</U> union membership as a condition of hire in employment to which the Federal Labor Management Act, 1947,(Taft-Hartley Act) applies, unwillingness to comply with such demand does not result in a disqualification for refusal without good cause since that Act declares such condition to be an unfair  labor practice. Under that Act, union membership may only be required as a condition of employment on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of  employment if there is a union agreement to that effect.

<li>Refusal to sign a form obligating a claimant to join a union within 30 days after commencing employment does not subject the claimant to disqualification for refusal of  employment. Under the Taft-Hartley Act union membership may  be required only on or after the thirtieth day of employment (A.B. 34,877-52). </li>
<p></p>
<li>A claimant, member of a union, does not have good cause to refuse, employment because it requires transfer to another local of the same union since such transfer would not have interfered with claimant's membership in a labor organization within the meaning of  Section 593.2a of the Law.

<p></p>
<li>If acceptance of proffered employment would not interfere with claimant's retention of membership in his union, refusal because of immediate loss of suspension of some membership benefits, such as hospitalization, and because of potential further losses, such as retirement and life insurance benefits, in the event of continued  employment in industries outside the union's jurisdiction does not constitute good cause for refusal of such employment.

<li>If a claimant who has reached the retirement age would be eligible for a pension under a union retirement plan in a few months by having completed two years of continuous employment exclusively within the jurisdiction of the local union or its affiliates, the claimant has good cause for the refusal of employment which would have broken this condition and required another two years of employment in compliance with the condition in order to reinstate     retirement eligibility.

(Case deals with detective agency guards) (A.B. 81,940-61 et al; <a href="15.htm#1559">A-750-1559</a>)</li>
<p></p>
<li>An agreement made in the course of employment to increase pay, with the amount and date specified, becomes, in the absence of special circumstances, a condition of the employment which, if not fulfilled, justifies voluntary leaving and subsequent refusal to return without such increase. (A.B. 165,156A; <a href="17.htm#1740">A-750-1740</a>) (For example of "special circumstances" see A.B. 50,097; <a href="13.htm#1374">A-750-1374</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Employment which meets statutory requirements may not be refused with good cause because the wages actually offered by  the employer at the job interview are lower than those specified by the Employment Service at the time of the referral. <U>(Matter of Krystofik</U>, 284 App. Div. 34; A.B. 38.921-53; <a href="12.htm#1248">A-750-1248</a> (Rev.)) </li>

<li><u>Prevailing rate </LI></u>
<p></p>
<OL>
<li>Refusal of employment is with good cause if the offered wages are more than 10% below a prevailing rate established on the basis  of the weighted average of the wages received by the middle 50% of workers in the occupation. <U>(Matter of Marsh</U>, 13 N.Y. 2d 235; A.B. 81,540; <a href="15.htm#1570">A-750-1570</a>)</li>
<p></p>
<li>Wages offered being less than the wages being paid to the  majority of employees actually engaged in work of a like nature in the locality constituted good cause for refusing employment even though the offered wages were equal to those being offered to new employees. (A.B. 11,354-44; <a href="06.htm#683">A-750-683</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>The proper method of determining whether an offered piecework rate meets the statutory requirements as to compensation in a particular job is to compare that rate with piecework rates being paid for similar work in the locality; a comparison with  claimant's previous earnings is not a proper test. (A.B. 44,131-54; <a href="13.htm#1323">A-750-1323</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Where claimant, a piece-worker and member of the dressmakers' union, refused referral because rate of pay was not then settled, disqualification was proper since it was the custom in the industry, and the claimant was cognizant of it, that the rates were settled at the commencement of the season between the shop committee which represented the employees and a representative of the employer and that such rates were prevailing rates. (A.B. 9774-43; <a href="05.htm#502">A-750-502</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of a job offer at a salary which bears a reasonable    relationship to claimant's demonstrated earning capacity is without good cause when it is not feasible to obtain reliable prevailing wage information because of the characteristics of the occupation. (A.B. 56.378-56; <a href="14.htm#1438">A-750-1438</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Generally, in determining the prevailing wage of an occupation    common to all industries (Ass't. Bookeeper), surveys of wages paid to such workers in the various industries should be taken into account rather than considering only wage surveys in a particular segment of industry (utility establishments.) (<U>Matter of Shotkin</U>, 10 A.D. 2d 738; <a href="15.htm#1517">A-750-1517</a>)</li>
<P> </P>
<li>Refusal of otherwise suitable employment as a pipe coverer at a shipyard is without good cause when the offered wages are those which prevail for such occupation in the marine industry even though the prevailing wages for pipe coverer in the building and construction industry are substantially higher and even though the occupational code classification is the same for pipe coverer in both these industries, when it can be found, as a fact, that the work of a pipe coverer in the marine industry is different  from that in the building and construction industry. <U>(Matter of Matvevich</U>, 15 A.D. 2d 387; A.B. UCFE 284-58; <a href="15.htm#1507">A-750-1507</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>The statutory requirement relating to prevailing wages applies to conditions in the locality of the proffered employment (Nassau County) rather than to conditions prevailing in the area of previous employment. (Queens County). (A.B. 41,331-54; <a href="13.htm#1324">A-750-1324</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Claimant who had moved from N.Y.C. to a suburban locality and      refused employment in her usual occupation in that locality because of a desire for higher wages, held to have refused employment without good cause since the employment offered was at the prevailing rate in the locality of her residence in which the opening existed. Her sporadic efforts to obtain employment in N.Y.C. where salaries for her occupation were higher were held insufficient to support her contention of availability in that area. (A.B. 21,391-49; <a href="09.htm#928">A-750-928</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>The job skills required by a regular teacher are different from those required of a per diem substitute teacher. Therefore; </li>
<p></p>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>A  claimant whose primary base period  employment has been as a regular teacher is not reasonably fitted by training and experience to be a per diem substitute teacher. </li>
<p></p>
<LI>To determine whether the wages offered for a per diem substitute position are "substantially less favorable than those prevailing for similar work in the locality," the rate to be considered is that prevailing for per diem teachers. (A.B. 346,109A; <a href="19.htm#1943">A-750-1943)</a> </li>
<p></p>
</ol>
<LI>Where a job offer is made to the claimant directly by an employer, the claimant's lack of kowledge of Prevailing Wage data prior to the refusal of employment does not provide good cause, since the Claimant Information Handbook advises claimant that such Prevailing Wage Information is available through the DoES offices and is also on the Department of Labor's public internet site. (A.B. 502,938A; <a href="21.htm#2115">A-750-2115</a>)</li>

<P> </P>
<ol>
<li>Employment which meets statutory requirements may not be refused with good cause because the wages actually offered by the  employer at the job interview are lower than those specified by the Employment Service at the time of the referral. (App. Div. <U>Matter of Krystofik</U>, 284 App. Div. 34; <a href="12.htm#1248">A-750-1248</a> (Rev.))</P>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of employment because the hours of employment are slightly  longer than stated on the Job Service order is without good cause. (A.B. 53,409-55) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Where claimant refused to submit to a physical examination required by his prospective employer, it was held that claimant refused an offer of employment without good cause. (A.B. 11,043-44; <a href="05.htm#586">A-750-586</a>; similarly, A.B. 18,846-49) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of employment is with good cause when claimant must pay for a physical examination in order to obtain the job. (A.B. 54,075-56; <a href="14.htm#1410">A-750-1410</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Disqualification  from benefits was applied where claimant,  mistakenly informed on first visit to employer that no opening existed, refused to return when error was ascertained. (A.B. 2059-40, <a href="00.htm#63">A-750-63</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>Refusal of an offer of reemployment by former employer is with good cause when past experience indicates that the employer subjects the  claimant to abuse and insults and when no assurance is given that this situation will be alleviated. (A.B. 39,362-53; <a href="12.htm#1220">A-750-1220</a>). </li>
<p></p>
<li>Prejudice against the garment industry was not good cause for  refusing employment therein. (A.B. 10,019-43; <a href="05.htm#513">A-750-513</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<li>The fact that claimant, a member of the enlisted reserve of the  United States Army, was subject to duty on twenty-four hours call, did not justify refusal of employment for which reasonably fitted by  training and experience. (A.B. 9541-43; <a href="04.htm#497">A-750-497</a>) </li>
<p></p>
<LI>Refusal of temporary employment in usual occupation during a slack period because of intention to leave the insurance office jurisdiction for a week's vacation was without good cause. The referee's decision was modified as he failed to pass on the primary issue of refusal but held that claimant was unavailable. (A.B. 13,853-46; <a href="07.htm#769">A-750-769</a>) </LI>
<p></p>
<li>Leaving employment because of employer's continual failure to pay wages on time in violation of law, is with good cause, and a refusal to return is justified when no assurance is provided against repetition of such practice. (A.B. 249,137; <a href="18.htm#1847">A-750-1847)</a> </li>
<p></p>
<li>Claimant's refusal to accept otherwise suitable employment, because she would be permitted to smoke only in a designated area, was without good cause. (A.B. 379,924; <a href="19.htm#1984">A-750-1984)</a> </li>
