Fact</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which representatives of the Industrial Commissioner and of the employer
appeared and testified. Claimant, a bookkeeper II, filed for benefits in Los
Angeles, California effective December 29, 1952. By initial determination
effective that date, she was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause. Claimant did not protest the initial
determination or did she authorize her employer to do so on her behalf.
However, the employer protested the initial determination disqualifying
claimant and requested a hearing, depositing the sum of $10 as required by
Section 620.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The Commissioner’s
representative raised an objection to a hearing on the merits on the ground
that claimant had not requested the hearing and that the employer was not a
party aggrieved or affected by such initial determination. Claimant was
employed in New York for ten years to November 28 on which date she resigned
after giving the employer one month’s notice. Initially, claimant alleged that
her resignation was occasioned by ill health and at the advice of her
physician, but thereafter indicated that she had not been under medical
treatment for a period prior to leaving. She was dissatisfied with her progress
at the employment and she believed she had reached &quot;a dead end.&quot; She
therefore decided to change her environment and move to California for
employment purposes. According to the employer, claimant had been falling
behind in her work and from time to time, an assistant had been supplied to
enable her to bring the work up to date. Several months before the termination
of her employment, claimant was told that assistance would not be given her and
that if she could not handle the work by herself, she would be replaced by
another employee who could. Claimant continued to work and then gave notice as
aforementioned. Had she not resigned from her job, she would not have been
discharged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Section 620.1(a) of
the Law provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;A
claimant who is dissatisfied with an initial determination of his claim for
benefits or any other party affected by such determination, may, within twenty
days after the mailing or personal delivery of notice of such determination,
request a hearing.&quot; (Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Commissioner’s
preliminary objection is well taken. Although the statute uses the term
&quot;other party affected&quot; and does not use the term
&quot;aggrieved&quot; the proper reading of the Section requires a holding that
the other party must be affected to his detriment before he may request a
hearing. It should be noted that only a claimant who is dissatisfied is granted
the right to request a hearing as it is correctly presumed that no hearing will
be requested by claimant when the determination is in his favor. Proper
construction requires the insertion of the word &quot;adversely&quot; after
&quot;affected.&quot; To hold otherwise would enable any party to place
frivolous objections and protests and cause innumerable hearings, which would
serve no purpose. Due process requires merely that a person aggrieved be
granted the right to appeal, not a person in whose favor an initial
determination is issued. Accordingly, the employer is not entitled to a hearing
on the merits. Since the employer is not entitled to a hearing on the merits
and since claimant’s benefits were not withheld by virtue of the employer’s
protest and deposit, the employer is entitled to a refund of its deposit. The
initial determination remains in effect. The employer is entitled to a refund of
its deposit. (April 24, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be distinguished from those in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Crowe</u>, 280 App. Div. 427,
reversing Appeal Board, 38,204-51; aff’d Court of Appeals, April 23, 1953. The
referee did so on the premise that since claimant refused to return to the
employer during the disqualification period for voluntary leaving of
employment, without good cause, said refusal was part of the leaving of
employment and is not to be deemed a separate disqualifying condition as to the
claimant. We are not in accord with the referee’s conclusion. The facts herein
are to be governed by the rules set forth in the&nbsp;<u>Matter of Crowe</u>,&nbsp;<u>supra</u>.
There were two separate acts involved and, therefore, the disqualifications
issued for both the refusal and voluntary leaving of employment were proper. We
have held that a disqualification for refusal of employment may be imposed
against a claimant during a disqualification period for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause. (Appeal Board, 18,477-48; 31,640-52) The
disqualification for refusal of employment without good cause, effective August
19, 1952, was properly imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which the claimant and a representation of the Industrial Commissioner appeared
and testified. Claimant filed an original claim effective claim effective July
2, 1951. By an initial determination, the claimant was ruled ineligible from
October 1, 1950 to November 5, 1950, from January 22, 1951 to March 18, 1951
and from July 2, 1951 to July 15, 1951, for unavailability for employment. As a
result of the determination, the claimant has been overpaid $286 for the
periods ending March 18, 1951. For several years, the claimant worked at silk
mills in the vicinity of Port Jervis. Prior to that, he was a drill runner and
a miner. On March 1, 1949, the claimant and another person, who was also a textile
worker, purchased a retail liquor store in Port Jervis. Each contributed
$15,000 toward the co-partnership. Thereafter, the store was open for business
from 8 a.m. to 10:45 p.m. for six days a week. When interviewed on November 8
the claimant stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that date I was unemployed and collecting unemployment insurance. This
continued until week ending November 5, 1950 when I went back to work. Again
Francis Finan became employed on January 22, 1951 while I was unemployed and
collecting unemployment insurance. This continued up to week ending March 18,
1951. During this entire period from October 19 to November 5, 1950 and from
January 22, 1941 to March 18, 1951 I worked in the liquor store from 3:30 p.m.
to 11 p.m. (about 8½ hours) Monday to Friday. On Saturday I would only work 7½
hours at the liquor store. During that period mentioned above I could take
work, because my wife could relieve me in the store. I would have taken
acceptable work during the period mentioned above. During the period July 2 to
July 15, 1951 I worked 7½ hours a day Monday to an including Saturday at the
liquor store. I was on vacation for which I did not receive any pay from July 2

Opinion and Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This case presents the
question of whether one who devotes substantially his full time to a business
of which he is one of the owners, while awaiting recall to an outside
employment in which he was formerly engaged, is &quot;unemployed&quot; within
the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law and is eligible for benefits
thereunder. In the absence of any statutory provisions giving a special meaning
to the words used, a negative answer would seem to be obvious. One who is &quot;self-employed&quot;
is not &quot;unemployed.&quot; The appellant’s argument to the contrary rests
solely upon the definition of &quot;employment&quot; in §511 of the Labor Law,
subdivision 1 of §511 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;General
definition. ‘Employment’ means any service under any contract of employment for
hire, express or implied, written or oral.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>From this the appellant
argues that to constitute employment within the meaning of the statute there
must be a contractual master and servant relationship and that one who is the
sole proprietor of a business or a co-partner in a business enterprise is not
in law an employee thereof. Therefore, the appellant argues, one who engages in
business for himself or as a co-partner, after being laid off from an outside
employment, is not engaged in any &quot;employment&quot;; ergo, he is
&quot;unemployed.&quot; The appellant’s obvious error consists of applying a
general definition which was intended to indicate the scope of the coverage of
the statute, to the wholly unrelated question of what constitutes unemployment
within the meaning of the statute. He overlooks the fact that the term
&quot;total unemployment&quot; and the term &quot;employment&quot; as used in
connection therewith are specifically defined in §522 of the Labor Law as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
margin-left:1.0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;’Total
unemployment’ means the total lack of any employment on any day, caused by the
inability of a claimant who is capable of and available for work to engage in
his usual employment or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by
training and experience.&nbsp;<u>The term ‘employment’ as used in this section
means any employment including that not defined in this title</u>.&quot;
(Emphasis added)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The last sentence of the
section would have been clearer if the word &quot;work&quot; had been used in
the text of the definition instead of the word &quot;employment&quot; but it is
plain enough that this is what was intended. The word &quot;employment&quot; is
synonymous, in a colloquial sense, with &quot;work&quot; and the standard
dictionaries so define it. The last sentence of §522 should be read as
providing that the term &quot;employment&quot; as used in that section means
any work for profit or remuneration, whether or not it is included within the
term &quot;employment&quot; as defined in subdivision 1 of §511 (cf. §205(5)
and §207 of the Workmen’s Compensation Law). Self-employment is clearly work
for profit; one who is self-employed is engaged in employment within the
meaning of §522 and he cannot claim any unemployment insurance benefits. There
can be no controversy about the application of this conclusion to the facts of
this case. The appellant was employed from time to time in a silk mill. He an
another mill employee purchased a retail liquor store, which they operated as,
co-partners. Their partnership agreement provided that they were to give their
full-time to the business but, in practice, if one of the partners was working
at the mill, the other partner would run the store. While both partners were at
work at the mill, the appellant’s wife took care of the store during their
work-shifts but they worked additional hours in their off time. The appellant
was laid off from mill employment for periods of varying length in 1950 and
1951. During these periods he worked the usual hours of the business day in the
liquor store. These are the periods for which the appellant claimed
unemployment insurance benefits. This claim was properly rejected under the
construction of §522 of the Labor Law set forth above. There was no time during
which the appellant was unemployed; therefore no question arises under §523 of
the Labor Law as to whether the claimant’s earnings during any week in which
unemployment occurred exceeded the sum of $30.00. Neither does any question
arise in this case as to whether the claimant was disqualified for benefits
under any of the provisions of §593; the claimant was not denied benefits
because he was unavailable for outside employment. It may be assumed that he
was available for recall to the mill at all times but the fact remains that he
was at work in the liquor store and was not unemployed while awaiting the call.
The decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board is affirmed without
costs. (March 12, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the last mentioned of these elements is needed, in order that there be
self-employment within the meaning of the decision, is also indicated by the
Court’s conclusion that &quot;employment&quot; for the purpose of Section 522
requires &quot;work for profit or remuneration.&quot; This conclusion shows at
the same time that ownership, which results in income without &quot;work&quot;,
is not such self-employment. Similarly, incidental activities for the prime
purpose of merely protecting that which normally flows from ownership does not
seem to constitute such self-employment. Thus, an individual, who owns real
estate, should not be considered as engaged in self-employment if his
activities are confined to matters such as collecting rents, removing ashes,
ordering repairs, keeping the necessary books, etc., unless these activities
acquire such proportion that he must be considered as engaged in the business
of managing real property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the first of the above mentioned elements, that is, whether the claimant
operates an &quot;established&quot; business, rules of common sense apply. An
individual, for instance, who on occasion acts as an insurance solicitor among
his relatives and friends, can hardly be classified as having an established
business. It appears, therefore, that only a person who can in some form be
considered as having set himself up in business should be considered as being engaged
in self-employment. Likewise, a worker who is also a &quot;subsistence&quot;
farmer cannot be said to be established in the farming business. A
&quot;subsistence&quot; farmer is an individual who cultivates land and
maintains livestock without, generally, selling the products but using them in
his own household.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

further question, that is whether the services rendered are of such extent that
they constitute &quot;self-employment&quot; satisfying the requirements, can in
most, if not practically all, cases be answered on the basis of time and effort
spent on them. If the time and effort are negligible, it is safe to conclude
that the requirements of self-employment are not met.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

     when a claimant renders personal services for which he is paid, but the
     relationship with the principal is not that of employer-employee
     (master-servant). An illustration may be the case of the unemployed worker
     who on occasion renders services, such as making repairs or doing errands
     for neighbors and acquaintances, under circumstances which do not make him
     an &quot;employee.&quot; Is his work &quot;self-employment&quot; so that
     he could not be considered as totally unemployed? It seems that the answer
     should be in the negative. The rationalization is that he is not engaged
     in a self-employment, that is, he does not operate a business enterprise
     for doing odd jobs and, therefore, basically relates back to the
     discussion under &quot;2&quot; above: Rendering such or other personal
     services constitutes self-employment only if the individual holds himself

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was employed as an inserter in a
mailing office for eight years ending March 23, 1953. In 1950, the employer and
the U. union entered into contractual relations and as a result thereof,
claimant then became a member of the U. Union and paid dues for two years to
July 1952. At about the latter time, claimant became aware of the fact that the
U. union was no longer in existence because it had been replaced by the D.
union, with which the employer had a closed shop agreement. Claimant was
unwilling to remain a member of or to support the D. union. She disassociated
herself from this group by refusing to pay union dues or to attend its
meetings. Claimant is not opposed to membership in a union as a matter of
principle, but she refused to be affiliated with the D. union because she
deemed it to be a &quot;left-wing&quot; union. She was opposed to the officers
governing the union’s operations because she was not in accord with their
economic philosophy then being supported by the union membership. Based on
widely publicized reports in the daily press of a judicial rebuke received by
the union’s officers for their contumacious conduct, and official
investigations of the union’s activities, claimant sincerely believed that the
economic precepts and political philosophy propagandized and supported by the
D. union were inimical to the best interests of our country and contrary to the
fundamental concepts upon which, our government is founded. Claimant deeply
resented paying due to a union, which she sincerely regarded as politically
subversive and dangerous to the welfare of the nation. She sincerely felt that
she could not be a member of the D. union without suffering a serious conflict
of conscience. Therefore, she refused to pay dues to that organization. As a
result, the union insisted upon claimant’s discharge from her employment, which
was terminated on March 23, 1953. Claimant filed a claim for benefits,
effective March 24, 1953. Based on an interview had with the claimant at the
local office, an initial determination was issued disqualifying claimant from
receiving benefits for 42 days, effective March 24, 1953, on the ground that
she had voluntarily left her employment without good cause, because of her
discontinuance of meeting union shop requirements. Claimant requested a hearing
and the referee sustained the initial determination. Claimant thereupon
appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant’s sincerity is not questioned. There is no reason to doubt that
claimant’s failure to maintain her membership in the D. union was the result of
an abhorrence, which she felt for that organization. Claimant’s feelings and
beliefs were not fanciful, but based on facts, which were common knowledge.
Thus, there existed a reasonable basis for her belief, which caused her to
refuse to continue membership in the D. union. She registered her protest in
the only way possible. Her failure to pay dues to the D. union was neither
arbitrary nor capricious. Under such circumstances, we are of the opinion that
claimant had good cause in permitting her employment to be terminated by
discharge, which was not tantamount to a voluntary leaving. The initial
determination of the local office, disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 consecutive days, effective March 24, 1953, on the ground that
she voluntarily left her employment without good cause, is overruled. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (June 19, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a comptometer operator, filed a
claim effective April 27 for State and Supplemental veteran benefits. By
initial determination effective April 27 claimant was disqualified for 42 days
for voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. Claimant was employed
from March 14, 1950 to January 10, 1951. His last salary was $39 weekly. He
left the job because he was dissatisfied with the progress he was making. His
supervisor encouraged him to leave, indicating that there was no future for
him. Claimant entered the Army on January 29,1951, and was honorably discharged
on January 29,1953. At the hearing, the employer’s representative stated that
it was difficult to say whether a job would have been open at the time of
claimant’s discharge from the armed service, since jobs were filled from time
to time and occasionally such jobs were open. It is the contention of the
insurance office that the principle stated in appeal Board, 33,809-52 is
applicable herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It has been ruled that
leaving a job because of lack of prospects is a leaving without good cause. It
is so held herein. Claimant voluntarily left his employment without good cause
when he resigned as of January 10, 1951. The only question remaining is the
effect of claimant’s military service. In the case above cited, it was held
that a veteran who had rights of reinstatement under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act, who does not accept an offer of reinstatement is held
to have voluntarily left employment without good cause. The facts herein are
substantially different. This claimant has no rights to reinstatement; he left
his job without good cause prior to his military service and there is no
evidence that a job existed after the termination of his military service. It
has been further held that a claimant's last employment is the determinative
employment in regard to which an issue of voluntary leaving of employment can
arise. For unemployment insurance purposes, military service should be given
the same status as subsequent employment. (See in re&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>, 381
App. Div. 426; appeal Board, 30,879-52). It would appear to be the policy of
this state to avoid penalizing a veteran for his actions prior to his military
service. (See Military Law, Section 323.) The initial determination is
overruled. (July 1, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

resides. She is self-supporting. In order to help pay the cost of maintaining
her home, claimant rents four rooms. She does all the cleaning and maintenance
of her own home with the help of a boy employed for that purpose. For three
years ending March 24, 1953, claimant was employed as a chambermaid in a hotel
on a part-time basis. Her hours of employment were from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. for a
six-day week, for which she received $18.15. Her employment was terminated by
illness. Claimant filed a claim for benefits, effective March 30, 1953, and
registered for employment. On April 9, 1953, the State Employment Service
offered claimant a job as a chambermaid in a rooming house. The hours were to
be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. for a six-day week and the remuneration was $14 per
week. Claimant refused the job offer because it involved cleaning 38 rooms and
windows. Based upon a report from the employment service and after an
interview, the local office issued the final initial determinations, (1)
holding claimant ineligible for benefits, effective March 30, 1953, on the
ground that she was unavailable for employment; (2) holding claimant ineligible
for benefits, effective the same date, on the ground that she was not totally
unemployed and (3) in the alternative disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits, effective April 9, 1953, on the ground that, without good cause, she
refused employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training and
experience. Claimant contested the initial determinations and requested a
hearing. The referee overruled the initial determinations holding claimant
ineligible for benefits on the grounds of unavailability and lack of total
unemployment, but sustained the initial determination disqualifying claimant
for job refusal, effective April 9, 1953. The Industrial Commissioner appeals
from that part of the decision of the referee, which overruled the initial
determination of the local office holding that claimant, was not totally
unemployed within the meaning of the Law. Claimant did not appeal to this
Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Div. 426, affirming Appeal Board, 30,879-52. We do not agree with the
Commissioner’s premise that claimant was engaged in the operation of a
business. Claimant owned the home in which she resided. She performed the
normal household duties of any housewife who is gainfully employed during the
daytime. The fact that she rented four rooms out of a total of 14 did not
change the character of the place which was essentially that of a home. She was
not engaged in the rooming house business for the purpose of gaining a
livelihood. Claimant was willing to accept employment on the same basis as her
previous employment. She was therefore available for employment and was totally
unemployed within the meaning of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is licensed to practice as a
registered nurse in the States of New York and New Jersey. After complying with
the legal requirements to practice nursing, claimant spent about two additional
years in hospital training and private employment in order to qualify as an
industrial nurse. Industrial nursing is a recognized, specialized field in the
nursing profession. Between October 16, 1950 and April 8, 1953, claimant, while
residing in New York City, was employed as an industrial nurse by a large
corporation in that city at a salary of $284 a month. Claimant filed an
original claim for benefits, effective April 27, 1953. She is classified as an
industrial nurse. She presently resides with her husband in Rockland County
where they have a house. She desires employment as an industrial nurse and
before leaving her last employment and since filing her claim for benefits, has
actively sought such employment at a number of large firms located in Rockland
County and in Orange County. Claimant has been interviewed and promised
employment upon the occurrence of a vacancy by one of the larger employers in
her area. She has applications on file with a number of establishments, at one
of which ten industrial nurses are employed. In addition, claimant has sought
assistance in obtaining employment from an industrial nurses’ group of which
she is a member, and has inquired as to leads to jobs of her friends practicing
her profession in Rockland County. She has reported at the employment service
as required, seeking assistance in her search for employment but that office
has never offered to refer claimant to any job opening. By initial
determination, effective April 27, 1953, claimant was disqualified from
receiving benefits on the ground that she had withdrawn from the labor market,
and in addition, was disqualified from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive
days, effective upon her return to the labor market, on the ground that she voluntarily
left her employment without good cause. The referee overruled the initial
determination of the local office, and the Industrial Commissioner filed an
appeal to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Appeal Board Opinion</span></u><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: On this appeal the Industrial Commissioner, in
his brief submitted to the Board for its consideration, limits his appeal to
that portion of the decision which overruled the initial determination of the
local office holding that claimant withdrew from the labor market. The
contention is made that the referee’s decision should be modified to hold that
claimant was unavailable for employment, because she sought employment only as
an industrial nurse and failed to look for employment as a general registered
nurse. Thus, in effect, the sole issue before the Board is whether or not
claimant was available for employment. The Industrial Commissioner does not
contend that there are no employment opportunities for industrial nurses in
Rockland County where claimant resides, nor that claimant did not in fact
diligently seek employment as an industrial nurse, her occupational
classification. It is argued, however, that because a greater opportunity for
employment in general nursing may exist than in claimant’s specialized field of
industrial nursing, claimant limited her job opportunities and a likelihood of
obtaining employment by seeking only industrial nursing. Thus, it is contended
that claimant was unavailable for employment unless she independently sought
and was ready to accept employment outside of her specialized field of nursing.
But the issue before us is not the availability of work for the claimant but
the availability of the claimant for work. (Appeal Board, 12,626-46, 17,200-48,
23,041-50, 29,444-51) Although not susceptible of a precise definition, we have
long held the phrase &quot;available for work&quot; to mean claimant’s
readiness, willingness and ability to continue to perform work for which he is
reasonably fitted by training and experience. (Appeal Board, 2065-40, 2717-40,
5540-41, 29,444-51) Claimant’s diligence of effort to obtain work for which she
is fitted by training and experience and the existence of such employment
opportunities in her locality are not challenged. In addition to her
independent, fruitless efforts, to find employment, the employment service,
upon which claimant relied because of its access to many more sources of
employment than any individual claimant could possibly have, significantly
never referred her to a possible job opening, either as an industrial or
general nurse. It is at once apparent, that if any doubt as to claimant’s
availability for employment existed, it might readily have been resolved by the
employment office by an offer of employment for which she is reasonably fitted
by training and experience. Had an offer of employment been made to claimant in
the general nursing field and refused, a different issue would be presented.
Willingness to work is indicated when a claimant is ready to accept a job
(appeal Board, 11,709-45), but no job offer was given to claimant. Claimant’s
inability to find work in her field may not be used as a basis to establish
that she was unavailable for work. (Appeal Board, 16,359-47, 23,041-50) In our
opinion, in light of all of the facts and circumstances in this case, we
believe that claimant was in the labor market and has met the test of
availability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, an assistant claims examiner in the Division of Employment
of the Department of Labor of the State Of New York, filed effective February
23, 1953. By initial determination effective February 26 claimant was ruled
ineligible because of lack of total unemployment. Claimant last worked from
February 1, 1950 to November 22, 1952. He was a permanent employee in the
classified Civil Service of the State of New York. On November 22 he suffered a
heart attack. He was on paid leave from the date to December 19. From December
20 claimant has been on leave of absence without pay. Such leave will terminate
in November 1953. Medical evidence disclosed that claimant’s condition had
improved to the extent that he may work full time, but he was prohibited from
returning to his last position because of the sustained pressure and tension
required by that job. Claimant is an attorney and seeks employment as such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

from&nbsp;<u>Matter of Blitz</u>, 302 N.Y. 573, affirming 275 App. Div. 1015,
reversing Appeal Board, 18,942-49, because claimant is not in a&nbsp;<u>paid</u>&nbsp;leave
status as was the fact in that case. In&nbsp;<u>Matter of Brownell</u>, Appeal
Board, 35,409-52, the Industrial Commissioner’s contention, that the rights
protecting the status of a State employee who had been suspended without pay
and whose name had been placed on a preferred list pursuant to Section 31 of
the Civil Service Law, were of no consequence in determining eligibility for
unemployment insurance benefits, was sustained. Such an employee had the right
of reinstatement to his own or similar position and was endowed with certain
other rights protecting his status in State service. It has been held that a
tax assessor who received $500 per year and who usually performed his services
between the second week in September and the last day in December was totally
unemployed during the balance of the year (<u>Matter of Blackburn</u>, appeal
Board, 29,690-51). Analogous situations arose in recent cases dealing with the
subject of vacation pay. There, employees were laid off for definite periods,
part of which was covered by paid vacations. In those cases, the appeal Board
has consistently held that the period covered by paid vacation was one of
employment for which no unemployment insurance benefits could be paid, and the
period for which the employees received no payment, was one for which benefits
could be payable. In those cases similar to this, the employees had rights of
re-employment based on seniority and union rules. Claimant has rendered no
services and received no remuneration since filing his claim. He has a right to
return to his position if his condition permits, only, if such improvement
occurs prior to November 1953. He has had no employment on any day since the
termination of his paid leave in any occupation for which he is reasonably
fitted by training and experience. Claimant is total unemployed. The initial
determination is overruled. (April 10,1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a salesperson, was last employed for
approximately four and one-half years in that capacity with a women’s retail
specialty shop. She worked six days a week receiving a terminal salary of $60
weekly. The employer is a co-partnership consisting of a husband and wife,
operating several stores. Claimant was employed in a store located in Jackson
Heights, New York, of which the wife was in charge. On the morning of May 9,
1953, claimant and the wife engaged in a verbal altercation, precipitated by
the latter. During the progress thereof, the partner discharged the claimant,
called her a vile name and otherwise directed vile, abusive, obscene and
indecent language at her. This was but one of a series of similar incidents.
Claimant filed a claim for benefits, effective May 11, 1953, and registered for
employment. On May 11, 1953, claimant contacted the other partner for the
purpose of obtaining salary due her for her previous week’s work. At the
partner’s invitation, claimant later that day conferred with him in person.
During the course of the conversation, claimant was requested to return to her
former employment. When she manifested a reluctance to accept, the partner
showed her a form received from claimant’s local unemployment insurance office
where she filed for benefits. He stated that if claimant did not accept
re-employment he would not facilitate her claim for benefits. The partner
prevailed upon the claimant to think the matter over for a week before arriving
at a definite decision. At the expiration thereof, claimant telephoned the
employer stating that she did not desire to return to her former employment.
Claimant diligently sought employment, as a result of which, through her own
efforts, she became re-employed on July 1, 1953, as a cashier in a
luncheonette. Based on an interview with claimant, the local office issued an
initial determination disqualifying her from receiving benefits for 42
consecutive days, effective the date of filing, on the ground that she
voluntarily left her employment without good cause. A second initial
determination was issued, effective the same date, disqualifying claimant from
receiving benefits on the ground that, without good cause, she refused
employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training and experience. In
the alternative, she was held ineligible for benefits, effective the same date,
on the ground that she was unavailable for employment. Claimant requested a
hearing and the referee overruled the initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for voluntary leaving. No appeal was taken
therefrom. The referee sustained the initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for refusal of employment without good cause.
He did not rule on the alternative initial determination holding claimant unavailable
for employment. Claimant appealed from the adverse portion of the referee’s
decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in sustaining the initial
determination of the local office with respect to claimant’s refusal of
employment, concluded that claimant advanced no compelling reason for such
refusal. We do not subscribe to this view. For several years, in the course of
her employment, claimant had been subjected to abuse and insults. When the
offer of re-employment was made, it was unaccompanied by any guarantee that
this situation would be alleviated. A claimant, in our opinion, should not be
compelled to accept employment under such conditions under pain of being
disqualified from receiving benefits. Since claimant had been discharged under
exceedingly unpleasant circumstances, we believe that she was not unreasonable
in refusing an offer of re-employment unless she received further assurance
against a recurrence of these acts. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the
offer of re-employment was not made in good faith and we seriously question
the&nbsp;<u>bona fides</u>&nbsp;thereof. We are convinced that the offer was
advanced, knowing that the claimant most likely would reject the same. We are
persuaded that the employer’s motive for making such offer was to form a basis
for claimant’s disqualification from benefits. It appears that claimant exerted
diligent efforts in search of employment. Her success in procuring a job on her
own initiative within a reasonable time after filing for benefits supports such
conclusion. Under all the facts and circumstances herein, we are persuaded that
claimant did not, without good cause, refuse employment for which she is
reasonably fitted by training and experience, within the meaning of the Law.
She was available for employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Findings of Fact: Claimant
was employed by a company as a sand mixer for 17 years, and was otherwise
employed by this company for 20 years before that. On January 30, 1953 he was
compulsorily retired because he had reached the age limit of 65 years. He
receives a pension from the company and also social security old age benefits.
He filed an original claim for benefits effective February 2, 1953. Claimant,
upon being compulsorily retired, made application in at least three places for
work. He made applications at other factories, but his name was not taken. He
was ready and willing to do the kind of work he had been doing, or other kind
of work, with regular hours, and at the prevailing rate of pay for such work.
He was willing to forego his security benefits if he obtained such employment.
Claimant’s understanding of the English language and his ability to speak it
are poor. Because of his age, and likewise because of this language difficulty,
he met no success when he sought out prospective employers and applied for
work. They did not understand him and he did not understand them. The
employment service gave him no guidance, nor did it offer him any job
referrals. Based on an interview held with the claimant on June 15, 1953, the
local office issued an initial determination, effective that day, holding that
claimant was ineligible to receive benefits on the ground that he was
unavailable for employment. The claimant protested the determination and
requested a hearing. The referee sustained the determination. Claimant appeals
to this Board from such adverse decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employment, without restriction as to type of work, or hours, or wages, which
would render him unavailable. Claimant, because of his handicaps of age and
language difficulty, presented a special problem to the employment service. He
did not retire voluntarily, but was forced to do so because of his age. He was
in the labor market, willing to do suitable work at prevailing pay. Proper
guidance in his case was in order, but this guidance the employment service failed
to provide, contrary to its own general policy in such a situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of a laundry, about a month prior to June 20, 1953 notified his employer that
he contemplated resigning his position because allegedly he was displeased with
a certain policy adopted by the employer and the long hours he was required to
service affected his health and interfered with his domestic affairs. The
employer requested claimant to continue in its employ until he could be
replaced. He agreed to do so. On June 20 the employer, having found a
replacement for claimant, notified him that his services were no longer needed.
Claimant filed an application for benefits, effective June 22, 1953. The local
office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 days, effective June 22, 1953, on the ground that he
voluntarily left his employment without good cause. The claimant contested the
initial determination on the ground that claimant was willing to continue his
employment beyond June 20, 1953 and that his separation from employment on June
20 constituted a discharge and not a voluntary leaving without good cause. From
said decision, the Industrial Commissioner appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

referee that claimant did not voluntarily leave his employment without good
cause, which was based on the premise that no definite time had been fixed for
claimant’s leaving his employment and that at the time of his discharge he was
willing to continue for an indefinite time. Claimant disclosed at the hearing
before the referee that he did not intend to continue in his employment on and
after June 22, 1953 because of physical reasons and that he expected to
relinquish his position as soon as he was replaced which occurred on June 20,
1953. Claimant’s purported reasons for desiring to leave this employment as
presented by the record before us were too intangible to constitute good cause
for leaving under the Law. When such termination should take place was not
fixed by date but was fixed by agreement between claimant and the employer as
of the time the employer could obtain a replacement. Thus a definite time was
fixed for the termination of the employment, with claimant establishing July 1
as the latest he would remain. The time fixed by such agreement arrived when a
replacement was obtained and the termination thereupon took place as previously
contemplated by both parties. It is immaterial that claimant was willing to
continue working thereafter, inasmuch as the employer did not abandon the
agreement previously made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We agree with the conclusion of the referee
that claimant suffered his loss of employment by reason of an industrial
controversy in the establishment in which he worked. The conclusion is
inescapable that the walkout in which claimant participated on June 14 was the
direct result of an industrial controversy within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. We are not in accord with the referee’s conclusion
that the certification which claimant made on June 22, 1953 that he was
unemployed on June 19 would be immaterial as not affecting his benefit rights.
The referee reasoned that since this occurred during claimant’s suspension
period due to having lost his employment by reason of an industrial controversy,
claimant’s benefit rights would not be affected. Claimant contested the initial
determination suspending his benefit rights for 49 days. If he were successful
in establishing that his loss of employment was not due to an industrial
controversy he would have been entitled to benefits without suspension. Under
these circumstances he was required to report at the local office in order to
meet the requirements of the statute. Any misstatement made by him during such
period were material to his claim. There is no dispute that the statement
submitted by claimant to the insurance office on June 22, 1953, that he had not
worked on June 19, 1953 was a misstatement and was known to him to be so.
Section 594 of the Unemployment Insurance Law provides for a penalty in the
case of a claimant who has &quot;wilfully made a false statement or
representation to obtain any benefit under the provisions of this
article.&quot; In our opinion, claimant knowingly gave false information as to
a fact, which the Industrial Commissioner was entitled to know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because he was required to work overtime without being compensated therefore,
either in cash wages or compensatory time off. Up to the last six months of his
employment, he was granted compensatory time off for his overtime work.
Thereafter, this was not granted to him due to the pressure of business. He
complained to his supervisor on numerous occasions and was told that these were
the duties of his job. In addition, he was required to work a sixth day when it
was busy at straight time day rate, no matter the number of hours worked. He

was not included in the union contract. Claimant frequently and during the six
months’ period prior to his separation from the employment, was required to
work overtime and more than eight hours a day for which overtime he received no
additional compensation. The employer required it of him as part of his duties
as assistant food and beverage controller. His regular hours of employment were
from 8 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., five days a week. He was on a 37½ hour a week regular
basis. The employer would require such overtime work without compensation in
the future as well. The referee sustained the initial determination of the

vigorously asserts, that the claimant had been promoted to a supervisory

attached to the job were certain added burdens, but this did not change
claimant’s basic status as employee. Section 160 of the Labor Law provides as

illegal, nor does it require compensation to be made therefore unless it was
provided in the contract of employment, But the effect of such a statute is to
release the laborer from the necessity of working in excess of such hours and to
entitle him to his day’s wages at the end of eight hours. The choice rests with
the employee. (<u>McCarthy v. Mayor, etc. of New York</u>, 96 N.Y. 1; cf.&nbsp;<u>People

She worked for an employer located in mid-Manhattan for about six years through
May 15, 1953. In February 1953, the employer changed its business location to
the lower Manhattan area. Travel time thereto from claimant’s home did not
exceed one and one-half hours. On May 15, 1953, claimant voluntarily left her
employment. She submitted a written resignation to the employer, setting forth
that she found it too inconvenient and tiring to commute from her home to the
employer’s new place of business. Claimant filed a claim for benefits,
effective May 25, 1953. On June 1 when interviewed at the local office,
claimant stated in part: &quot;The traveling was tiring and inconvenient to
such an extent that I felt it was affecting my health.&quot; Claimant’s doctor
certified that &quot;patient feels that riding in trains and subways causes her
to have frequent colds due to drafts and temperature changes.&quot; The doctor
further stated that &quot;avoidance of commutation advisable.&quot; On July 13,
1953, claimant was offered employment in her occupation in Yonkers with a
curtain company at $40 a week, which was within the prevailing wage rate.
Claimant refused the employment because she was dissatisfied with the salary
and the starting hour and because she did not like the appearance of the office
of the prospective employer. On August 17, 1953, claimant was offered
employment in her occupation in Yonkers with another curtain company at $42 a
week. She refused the employment because she would have had to join a union in
30 days. She did not wish to pay union dues. The local office issued initial
determinations disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42
consecutive days, effective May 24, 1953, on the ground that she voluntarily
left her employment without good cause, and disqualifying her from receiving
benefits, effective July 13 and August 17, 1953, on the ground that without
good cause, she refused employment on each of those days. Claimant protested
said initial determinations and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determination with respect to voluntary leaving of employment without
good cause. He sustained the initial determination with respect to refusal of
employment without good cause on July 13, 1953, and held that it was
unnecessary to decide whether claimant refused employment without good cause on
August 17, 1953. The Industrial Commissioner appeals to the Board from the
referee’s decision insofar as it overruled the initial determination with
respect to voluntary leaving of employment without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination of voluntary leaving of employment without good cause on the
premise that claimant &quot;left reluctantly and only after the firm had moved
and commutation was such that her health was affected.&quot; We are unable to
agree with his conclusions. There is insufficient proof that claimant was
compelled to leave her job for reasons of health. The most that can be said is
that claimant’s doctor agreed with claimant that she might feel better if she
were not required to commute from her home to her employer’s place of business
in New York City. The same might be said of practically every employed person
who commutes any distance. Claimant testified at the hearing before the referee
that her attendance record with the employer was satisfactory over a prolonged
period and that it was not affected by the employer’s change of business
location. The employer’s representative also testified at the referee’s hearing
that claimant’s work record and attendance were satisfactory, both prior and
subsequent to the employer’s removal to a new address. He expressed his belief
that claimant left her job only because the employer had moved to the downtown
Manhattan area, thus necessitating additional travel time for claimant. The
record shows that claimant’s travel time did not exceed one and one-half hours.
This was not excessive under the Law. Under the circumstances, we are satisfied
that claimant voluntarily left her employment for personal reasons which did
not constitute good cause within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law,
rather than for reasons of health.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is an example. Although claimant’s doctor stated, &quot;avoidance of
commutation advisable,&quot; the Board on careful examination found such
evidence insufficient to prove that claimant was compelled to leave her job for
reasons of health. The countervailing evidence showed that (1) claimant’s
attendance record was satisfactory over a prolonged period, (2) the employer
felt that the claimant left only because of the new location of his establishment
and (3) the most that could be said of the medical evidence is that claimant’s

certified that he agreed with claimant’s suggestion that he might feel better

sufficiency of proof on the basis of the medical certificate when evaluated
with other related evidence. Among those factors which may be taken into
consideration in arriving at a correct conclusion are (1) attendance record,
(2) date medical certificate obtained – see Index 1650-2, (3) reason given to
employer for leaving; transfer possibilities – see Indices 1650-5 and 23, (4)

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a production manager, was employed
by a publisher of a trade paper for 15 years to July 17, 1953. Her terminal
salary was $560 a month. During the last eight years of her employment she
received an annual bonus of $1,000. On or about June 30, 1953, the employer’s
general manager informed claimant that she would receive a bonus as of that
date but that it would thereafter be discontinued. Claimant stated that under
such circumstances she would not continue in her employment. She communicated
with the employer’s president and requested him to rescind the action. He
stated that he was not able to do so. Claimant, accordingly, left her
employment on July 17, 1953. Claimant received a bonus of $1,000 as of June 30,
1953. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective July 27, 1953. Based on an
interview had with claimant and a report received from the employer, the local
office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 consecutive days effective July 27, 1953 on the ground that she
voluntarily left her employment without good cause. Claimant protested the
initial determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determination and the Industrial Commissioner now appeals to the Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

referee, which is based on the conclusion that &quot;claimant had good cause to

evidence does not support such conclusion. It affirmatively appears that there
was no breach by the employer of the terms of employment. Claimant was not
hired with a definite understanding that she would receive an annual bonus as
part of her salary. Although the employer granted claimant an annual bonus
during the last eight years of her employment, it was the employer’s
prerogative to discontinue such bonus in the future if it so believed such
action was indicated. While claimant may have considered the bonus as part of
her salary, she testified at the hearing before the referee that it was
revocable &quot;if business decreased&quot; and that the matter was subject to
the decision of the &quot;Board of Directors.&quot; Such payment hinged upon the
financial condition of the business and discretionary action of the management.
Under all the circumstances herein, we hold that claimant voluntarily left her
employment without god cause within the meaning of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant, her witness and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a dressmaker, filed for benefits
effective June 29, 1953. On October 23, 1953 revised initial determinations
were issued ruling her ineligible during the week ending July 5 because she was
not totally unemployed, ruling her overpaid $30 in benefits for the week ending
July 12 and ruling that the overpayment was recoverable. Claimant was employed
until June 26 when she was laid off because of lack of work. On June 16 three
days earlier than her regular payday, she received a check for the current
week’s wages, plus $35. This payment was made at that time because the employer
was leaving for vacation. Claimant was unaware of the precise nature of the $35
payment, since there was no explanatory information on the pay stub. She
returned to work on July 13 and worked until September 18. She sustained
accidental injuries on September 20 and has been unable to work since then.
Following a report from her employer that she had received $35 vacation pay on
June 16, claimant was interviewed at the insurance office on October 1. At that
time initial determinations were issued ruling her ineligible during the week
ending July 5 because of the receipt of vacation pay, and ruling her overpaid
$30. However, the overpayment was ruled not recoverable because there was no
wilful misrepresentation on claimant’s part. It was noted that she had language
difficulties. On October 13, a determination was issued ruling claimant
ineligible during the week ending July 12 because she &quot;cannot be credited
twice for the same period of employment.&quot; Claimant requested a hearing on
the ground that she was entitled to credit for the week ending July 12.
However, the determinations were apparently rescinded and replaced by the
previously described determinations issued on October 23. The insurance office
records indicate that the denial of waiver of the overpayment was predicated on
claimant’s request for waiting week credit for the same period for which she
had received the benefits, which were deemed overpaid. At the hearing it was
also contended that the overpayment was recoverable because of non-disclosure
on claimant’s part. I find that claimant accepted the benefits for the week
ending July 12 in good faith and that she did not make any false statement or
representation and did not wilfully conceal any pertinent facts in connection
with her claim for benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: As a result of the new
initial determination ruling claimant ineligible in the week ending July 5 the
following statutory week became a waiting instead of a compensable week.
However, claimant’s rights to the benefits already paid to her cannot be
affected by the new initial determination in view of Section 597.4 of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. The credible evidence establishes that claimant
accepted these benefits in good faith and did not make any false statement or
representation and did not make any false statement or representation and did
not wilfully conceal any pertinent facts in connection with her claim for
benefits. The same conclusion was arrived at by the insurance office when
claimant was interviewed on October 1. The diverse rulings made by the
insurance office reflect a reluctance to give credit for the same period for
which claimant received benefits, although a specific ruling to that effect was
retracted. However, there is no basis in the statute for confusing claimant’s
right to accumulate effective days in a period of total unemployment with her
right to retain benefits already paid. The Legislature did not provide, in
enacting Section 597.4, that the retention of benefits under that Section
should have any effect on claimant’s eligibility. Since Section 597.4 refers to
original claims, the waiting week is necessarily involved, with the obvious
result that a new waiting week will have to be served. The Legislature saw fit
not to provide for any correlation between the retention of benefits and the
accumulation of benefit rights during a waiting week. There is no authority for
reading into the statute a provision for offsetting the retained benefits
against a future claim. The initial determination ruling that the overpayment
was recoverable is overruled. The other initial determinations issued on
October 23, remains in effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

duties consisted of enforcing his employer’s rule prohibiting any employee from
leaving the establishment with a package without a pass. During the last two
years of his employment, claimant negligently permitted a number of employees
to carry packages off the premises without a pass. He had been warned about
such conduct several times, but persisted in negligently discharging his duties.
On September 13, he was discharged because of such neglect of duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not of such a wanton and wilful nature as to constitute misconduct within the

by his persistent negligence in performing his duty. He could reasonably
anticipate that his conduct would result in his discharge. His loss of
employment under such circumstances is tantamount to a voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause. The initial determination of misconduct in
connection with the employment is overruled. The alternative initial
determination is sustained. (November 5, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: After a careful review
of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due
deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee’s
findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no
errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact
made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board, except we further
find that the employer operated a club and employed approximately 225
employees; that from time to time property of the employer was reportedly stolen
from its premises; that to prevent such occurrences the employer promulgated
the rule prohibiting employees from carrying packages from its premises without
a pass; that claimant was stationed at the service entrance of the premises and
was employed by the employer to enforce such rule in connection with his other
duties; that claimant persistently neglected to enforce it during the last two
years of his employment although he was repeatedly warned by his supervisor to
insist on its strict compliance and was informed that his omission in that
respect might result in his discharge. The Board is of the opinion that the
referee made proper findings of fact, except as above supplemented. Under all
the facts and circumstances herein, it must be deemed that claimant’s
persistent failure and neglect during the last two years of his employment to
enforce the reasonable rule of the employer and to thereby protect its property
from theft was such a wanton disregard of his employer’s interests as to
constitute misconduct within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. It
seems to us that the protection of the employer’s property from theft was one
of claimant’s most important duties and that he owed a high degree of care to
the employer in that regard, which the credible evidence shows he wilfully,
failed to fulfill. We are satisfied that claimant lost his employment due to
misconduct in connection therewith and that he was properly suspended from
receiving benefits effective September 14, 1953 for a period of seven
consecutive weeks by reason thereof. In view of our decision herein, it is
unnecessary to rule on the alternative initial determination of the local
office which disqualified claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive
days effective September 14, 1953 on the ground that he voluntarily left his
employment without good cause. The initial determination of the local office
suspending the benefit rights of claimant for a period of seven consecutive
weeks effective September 14, 1953 on the ground that he lost his employment
through misconduct in connection therewith, is sustained. The decision of the
referee, insofar as appealed from, is reversed. (December 14, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a knitting instructress, was thus
employed with a retail yarn store in the Bronx for 22 years to May 22, 1953.
Her terminal salary was $76 per week. Due to unfavorable business conditions,
disagreements arose from time to time between the claimant and the employer’s
wife. Such differences were precipitated by remarks of the latter pertaining to
the expense incurred by the firm in operating the instruction department of
which claimant was supervisor. During the final portion of claimant’s
employment, the employer’s wife on several occasions accused claimant of giving
instructions in knitting to persons who were not patrons of the store, which
claimant considered accusations of dishonesty. Following the last of such
accusations she resigned from her position. Claimant filed for benefits
effective May 25, 1953 and registered for employment. On June 19, she refused
employment in her occupation at $60 to $65 for a six-day week because of the
rate and the hours. Claimant was on vacation from June 24 through July 18,
1953. Thereafter, her efforts in search of employment consisted of one or two
personal contacts, resulting in one week of employment commencing September 14,
1953. Claimant left that employment voluntarily and became engaged in
self-employment. Based on interviews with the claimant and a report received
from her previous employer, the local office issued an initial determination
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days
effective May 24, 1953 on the ground that she voluntarily left her employment
without good cause. A second initial determination was issued by the local
office disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits, effective June 19, 1953,
on the ground that, without good cause, she refused employment for which she is
reasonably fitted by training and experience. An initial determination was
issued, in the alternative, holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits,
effective June 19, 1953, on the ground that she was unavailable for employment.
Claimant protested and requested a hearing before a referee. The referee
overruled the initial determination disqualifying her from receiving benefits,
effective June 19, 1953, for refusal of employment. No appeal was taken from
that portion of the referee’s decision. The referee sustained the remaining
initial determinations. Claimant appealed from the portion of the referee’s
decision adverse to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determination pertaining to claimant’s voluntary leaving of her employment,
concluded that the objections which prompted her resignation were personal and
not compelling. We do not subscribe to this view. Ordinarily, incompatibility
existing between an employee and an employer would not be justification for
voluntarily leaving employment, unless it were shown that such differences
impaired the employee’s health. In the instant case, although the latter
element is lacking, we are persuaded that claimant nevertheless was justified
in voluntarily leaving her employment since her honesty and integrity were
impugned. Concededly, claimant was on vacation from June 24 through July 18,
1953 and ineligible to receive benefits for that period. After July 18, 1953
her efforts in search of employment were of a mere token nature. Claimant made
only limited personal contacts in an effort to gain employment during that
period. Her resignation from employment after working only one week, in order
to engage in self-employment, is further evidence of her tenuous attachment to
the labor market at that time. Upon all the facts and circumstances herein, we
are convinced that claimant voluntarily left her employment with good cause but
that she was unavailable for employment commencing June 24, 1953, when she went
on vacation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Board makes the following
additional findings of fact: Prior to November 1952, claimant suffered an
injury to his back which has been diagnosed as the first stage of arthritis in
the lower back. After a hearing held on January 28, 1953 before an referee of
the Workmen's Compensation Board in connection with claimant's claim for
workmen's compensation, the claim was disallowed on the ground that no accident
or occupational condition was established and the matter was closed. On March
6, 1953 the local office issued a revised initial determination disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 days effective December 15, 1952 on the
ground that he voluntarily left his employment without good cause based upon
the premise that claimant's concealment of information in his application for
employment provoked his discharge. The claimant protested and requested a
hearing. The employer contested the determination on the ground that claimant
lost his employment through misconduct in connection therewith. The referee by
decision dated May 15, 1953 sustained the initial determination of voluntary
leaving without good cause. The employer appealed from such decision of the
referee, pursuant to Section 621.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, on the
ground that there were sufficient elements in the case to warrant a decision
based upon misconduct in connection with employment (Appeal Board, 38,343-52).
The Board by order dated July 3, 1953 remanded that case to the referee for the
purpose of holding a hearing&nbsp;<u>de novo</u>&nbsp;on all the issues therein
and rendering a new decision therein. The referee modified the initial
determination of voluntary leaving of employment to hold that claimant's
benefits were suspended for seven weeks effective December 13, 1953 on the
ground that he lost his employment through misconduct in connection therewith
and that claimant was overpaid $116 in benefits. The Industrial Commissioner
appealed from such decision to the Appeal Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This case presents alternative issues to the
Board. The local office has issued an initial determination of voluntary
leaving of employment on the theory that claimant, by falsifying information in
his application blank, provoked his discharge. In view of the&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Baida</u>, which was decided by the Appellate Division, Third Department, on
November 12, 1953, affirming Appeal Board 27,157-51, claimant is not subject to
a disqualification for a provoked discharge. The only question before us,
therefore, is whether or not claimant lost his employment through misconduct in
connection therewith within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law so as
to be subject to the suspension of his benefit rights for seven consecutive
weeks as provided in Section 592.2 thereof. It is undisputed that in order to
obtain employment, which he urgently needed, claimant falsely stated in his
application for employment to his employer that he had never had a back injury
or back ache or a case pending in workmen's compensation. The prejudice
resulting to the employer from this concealment was that it would be subjected
to an additional burden under the Second Injury provisions of the Workmen's
Compensation Law in the event of a future claim by the claimant. Claimant was
discharged for this reason and the employer contends that such concealment and
misrepresentation by the claimant amount to misconduct within the purview of
the Law. The referee in upholding the employer's position, relied on Appeal
Board, 17,420-48 wherein the Board cited with approval the following definition
found in&nbsp;<u>Boynton Cab Co. v. Neubeck</u>, 237 Wis. 249,259:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant's falsification of his application for employment constituted a
deliberate violation of the employer's rules and that by so doing claimant
deliberately committed an act detrimental to the employer's interests so as to
constitute misconduct on his part within the meaning of the Law. While we have
some hesitancy in branding claimant's act as one of misconduct since it was not
wantonly done but committed for the sole purpose of obtaining employment and
motivated by his desire to provide for his family, we are persuaded by the
authorities on this subject in our sister states that the referee's decision
must stand. Under substantially similar statutes in other jurisdictions, it has
been almost uniformly held that a discharge arising out of the deliberate
falsification of an application for employment constitutes misconduct if there
is present injury or prejudice to the employer's interest. (<u>General Motors

for a manufacturer of parachutes in Buffalo, N.Y. for about 2 years to January
1953, earning about $1.60 per hour included incentive bonus. She was laid off
when the factory was closed and filed a claim for benefits, effective February
2, 1953 and registered for employment. Claimant resides in Hamburg, New York.
She has been in this country for four years and has a slight language handicap.
On March 26, 1953, she signed a statement at the local office that she had not
looked for work. Thereafter claimant furnished names of employers whom she had
solicited for employment and she was reinstated in benefits, effective April
13, 1953. On April 30, 1953, claimant was referred to employment by the employment
service as a sewing-machine operator at the guaranteed rate of 85 cents per
hour plus piecework. This referral was in accordance with the employer's job
order on file with the office. Claimant reported to the employer and was
offered the guaranteed rate of 80 cents per hour, plus piece- work to commence
work on May 4. Claimant was unfamiliar with the sewing-machine operation
involved. Claimant did not report for work. The usual hiring rates for
sewing-machine operators in the Buffalo area are from 75 cents to one dollar
per hour, there being a few openings at the latter figure. Claimant desired the
rate of 90 cents per hour. At the hearing before the referee on May 27, 1953,
claimant was re-offered the same employment at the guaranteed rate of 85 cents
per hour, but refused because she still wanted 90 cents per hour. Initial
determinations were issued by the local office (1) holding claimant ineligible
to receive benefits effective March 19, 1953 through April 12, 1953, on the
ground that she was unavailable for employment and (2) disqualifying her from
benefits, effective April 30, 1953, on the ground that she refused employment
without god cause. Claimant protested and requested a hearing. The referee
sustained both determinations and claimant appealed to the Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of her language difficulty, realized the full import of the statement which she
signed on March 26, there is evidence to sustain the referee's ruling that
claimant's efforts to find employment during the first period in question where
so limited as to warrant the determination of unavailability. On the refusal
issue the referee ruled in effect that even though the employer offered
claimant a different rate than that at which she was referred, the
disqualification for refusal was nevertheless proper because the employer's
offer was at a rate not substantially less than that prevailing for similar
work. This decision is contrary to our recent decision in Appeal Board, 38,053-53,

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is a
sewing-machine operator who had been earning $1.60 an hour including an
incentive bonus working on parachutes. Becoming unemployed she applied to the
employment service of the Division of Placement and Unemployment Insurance. She
was referred to an employer by the service and was advised that the job would
pay 85 cents per hour, plus piecework, which is in the nature of an incentive
bonus. When she went to see the prospective employer she was offered 80 center
an hour instead of 85 cents as the basic wage. She refused this offer. The
local office of the Division of Placement and Unemployment Insurance made an
initial determination of disqualification because of this refusal; and on
review the referee sustained the determination. He held that the rate offered
to claimant &quot;though different from the rate stated by the employment
office, was still within prevailing rates for her occupation in the area.&quot;
This determination has been modified by the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board
by reversing that part of it based on the refusal to accept the employment
offered at 80 cents an hour on the ground that claimant was entitled to rely on
the information about the wage furnished by the employment service and not be
required to accept or reject at her peril an offer substantially lower than the
amount offered in the referral. The differential between the offer and the
referral figure seems to us not substantial, but whether it is or not, the
statutory test for disqualification for benefits is something different and
depends on whether the refusal is of a offer &quot;substantially less
favorable&quot; in respect of wages, hours or conditions, than those prevailing
in the locality. (Unemployment Insurance Law [Labor Law, Article 18], §593,
subd. 2 and subd.2 /d/). It is not disputed that 80 cents an hour, as well as
85 cents, was within the prevailing rate for this work in the locality. If
offers are made by employers to applicants referred to them by the employment
service differing from the amount stated in the referral, the service and the
Commissioner have adequate administrative power to act fairly, prevent abuse,
and protect applicants; but an offer coming within the prevailing rate has a
statutory effect which we feel bound to follow. The determination of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board insofar as appealed from should be reversed
and the decision of the referee affirming the initial determination of
disqualification should be reinstated without costs. (April 24, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

important since the Court overruled a line of decisions heretofore rendered by

and that he has good cause to refuse a job offer merely because the wages
actually offered to him, although still within the range of prevailing wages,
are lower than those mentioned by the Employment Service. The Court has now
held that offers by employers at prevailing wages must be judged by themselves
in the light of the statutory provisions, and that the mentioning by the Employment
Service of a rate higher than that actually offered has not bearing on the
disposition of claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a laborer, filed effective November 9, 1953.
By initial determination, he was ruled eligible for benefits without
disqualifying conditions. The employer objected thereto, alleging that claimant
lost his employment because of misconduct in connection therewith, and made the
statutory deposit of $10. When claimant applied for his position, he falsely
denied having worked for the employer before. During his prior employment, he
had a poor attendance record and was afraid that if it became known, he would
not be hired again. The application contained the warning, &quot;it is
understood and agreed that any misrepresentation by me in this application,
will be sufficient cause for cancellation of the application.&quot; When the
employer detected that the application contained a false statement, it
suspended and, eventually, discharged claimant. The last day he worked was
October 2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Motors Corp. v. Appeal Board</u>, Mich. Ct. D MC-140.2-1, BSSUI, (<u>Cir. Ct.
Ingham Co.</u>, 1951).) The instant case comes within this principle. Claimant
lost his employment due to misconduct in connection therewith. The employer's
objections are sustained. The initial determination of eligibility is
overruled. Claimant's benefit rights are subject to suspension for 49 days,
effective October 3, 1953. The employer is entitled to a return of its deposit.

so employed for the past eight years until July 31, 1953 when she lost her
employment by reason of a lack of work. Her terminal salary was $65 per week.
Although employment in the profession of model is seasonal, corresponding with
fluctuations of activity in the garment industry, she assisted other employees
in ticketing garments and folding statements for mailing to customers. With
this minor exception, claimant performed no other services for her employer
during off-season periods. She performed no clerical services for the office
nor did she assist in the sale of merchandise. Claimant is a high school
graduate who specialized in the study of millinery. She has had employment of
approximately one year as an artist's model. Claimant has no history of
employment as a salesperson. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective
August 13, 1953 and registered for employment. She was classified by the
employment service as a model of coats and suits. On November 13, 1953,
claimant was offered and refused to accept referral to temporary employment as
a salesperson in a department store, to last for the duration of the Christmas
shopping season, at a salary of $40 for a five-day , 35½ hour week, with hours
from 9:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. The prospective employer did not require specific
sales experience. Claimant's stated reason for refusing the employment was that
the salary was too low. The offered employment was at wages not substantially
below those which is prevailing for department store clerks in the locality.
Based upon reports from the Prevailing Wage Unit of the Division of Employment,
and from the Employment Service and upon an interview with claimant, the local
office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits effective November 13, 1953 on the ground that, without good cause,
she refused employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training and
experience. Claimant protested the determination and requested a hearing. The
referee sustained the initial determination and claimant has appealed to this
Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant was reasonably fitted by training and experience. Claimant's sole
occupation for at least the past eight years was that of a coat and suit model
and her services were continued by her employer even during normally slow
periods of activity in the industry. She had no previous experience as a
salesperson. The fact that experience was not required by the prospective employer
cannot be decisive on the issue because that is not the test provided by law.
What controls is not the mere ability of the claimant to do the work which is
offered but rather whether the claimant is reasonably fitted therefor by
training and experience. There must be some reasonable relationship between
what's offered and what was previously performed. We are not unmindful that
precise similarity of proffered employment is likewise not required but there
should be some relationship to the employee's experience. The wage offered
claimant was $40 per week. Claimant, in her last employment, earned $65 per
week. The disparity between the wage offered claimant and that which she had
received is so great that she was further justified in refusing the offer, because
it clearly indicated that the offer was outside claimant's classification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a bar cashier, filed an original
claim for benefits effective August 24, 1953 and reported regularly thereafter.
Based on information elicited from the claimant at an insurance interview held
at the local insurance office on November 2, 1953, which indicated a lack of
total unemployment, the local office issued an initial determination holding he
was ineligible to receive benefits effective August 24, 1953 through October
16, 1953, on the ground that he was not totally unemployed and that he was
overpaid $22.50 in benefits. Claimant had been employed by a hotel until August
21, 1953, when he was summarily discharged. He protested the employer's action
to his union and a complaint was filed against the employer charging him with a
wrongful discharge. A demand was made for claimant's reinstatement and the
payment of wages for the intervening period between the wrongful discharge and
reinstatement. The representatives of the parties failed to adjust the
complaint and the matter was submitted to an impartial chairman for
adjudication. A hearing was scheduled for October 7, 1953, and the impartial
chairman adjourned the matter for an informal conference to be held at his
office at 3 p.m. the same day to afford the parties an opportunity to settle
the claim amicably. This meeting culminated in a settlement which was embodied
in a letter agreement providing for a waiver of reinstatement and the payment
of eight weeks salary to claimant as of the payroll week of October 16, 1953.
Shortly thereafter, payroll deductions for social security and the like were
made by the employer and a check for the balance thereof was forwarded to the
claimant. The master union agreement governing the industrial relations between
the hotel association and the union empowered the impartial chairman solely
with the right to order reinstatement with or without back pay. No provision
was made for severance pay. Claimant protested the determination and requested
a hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination and the Industrial
Commissioner now appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee in overruling the initial
determination concluded that the consideration of the settlement represented
dismissal pay and that the situation was no different from that in which
claimant receives damages for breach of a contract of hire. We do not subscribe
to that view. The monies paid by the employer to the claimant were monies paid
to him on account of wages lost for a stipulated portion of time due to his
discharge. Such monies were not a dismissal payment made by the employer. In
prior decisions involving similar circumstances it has been consistently held
that such payments constitute &quot;wages&quot; as defined in the law and the
recipient of benefits in such cases have been deemed to have continued in
employment. This principle has been applied to situations involving the payment
of awards; pursuant to mutual agreement between the parties (<u>Matter of Tonra</u>,
283 N.Y. 186, affirming Appeal Board, 1019-39); pursuant to an order of the
National Labor Relations Board (<u>Matter of Mccoy</u>, 262 App. Div. 790
and&nbsp;<u>Matter of Skutnik</u>, 268 App. Div. 357, affirming Appeal Board,
9623-43); and a consent decree entered in the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals (Appeal Board, 21-38). In a more recent case,&nbsp;<u>Matter of Stewart</u>,
279 App. Div. 500 affirming Appeal Board, 26,776-51, in deciding the benefit
rights of claimants under a similar situation, the Court held &quot;The
receiving of moneys so referable to an on account of wages in employment, even
when the performance of labor therein has been so interrupted, does violence to
the concept of total unemployment as viewed in the declared spirit and purpose
of the Unemployment Insurance Law. (Labor Law, Section 501)&quot; We therefore
hold that the claimant continued in employment during the period in issue and
was not entitled to any benefits received by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant filed for benefits
effective November 30, 1953. By initial determination she was disqualified for
42 days effective November 30, for voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause. In the alternative, her benefits were suspended for seven weeks
effective November 19, for loss of employment because of misconduct in
connection therewith. For three years claimant was employed by a chain of
retail candy stores as a salesperson and manager. She was discharged because
she closed her store before the specified hour. It had come to the employer's
attention that claimant had been in the habit of closing her store before 6
p.m., the specified closing hour. On November 18, the salesmanager visited
claimant's store at 5:40 p.m. and four customers trying to enter and the door
shut. The displays had already been removed from the windows. After the manager
knocked on the door for some time, claimant appeared in her street attire, and
upon investigation, the sales manager found that claimant's money had all been
checked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant may not be
disqualified for voluntary leaving her employment without good cause, since she
was discharged. However, her benefits were correctly suspended for seven weeks
effective November 19, since she lost her employment by actions constituting
misconduct within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Claimant was
aware that she was not to close her store before 6 p.m. Regardless of previous
incidents, there is no question but that on November 18 she failed to keep the
store open until 6 p.m. as required. This was a deliberate violation of an important
company rule, and resulted in serious prejudice to the employer's interests. It
was misconduct in connection with her employment. The initial determination
that claimant voluntarily left her employment without good cause is overruled.
The initial determination that she lost her employment because of misconduct in
connection therewith is sustained. (January 22, 1954).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a jig-builder’s helper, was last
employed at an aircraft factory from December 15, 1951 to April 17, 1953. He
left that employment to enter into business for himself, of a temporary nature,
and for the summer season only. He was opening a luncheonette at Southampton.
He invested approximately $14,000 in this business, and in connection
therewith, obtained a summer license to sell beer. He started the business June
1 and kept it open until September. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
effective October 19, 1953 and registered for employment. On November 4, 1953,
in an interview at the local office, claimant asserted that he quit his job in
April &quot;to go into a summer business selling soda-ice cream-luncheonette
products in Rose Grove, Southampton. ***I opened in early June – I quit April
17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to arrange for opening the business. I closed this
business around the latter part of September. ***I expect to open next Spring.
I am seeking work now ***.&quot; Based on the interview with claimant, the
local office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from
receiving benefits for 42 days effective October 19, 1953, on the ground that
he voluntarily left his employment without good cause. Claimant protested this
determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the determination
and the Industrial Commissioner now appeals to the Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in
overruling the initial determination of the local office, held that a claimant
who leaves a job to go into business for himself quits with good cause within
the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law, citing Appeal Board, 17,480-48.
This conclusion, he said, was fortified by the decision in&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Emery</u>&nbsp;281 App. Div. 426, affirming Appeal board, 30,879-52, holding
that self-employment was equivalent to ordinary employment under the Law. In
numerous cases, the referee added, the Board has held that a worker quit with
good cause to take other employment. We do not believe the&nbsp;<u>Emery</u>&nbsp;case
is determinative of the issue herein, since the court in that case appears to
have passed on the definition of &quot;total unemployment&quot; only and had no
intention of extending its interpretation of the term, &quot;employment&quot;
as used in Section 522 of the Law to other instances where that term appears in
the statute. In this case we find that the claimant left his employment to
enter a business of a temporary nature for the summer season at Southampton. In
Appeal Board, 35,458-52, the Board held that a claimant did not have good cause
for leaving his employment within the meaning of the Law where his
self-employment was of a temporary nature and would terminate by Labor Day. The
Board thus distinguished its prior decision in appeal Board, 17,480-48. See
also, Appeal Board, 42,280-54. We therefore hold that in the instant case the
initial determination was properly issued. The initial determination of the
local office disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 days
effective October 19, 1953, on the ground that he voluntarily left his
employment without good cause, is sustained. The decision of the referee is
reversed. (February 11, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

office manager and accountant. On September 28, 1953, as a result of her own
efforts, she obtained employment as a full-charge bookkeeper at $80 a week with
a manufacturer of zippers. The employer's president told claimant at the time
of her hiring that she was to have full charge of the office and that she was
to perform the duties of a head bookkeeper. Claimant was further informed that
the services of the employer's head bookkeeper were unsatisfactory and that she
was to replace him as soon as she was &quot;broken in&quot; as head bookkeeper.
Claimant, during her first week of employment, was assigned mainly clerical
tasks and incidental bookkeeping duties of a nature usually performed by
assistant bookkeepers. She was not placed in charge of the office. At the end
of the week, claimant told the employer's president that she was leaving
because she had been assigned duties different from those for which she was
hired and because the head bookkeeper was not instructing her in the
performance of those duties. She further stated that the head bookkeeper will
&quot;never give me a chance to be the head bookkeeper.&quot; The employer's
president answered, &quot;I guess that's right,&quot; and he informed claimant
that she had been hired in order to enable the employer to catch up with the
work which claimant had been performing. Claimant thereupon on October 2, left
her employment. She filed a claim for benefits effective October 5, 1953 and
registered for employment. Based upon an interview with claimant and
information from the employer, the local office issued an initial determination
disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days
effective October 5, 1953 on the ground that she voluntarily left her
employment without good cause, in consequence of which she was charged with an
overpayment of $30 in benefits. Claimant protested the initial determination
and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination of the
local office, from which decision the Industrial Commissioner appealed to the
Board. On November 2, 1953, claimant obtained employment in her usual
occupation at $100 a week. She remained in such employment until at least
February 9, 1954.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the duties claimant performed were different from the duties of the job for
which she was hired. This constituted a breach of the employment agreement. She
gave the job a reasonable trial. Her leaving of the employment was with good
cause under the Unemployment Insurance Law.&quot; The employer's president
testified at the hearing before the Board that claimant had been hired to
perform the duties of a head bookkeeper whom she was supposed to replace; that
she had not been afforded the opportunity to perform such duties during the
period of her employment although she was considered by the employer fully
qualified to do so. In point of fact, claimant had been assigned purely
clerical tasks and incidental work of a nature usually performed by assistant
bookkeepers. Under all the facts and circumstances herein, we hold that
claimant's leaving of employment was with good cause. It follows that claimant
was not overpaid in benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant, a witness for and a representative of her employer, and a
representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken.
Claimant, a stenographer-typist, filed for benefits effect December 8, her
benefits were suspended for seven weeks because of loss of employment through misconduct
in connection with her employment. She was also ruled ineligible because of
unavailability for employment effective December 8. Claimant was one of many
persons who comprised her employer's typing pool. On several occasions her
supervisor had returned work to claimant which the supervisor considered
unsatisfactory. On December 7 the supervisor returned some work and reprimanded
claimant because she believed the work was not up to claimant's capability.
Claimant believed the supervisor was prone to fault-finding. She addressed the
supervisor with profanity, in the presence of other coworkers. The incident was
referred to a supervisor, who discharged claimant. Claimant was in an advanced
stage of pregnancy. She expected her child in March and intended to work only
until February 1. Her efforts to secure employment consisted of applying to
several employers in the Bronx, where claimant resides, on December 14.
Thereafter she telephoned an office which specialized in the placement of
temporary office workers. She abandoned all job-seeking efforts by late
December.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

profanity addressed to a supervisor is contrary to the best interests of an

Claimant's loss of employment because of the incident described was due to
misconduct under the Unemployment Insurance Law. Her benefits were accordingly
subject to suspension for the seven-week statutory period. Since claimant
abandoned all job-seeking efforts before the expiration of the seven-week
suspension period, she was unavailable for employment thereafter. The initial
determinations are sustained. (February 10, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A combined hearing was
held at which some of the claimants and representatives of the employer and of
the Industrial Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimants, armature
connectors and winders, were formerly employed by a manufacturer of electrical
motors on the evening shift from 6:00 p.m. to midnight. Except for
claimant&nbsp;<u>Br</u>, they filed for benefits effective July 6, 1953.
Claimant&nbsp;<u>Br</u>&nbsp;filed her claim effective July 13. Each claimant
was declared ineligible by an initial determination for unavailability for
unemployment effective the date of her resignation for benefits. The basis for
the ruling is that claimants restrict their availability to work from 6:0 p.m. to
midnight and there is no reasonable opportunity of their finding such
employment. It is also alleged that they did not make an active search for
employment. Claimants are unwilling to work before 6:00 p.m. because they have
young children. They are able to work from 6:00 p.m. to midnight because at
that time their husbands are at home. During the day, claimants are generally
without transportation, since their husbands use the single-family automobile
for travel to work. On July 2 there was a general layoff at claimant's factory
for lack of work, and while the employer at that time expected to recall
claimants in or about the month of October, he testified at the hearing that he
had not as yet obtained any contracts for work and could not predict when claimants
would return to work. In claimants' community there have been, from time to
time, a few factories employing women on the shift from 6:00 p.m. to midnight,
but since at least July, there has not been any opportunity for claimants to
work. Claimants are seeking factory work within a reasonable distance of their
homes and they are not willing to do waitress work or work of that nature. They
formerly earned $1.35 an hour and while they would be willing to work for $1 an
hour, they have no desire to work for 75 cents an hour, the rate generally paid
for unskilled work in the area. Until claimants were interviewed in or about
the middle of July, they had not looked for work anywhere. Subsequently, they
made some inquiries, but their search for employment has been hampered because
of their lack of transportation and the scarcity of factories employing women
during the hours that they can work. A few factories employ women on a full
eight-hour shift to midnight and many factories employ only men on the last shift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In order to be eligible for benefits a
claimant must be available for employment which has been defined as a
readiness, willingness, and ability to work. But that is not the sole test. If
restrictions and conditions are imposed, such as the hours during which a
claimant can work, then it must first be determined whether the restrictions
are reasonable, and secondly whether after taking into consideration such
restrictions, a fair and reasonable prospect of securing employment remains. I
have no doubt that claimants are ready, willing and able to work, and if the
opportunity presented itself of obtaining a factory job from 6:00 p.m. to
midnight at $1 an hour within a reasonable distance of their homes that they
would accept such jobs. However, the possibility of such opportunity arising is
too remote that to all intents and purposes it does not exist. The
circumstances which required claimants to work from 6:00 p.m. to midnight are
compelling considering the fact that they have young children. Claimants have
not made an active search for work, but that perhaps may be explained by the
lack of places to which they can apply. However, since they have been
unemployed for two months and there appears to be little or no prospect at this
time that they will become employed again, they are ineligible for benefits.
The respective initial determinations are sustained. (9/1/53)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

testimony and evidence adduced before the referee and before the Board, and due
deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee's
findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the referee as the findings of
fact and conclusions of law of this Board, except that we make the following
additional findings of fact: The evidence produced at the hearing before the
Board disclosed that there were no jobs to be had during the months of July,
August and part of September, 1953 in Rockland County in factories, which
operated night shifts for women, between the hours of 6 and 12 p.m. Although
there were some factories or establishments which did operate night shifts for
women during these months in the adjoining Bergen County, the distance from
claimants' place of residence to those establishments was so great and the rate
of pay and number of hours of employment, which were available were so small,
that claimants found it unprofitable to accept such employment. There were
several newspaper advertisements for factory jobs for women during night shifts
in Bergen County, but claimants were unwilling to accept these jobs and did not
apply for them. The Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings
of fact and correctly determined the issue involved in this case, except as
above stated. The decision of the referee is affirmed. (3/5/54)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, an assistant buyer, filed for benefits effective April 21,
1952. By initial determination effective August 18 she was disqualified for
refusal of employment without good cause and in the alternative ruled
ineligible because of unavailability for employment. She was ruled overpaid
$150. The initial determination was sustained in Case 544-1168-52R with leave
given to claimant to apply to reopen the case upon giving satisfactory
explanation for the default. She contended she did not attend that hearing on
December 31, 1952 because she did not receive notice of the hearing; further
that she did not receive notice of the decision. She applied to reopen the case
February 18, 1954. This was the first time she had been in the insurance office
since October, 1952. The notice of the December 31, 1952 hearing and notice of
the decision were correctly addressed to claimant. These notices were not
returned to the Referee Section. Claimant was unable to explain their
non-delivery. She does not recall that other mail went astray during this
period. On August 14, 1952, a former employer wrote to claimant and requested
her to communicate with it at her earliest convenience &quot;for an
interview.&quot; The letter further stated that, &quot;We would like to see you
in reference to an opportunity for employment.&quot; Claimant contended that in
some fashion this letter was delivered by the postman so that it lay unnoticed
by her for several weeks. When she finally discovered the letter, she
telephoned the employer sometime in September and was interviewed a week later.
There was then no job available for her. According to the employer, she would
have been offered employment as an assistant buyer at $60 a week. It was
contended that claimant's efforts to find work were not diligent. She was
interviewed at the insurance office September 26 and September 29, at which
time she listed some contacts for employment. She contended that as she was
seeking an executive position she could not be too aggressive in making
employer contacts. She became employed October 6.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The Commissioner's
representative opposed claimant's application to reopen Case 544-1168-52R, on
the ground that claimant unreasonably delayed in making such application. He
contended that because of such delay he was unable to present evidence and
witnesses with reference to the issues and was unable to question claimant with
respect to her availability for employment because the lapse of time made it
unreasonable to expect that claimant would recall details of her search for
work. This position is well taken. Interrogation as to the refusal of employment
issue was not hampered by the lapse of time involved but if was difficult to
question claimant concerning her availability. Her failure to promptly respond
to the communication of her former employer was some indication that she was
not ready, willing and able to work during the period in issue. Claimant's
contention with respect to the non-delivery of the various notices is rejected.
Had those notices not been delivered to the addressee they would have been
returned by the post office. Under the circumstances, claimant's application to
reopen the default is denied. The initial determinations remain in effect.
Claimant was overpaid. (March 17, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Board thereupon determined to hold a further hearing for the purpose of
considering said application and for the taking of such additional proof as
might be offered. The matter first came on to be heard before the Board on
March 2, 1954 after all parties appeared and were accorded a full opportunity

"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant, a packer of garments in the
men's clothing industry in New York City for about 20 years, lost his
employment on March 27, 1953 because of lack of work. He filed a claim for
benefits effective April 27, 1953 and registered for employment. He is a member
of the A. union and has earned between $60 and $70 weekly. The men's clothing
industry in claimant's locality is highly unionized. The months of June and
July are usually a slow season in this industry and activity usually increases
towards the latter part of July or the beginning of August. On June 26, 1953,
claimant was offered employment as a packer of ladies' garments at a salary of
$50 for a 40-hour week. Claimant refused the employment because he claimed that
the salary was insufficient and also because he did not have any experience as
a packer of ladies' coats. In his area most packers in claimant's
classification earn between $1 and $1.35 an hour. In March 1950, claimant was
employed as a packer by a firm selling both ladies' and men's garments. The
constitution of claimant's union (Article 9, Section 3) provides for summary
suspension pending the filing of charges and hearing of any member who becomes
a member of any other labor organization. Claimant would not have been required
to join any other union as a condition of accepting the proffered employment.
The constitution places no restriction upon engaging in occupations outside the
men's clothing industry. Claimant, had he accepted the proffered employment,
might have continued as a member in good standing of A. union provided he
continued to pay dues. Packers in the ladies' garment industry were not then
organized by any union. Members of claimant's union enjoy the privilege of
paid-up group life insurance in the amount of $500, disability insurance in the
amount of $20 per week for a period of 13 weeks in any calendar year,
hospitalization and surgical benefits in accordance with a schedule of
allowances and a retirement benefit of $50 per month upon attaining the age of
65 or in case of total disability. If a member accepts employment outside of
the men's clothing industry, it is provided that hospitalization, surgical and
disability benefits are to cease immediately (Handbook of Information on Life,
Accident and Sickness Insurance, Section VIII). In such event, group life
insurance protection continues for a period of six months after which it is
automatically terminated (Handbook, Section XI). Such protection may be
continued after termination of an individual coverage basis without medical
examination at a premium based upon the attained age of the insured (Handbook,
Section XII). This privilege of continuing coverage on an individual basis
after termination does not extend to hospitalization, surgical or disability
benefits. All forms of insurance inuring to the benefit of union members are
reinstated after return to the clothing industry and continuous employment therein
for six months by a contributing employer (Handbook, Section XIII). With
respect to retirement benefits, it is provided that eligibility therefor is
conditioned upon continuous employment in men's clothing industry for at least
20 years and employment therein for at least two years immediately preceding
the date of application with an who is a contributor to the Retirement Fund.
Employment is deemed continuous as to duration if it consists of at least 26
weeks during each calendar year. There is also a requirement of 10 years
continuous membership in the union immediately preceding the date of
application. All rights to retirement benefits are deemed forfeited in the
event the union member leaves the industry for any other type of employment and
is so engaged for a period of 24 consecutive months (Pamphlet, Information
Regarding Retirement Benefits, Section A,B,F).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;The employment offered claimant was one
for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience. Precision in the
matching of skills is not required. There was a reasonable relationship between
what was offered claimant and the work he previously performed. The wages were
not substantially less favorable to claimant than those which prevailed in the
locality for similar work. An occupational wage survey of average hourly
earnings for selected occupations reported by the United States Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for the New York City area under date of
February 19, 1953 discloses that of 5,181 persons employed in claimant's job
classification, 2,741 earned between $1 and $1.35 per hour, and 1,851 earned
between $1.35 and $1.70 per hour. Of the total, 1,796 earned less than $1.25 an
hour. The offer of employment was made at a time when to the knowledge of
claimant and based upon his previous experience, employment in his own industry
was virtually impossible to obtain. A union representative who was called to
testify in behalf of claimant stated that there were no jobs available for
claimant in the men's industry at the time of the job offer. Under these
circumstances, claimant refused employment without good cause within the
meaning of the Law, unless the refusal may be excused on the ground that
acceptance of the proffered employment would have affected claimant's retention
of his union membership. Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 593, subdivision 2
provides&nbsp;<u>inter alia</u>&nbsp;as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>No
refusal to accept employment shall be deemed without good cause nor shall it
disqualify any claimant otherwise eligible to receive benefits if acceptance of
such employment would either require the claimant to join a company union or
would interfere with his joining or retaining membership in any labor
organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant was not
required to join a union in order to accept the employment. It is also clear
that acceptance of the proffered employment would not have affected claimant's
existing union membership per se as distinguished from the incidental
privileges attaching to union membership. Acceptance of the proffered
employment would have entailed nothing more than the loss of hospitalization
and surgical benefits for which claimant could re-qualify upon returning to his
former industry. Disability benefits provided by the union are an alternative
to those under the Workmen's Compensation Law so that no substantial loss in
this regard would have resulted from accepting the employment. Life insurance protection
did not cease automatically but continued in force for a period of six months
after the acceptance of employment in another industry. Retirement benefits
remained unaffected so long as claimant had 26 weeks of employment with an
employer who is a contributor to the fund, during the calendar year for the
period of time specified. The complete loss of retirement benefits could be
occasioned only by employment in some other industry for a consecutive period
of 24 months. Thus, it is clear that material prejudice to claimant was
unlikely since the offer of employment was made during a period of diminished
activity in claimant's industry and he was free to return thereto with the
resumption of greater activity therein. The interference with claimant's membership
benefits (as distinguished from membership itself) which the acceptance of the
proffered employment would entail would at the very worst have been a
relatively minor character. In any event, it cannot be said that acceptance of
the proffered employment would have interfered with claimant's retention of
membership in a labor organization within the scope and intent of the
Unemployment Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

operator, filed for benefits effective November 23, 1953. By initial
determination effective January 11, 1954, her benefits were suspended for seven
weeks because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which she
was employer and she was ruled overpaid $26. Claimant last worked for a
manufacturer and contractor on handkerchiefs, on or about December 28, 1953.
Her employer then had no more work for her. It had been slow for some time.
Claimant and co-workers were called to the employer's establishment on January
11, 1954 and asked if they would perform work at a rate below that provided in
a union agreement. Claimant and her co-workers refused to work below the
contract rate. The employer thereupon did not accept the work which he had in
mind at the cut rate. Acceptance of the work below the union rate would have
subjected the workers to disciplinary action by their union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due
deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee's
findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no
errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact
made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board, except that we find
that the employees of the establishment, with the consent of the executive
board of their union local, may agree to work for less than the piecework rates
stipulated in the existing union agreement. The claimant and her co-workers
acting in concert on January 11, 1954, rejected the employer's offer of renewed
employment at lower piecework rates and as a result thereof, the employer was
compelled to withdraw from production the material on which the claimant and
the other employees in the establishment refused to work unless paid the union
contract piecework rates for such work. The action of the claimant and the
other employees was approved by their union. Although we have adopted the
findings of fact of the referee, except as hereinabove stated, we do not agree
with the conclusion reached by him that the claimant did not lose her
employment because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which
she was employed. We are of the opinion that the claimant's unemployment
subsequent to January 11, 1954, was the direct result of an industrial
controversy within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Claimant and
her co-employees resisted the employer's demand for a modification of the
piecework rates in the establishment. In order to compel the employer to
rescind his offer of lower piecework rates and to restore the former rates, all
of the production employees in the establishment, including claimant, engaged
in concerted action in rejecting the employer's offer of work when they walked
out of their place of employment. Their position in the dispute with the
employer was approved by their union. The initial determination of the local
office suspending the accumulation of benefit rights by the claimant for seven
consecutive weeks effective January 11, 1954, on the ground that she lost her
employment because of a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the
establishment in which she was employed and that she was overpaid $26 In
benefits, is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (April 15,

which claimant and representatives of the employer and Industrial Commissioner
appeared and testified. Claimant, a telephone operator, filed a claim for
benefits effective November 23, 1953. By initial determination claimant was
disqualified for 42 consecutive days from that date because of voluntary
leaving of employment without good cause. Claimant resides in Bethpage. She was
employed from October 13 to November 19, 1953, by a title insurance company in
Manhattan at $65 a week. She left that employment because she had been hired by
an aircraft company at Farmingdale, Long Island as a typist at $61.20 to start,
subject to a physical examination. On Saturday, November 14, claimant went to
the aircraft company and applied for a job. She was given a test and qualified
for the position of typist. After filling out various papers, claimant was
requested to wait for a physical examination. Because of the congestion, she could
not be examined that day and an appointment was made to examiner her the
following Saturday, November 21. Claimant came to the plant on November 21 for
the examination but then learned that the employer's records indicated that he
was required to report for the examination on November 16 and that she had not
done so. In the meanwhile, the position had been filled prior to November 21.
Claimant denied that she was required to report on November 16. She told her
employer that she was leaving the job because of illness. She admits that
reason was false, but gave that as the reason for quitting because she had been
recommended on the job with the title insurance company by a friend of the
president of the company and, in view of her short period of employment there,
did not wish to embarrass him by stating the true reason for quitting. Claimant
was subsequently employed in Long Island from January 11, 1954 to February 12.

ruled in numerous cases that a claimant who leaves employment without any
definite job to go to quits without good cause within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. In this case, the record indicates that claimant quit with the
understanding that she had a job to go to. She had been tested by the
prospective employer and found acceptable and all that remained was to comply
with the company policy which required her to be examined by a physician.
Because of the confusion in the date of examination, claimant reported late for
that examination and when she did so learned that the job had already been
filled. The initial determination is overruled. (February 24, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;After a careful
review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and
due deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee's
findings of facts are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no
errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact
made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board, except that we find
that claimant had no definite prospect of other employment at the time of her
voluntary leaving of employment. Although claimant had filed an application for
employment with a prospective employer, she had been required to report on
November 16, 1953 for a physical examination, which was a condition of her
hiring. Claimant failed to comply with such requirement and, consequently, she
was not hired by the prospective employer. Inasmuch as it appears that claimant
had no definite prospect of other employment at the time of her voluntary
leaving of employment, such leaving was without good cause under the
Unemployment Insurance Law. As the referee stated in his opinion, the Appeal
Board has ruled in numerous cases that a claimant who leaves employment without
any definite job to go to quits without good cause within the meaning of the
Law. The referee overruled the initial determination of the local office based
on the premise that when claimant left her employment she understood she
&quot;had a job to go to.&quot; We do not concur with the result reached by the
referee. The credible evidence shows that at the time of her voluntary leaving
of employment, claimant had merely a hope or expectancy of obtaining other
employment, which did not materialize into employment because of her failure to
report on November 16, 1953 for a physical examination as required by the
prospective employer. She knew that a satisfactory physical examination was a
prerequisite to her prospective employment. Claimant was not justified in
voluntarily and prematurely leaving her employment based on a mere hope or
expectancy of obtaining other employment. We have repeatedly held that this is
not the test fixed by the Law. Claimant did not act as a reasonably prudent
person should have acted under like circumstances. Under all the circumstances
present in this case, we hold that claimant voluntarily left her employment
without good cause within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The
initial determination of the local office disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits for 42 consecutive days effective November 23, 1953 on the ground that
she voluntarily left her employment without good cause is sustained. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (April 9, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

November 20, 1953 as a taxicab driver. On November 20, 1953, in responding to a
call to pick up a fare, consisting of a mother and two children, claimant told
the mother that one of the children would not be permitted to use the seat of
the cab because the child's clothing was soiled and would damage the
upholstery. When the mother insisted that the child use the seat of the
taxicab, claimant refused to accept her as a passenger. Claimant felt that had
he permitted the child to sit on the seat, it might subject the employer to a
damage suit by a future passenger who might use the same seat. After leaving
the address of the passenger claimant explained the situation to the employer
through the inter-communication telephone. The employer instructed claimant to
return to the address of the passenger and pick up the fare, stating that it
was not claimant's prerogative to determine the type of passengers that would
be permitted to ride in the taxicab. When claimant refused to comply with the employer's
request, he was ordered to return the taxicab and he was discharged forthwith.
Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective November 23, 1953 and registered
for employment. Based on the foregoing, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 days
effective November 23, 1953 on the ground that he voluntarily left his
employment without good cause. Claimant contested the determination and
requested a hearing. At the hearing an alternative determination was added
suspending the accumulation of benefit rights by claimant for seven consecutive
weeks effective November 21, 1953 on the ground that he lost his employment
through misconduct in connection with his employment. The referee overruled the
initial determination and the alternative determination. The Industrial
Commissioner appealed to this Board from the referee's decision insofar as it
overruled the alternative determination of misconduct added at the hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

accept the fare because he was acting in furtherance of the employer's best
interests. However, after he reported the circumstances to the employer, he had
complied with the obligations he believed he had as an employee. Any damage
resulting to the taxicab or claim by another passenger thereafter because of
the condition of the child would have knowingly been assumed by the employer.
Claimant lost his employment because he refused to comply with a direct order
from his employer, compliance with which would have resulted in no detriment to
claimant. Under the circumstances, claimant's act was adverse to the employer's

November 14, by two employers engaged in the manufacturing of equipment. One
was a partnership and the other a corporation. They were under common control
and claimant worked during both periods under the supervision of the same
foreman, performing the same tasks at the same location. Both employers are
designated as &quot;the employer&quot; in a collective bargaining agreement as
the party of the first part. According to the agreement, employees must join
the union within 60 days after being hired. Claimant quit the job on June 13.
When he was rehired, at his request on October 7 he was informed that his prior
employment was part of his trial period and that he must join the union.
Claimant promised the shop steward that he would join but never paid the shop
steward. At the end of the 70 days claimant was separated from his employment
because of his failure to join the union. Claimant contended that he meant to
join the union but he lacked the required funds. The union initiation was $25 a
month and the dues were $3 a month. Arrangements had been made for claimant to

the employee not to meet a condition of the work. The refusal to pay a bus fare
to get to work on time in the fact of a foreseeable discharge; or to get tools,
clothing or equipment where they were required as the employee's part of the
agreement; or to secure needed technical preparation to continue the work,
where it was open to the employee to do any of these things or not, would be
treated as &quot;voluntary&quot; separations if they had the result of ending
the employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after a probation period in the work to obtain union membership required by the
labor agreement with the employer. This, in our view, is such a voluntary
separation from employment that the Industrial Commissioner was right in
holding that claimant is not entitled to benefits under the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an employee must join the International Association of Machinists. Claimant,
who is an assembly hand, first was hired from April 30, 1953 to June 13, 1953
when he left the employment; and was rehired on October 7, 1953. The employers
were dual, but their integration was such that the Board treated them as a
single employer and we treat them the same way. Failing to join the union,
although arrangements had been made for installment payment of an initiation
fee of $25, he was &quot;removed at the request of the union&quot; on November
4, 1953. He was given a &quot;ten-day notice&quot; by the union after the
60-day period of total employment had expired which was in accordance with
union practice. The shop steward testified: If he doe not join in the ten days
he must go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this appeal that there were two separate employment, one in April and the other

of the union was not a voluntary separation, still neither of the two periods
separately considered amounted to a long enough probation period to total 60
days and to give a right under the labor agreement to require the termination
of employment, and that therefore the demand of the shop steward and the
acquiescence of the employers were a mistaken interpretation of the agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

done. The argument of claimant that he offered to pay the union his entrance

employment at a stated date in the future and on receipt of the notice, but
before the date had arrived, claimant was discharged. We hold that this
discharge, effective as it was before the time of the announced resignation,
was not a voluntary separation from employment and the words of the Court's
decision were carefully limited. A penalty of disqualification, it was there
stated, does not occur &quot;for provoking a discharge by giving a notice of
resignation.&quot; Here we are dealing with a discharge arising from the acts
of the employee which left the employer no other choice than to separate him
from employment. And the two situations in their consequences on the right to
unemployment insurance benefits we treat as being different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there refused to join the union having a collective bargaining agreement with

market from October 15, 1953 to January 3, 1954. The original initial
determination that she was to be re-employed after a leave of absence and was
therefore entitled to unemployment insurance benefits was correct. The employer
may have had good reasons not to permit her to return to work when her leave of
absence expired, but she did not voluntarily leave her employment. The
relationship of employer and employee continued until the expiration of her
leave. The initial determination is overruled. (February 17, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in this case, and that no errors of fact appear to have been made, the Board
adopts the findings of facts made by the referee as the findings of the fact of
this Board, except that we find that evidence now before the Board shows that
claimant was not granted a leave of absence, but was advised that if work were
available when she applied for re-employment, she would be rehired. The Board
is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact in this case,
except as stated above. We do not agree with the referee's conclusion that
claimant obtained a leave of absence. Claimant's termination of employment was
of her own volition. She could have remained in the employment had she chosen.
For the reasons stated claimant was properly disqualified from receiving
benefits. The revised initial determination of the local office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days effective January 11,
1954, on the ground that she voluntarily left her employment without good cause
is sustained. The decision of the referee is reversed. (April 23, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant, and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner and of the
employer appeared and testified. Claimant, a clerk, filed for benefits
effective February 8, 1954. By initial determination effective the same date,
she was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of employment without
good cause. Claimant was last employed by the same firm for about two and a
half years until February 5. Her hours of work were 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For
sometime prior to February 5, the employer was contemplating discharging
claimant because of a personality clash between claimant and her supervisor. On
February 2, claimant was granted a $2 pay increase, which was less that the
amount which she anticipated when she requested a raise. She complained to her
employer about the insufficiency of the raise and stated that she intended to
resign at the end of the workday, on Friday, February 5. However, at about 11
a.m. on February 5, claimant informed her employer that she had changed her
mind about resigning and desired to continue on the job. The employer thereupon
discharged the claimant and gave her three weeks severance pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant's employment
was not terminated by a voluntary leaving on her part. On the contrary, her
employment terminated because she was discharged by her employer. Consequently,
she may not be disqualified on the ground that she left her employment without
good cause. (<u>Matter of Baida</u>, 282 App. Div. 975, affirming Appeal Board,
27,157-1). Claimant had made it clear to the employer early in the day on
February 5, that she intended to remain in the employment. It was the employer
who was unwilling to have her do so, and discharged her. The initial
determination is overruled. (April 1, 1954)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the
referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of this Board, except
that we find that claimant, on February 2, 1954, gave her employer definite
notice that she would leave her employment on February 8, 1954, and the employer,
at such time accepted her resignation; that before claimant reconsidered her
resignation the employer had hired her replacement; that in accordance with
said notice, the services of claimant were terminated on said date, and that
claimant voluntarily left said employment for reasons not deemed to be good
cause within the purview of the Unemployment Insurance Law. The Board is of the
opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and correctly determined
the issue involved in this case, except as above stated. The employer's failure
to permit claimant to withdraw her resignation which had already been accepted,
cannot be considered a discharge under the circumstances of this case. The
