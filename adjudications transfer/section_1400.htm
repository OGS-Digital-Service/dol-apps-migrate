<P><center><big><b>1400. <U>Introduction</U> </b></big></center></P>
<P>It is axiomatic that unemployment insurance benefits are to be paid only to the unemployed. In setting forth public policy at the time of enactment of the Unemployment Insurance Law, the Legislature declared that the "public good and well-being of the wage earners of this state require the enactment of this measure for the compulsory setting aside of financial reserves for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own." (Labor Law, sec. 501) </P>
<P>The Law provides that "Benefits shall be paid only to a claimant who is totally unemployed..." (sub. sec. 591.1). Total unemployment is defined as the total lack of any employment on any day. The term 'employment' as used in this section means any employment including that not defined in this article." (sec. 522) </P>
<P>Accordingly, it is incumbent upon local offices, guided by Appeal Board and court precedents, to determine whether a particular claimant is engaged in "any employment." </P>
<P>The issue of total unemployment is often one of the most difficult facing claims personnel. A claimant who performs services for an employer under a contract of hire and receives remuneration therefor is clearly not "totally unemployed." However, local offices must often determine whether a claimant who performs some services, but receives no remuneration, or receives some remuneration but performs no services, or has chosen to temporarily suspend the activities of a self-employment enterprise or of a corporation in which (s)he is a principal, lacks total unemployment; and, if so, whether the claimant is continually employed or employed only during certain periods. This requires a careful examination of all the circumstances surrounding the claimant's "unemployment." </P>
<P>When interviewing claimants regarding total unemployment, claims personnel should consult the appropriate Fact-Finding Guidecards for a checklist of questions to be explored. Determinations should be made in accordance with the principles reported in this section of the Interpretation Service Index, and the policies set forth in relevant Special Bulletins (A-710 series) and Field Memoranda. </P>

<li><U>Days of rest </U></li><br><br>
<ol type="1">
<li>A claimant is totally unemployed on Sundays, holidays and other days of rest scheduled by his employer, even if an employer-employee relationship exists on such days, provided he does not work on such days and they are not days of paid vacation or other paid leave. (Administrative Interpretation 7-1, 12 NYCRR 490.5) </li></ol><br><br>
<a name="1410B"></a>
<li><U>Leave of absence </U></li><br><br>
<ol type="1">
<li>A State employee, in the same manner as any other employee, is totally unemployed (Section 522) when on an unpaid leave or absence. (Ref. 545-150-53R; <a href="12.htm#1218">A-750-1218</a>) </li>
</ol><br><br>
<a name="1410C"></a>
<li><U>Statutory limit on earnings </U></li><br><br>
<ol type="1">
<li>A claimant who deliberately foregoes the opportunity of earning additional wages during the balance of his last day of employment to keep within the statutory limitation for partial unemployment benefits, places himself without the scope or the provisions authorizing the payment of partial benefits and hence renders himself ineligible for benefits in that week. (A.B. 73,779-60; <a href="15.htm#1527">A-750-1527</a>; similarly, A.B. 94,506-62) </li><br><br>
<li>Vacation pay is not considered in determining the statutory limitation for partial unemployment benefits (Section 523). (This principle also applies to holiday pay). (A.B. 107,744; <a href="16.htm#1603">A-750-1603</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Where, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement governing the industry, claimants receive stamps representing six per cent of their wages, redeemable in cash from the union vacation pay fund, such stamps represent vacation pay and cannot be used in determining the statutory limitation for partial unemployment benefits. (A.B. 124,517; <a href="16.htm#1646">A-750-1646</a>). </li>
</ol><br><br>

<ol type="1">
<li> In determining "effective days" under Section 523 of the Law, all employment must be considered, including that not covered by the New York State Unemployment Insurance Law, such as railroad work. (A.B. 61,220-57; <a href="14.htm#1469">A-750-1469</a>)</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Claimant who assisted wife in the performance of her duties as superintendent for which the couple received $10 to $20 per month and the use of an apartment valued at $35 per month, such claimant was not totally unemployed; for under the ruling in Appeal Board Case 148-38, claimant assisting wife in performance of her duties as superintendent with knowledge of employer was employed by employer and thus not totally unemployed. (Ref. Dec. 576-6-39R) </li><br><br>
<li>Where claimant and his wife undertook janitorial duties in connection with a fifteen family apartment building at a compensation of $40 per month plus a three-room apartment, with the understanding that such duties were not to interfere with the husband's employability elsewhere, claimant was held to be totally unemployed since the janitorial services were rendered almost exclusively by his wife, except for not in excess of one hour of work a day which did or would not interfere with other employment. (The Board held that the wife was the employee and the husband's work was the result of the family relationship) (A.B. 15,260-47; <a href="08.htm#818">A-750-818</a>). </li><br><br></ol>

<ol type="1">
<li>Substantial activity in preparing for commencement of business may indicate not only unavailability but also lack of total unemployment, even though the venture is abandoned before it becomes operative. (A.B. 148,052; <a href="17.htm#1708">A-750-1708</a>; see Comments) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant is engaged in self-employment and therefore ineligible for benefits because he is not totally unemployed within the meaning of that term as defined by Section 522 of the Law when he devotes substantial time to a business in which he has a proprietary interest. <U>(Matter of Emery, </U>281 App. Div. 2d 426; <a href="12.htm#1207">A-750-1207</a>; see comments) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who works in his own business (3 to 4 hours on each of 3 to 4 nights weekly) is self-employed and therefore not totally unemployed, and it is irrelevant that this work in his own business does not interfere with his seeking or accepting full-time employment for wages. <U>(Matter of Schreiber, </U>5 A.D. 2d 745; <a href="14.htm#1471">A-750-1471</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who, while employed, had acquired an interest in a business venture involving a nominal investment and a negligible amount of his time and who could accept regular full-time employment in his usual occupation without prejudicing his interest in the venture, was totally unemployed and available for employment. (A.B. 615-39) </li><br><br>
<li>The ownership of income-producing real estate did not necessarily constitute self-employment, and a person who was in fact available for regular employment such as he had in the past, received benefits although he devoted some time to preservation of his investments. (A.B. 1827-39; <a href="00.htm#68">A-750-68</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who rents some rooms in her home is not engaged in the rooming house business and, therefore, not engaged in self-employment when, in connection therewith, she only performs the normal household duties of any housewife who is gainfully employed during the daytime. (A.B. 38,226-53; <a href="12.htm#1213">A-750-1213</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Where the operation of a rooming house is for the purpose of gaining a livelihood rather than being a mere subordinate addition to claimant's household, such activity renders claimant self-employed and, therefore, not totally unemployed. (A.B. 45,299-54; <a href="13.htm#1327">A-750-1327</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who owns and devotes substantial time to the operations of his farm on a continuous basis is self-employed and therefore not totally unemployed at all times, even though he has periods of full time employment elsewhere. (A.B. 305,280; <a href="19.htm#1900">A-750-1900)</a> </li><br><br>
<li>Claimant is not totally unemployed when he assumes full responsibility for the operation of his farm (250 acres; about 40 cows) and devotes thereto a substantial portion of his time (four or five hours daily). (A.B. UCFE-243-58; <a href="14.htm#1492">A-750-1492</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Claimant, a full-time factory worker, who during hours when not so employed performs occasional work as a beautician at home by appointments, is self-employed but only on those specific days when actually engaged in such work. (A.B. 67,996-59; <a href="15.htm#1513">A-750-1513</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Claimant, a freelance business consultant, who advertised in a trade publication, maintained an office and storage space, and had a telephone answering service with a listing in the telephone directory, was not totally unemployed notwithstanding that the business was merely a sideline while regularly employed, was sporadic, involved limited investment and was not remunerative during the period for which benefits were claimed. <U>(Matter of Carasso; </U>23 A.D. 2d 935; <a href="16.htm#1638">A-750-1638</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Claimant who is self-employed in a substantial continuous business, (mason contractor) is not totally unemployed during a slack period when no active operations are performed and during which time he continued to promote the interest of his business. (Operations ceased during the winter months because of inclement weather and claimant sought but was unable to procure inside jobs.) (A.B. 81,513-61; <a href="15.htm#1558">A-750-1558</a>; similarly. A.B. 90,819-62; A.B. 119,728) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who devotes evening hours to running a gift shop is self-employed and ineligible for benefits because of lack of total unemployment. (A.B. 44,313) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant may be totally unemployed despite assisting his/her spouse, a Family Care Provider, by sharing in domestic chores and lending a helping hand to the residents in their home as a matter of common courtesy. (A.B. 405,115; <a href="20.htm#2037">A-750-2037</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>Although exploring the possibility of opening a business, a claimant is totally unemployed provided there is no financial commitment to the business venture nor is substantial time or effort devoted to preparing for it. (A.B. 423,599; <a href="20.htm#2064">A-750-2064</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant lacks total unemployment during the period he/she is performing substantial activities, including efforts to obtain the licenses necessary to establish a business and committing money to the venture. (A.B. 413,557; <a href="20.htm#2065">A-750-2065</a>) </li><br><br>
<li>A claimant who is actively engaged in operating a website business offering merchandise for sale lacks total unemployment on a continuous basis. (A.B. 509,531; <a href="21.htm#2117">A-750-2117</a>)</li><br><br>
<li>Although  a claimant had a potentially functioning website and anticipated claiming  deductions for business expenses on her tax return, she was held to be totally  unemployed because she was performing no services, was not entertaining  customer inquiries through the website, and was not receiving new assignments.  (A.B. 547883;  <a href="21.htm#2137">A-750-2137</a>)</li><br><br>

<li>When a business entity is no longer viable having given up the business premises, having liquidated the inventory, and having no accounts receivable, claimant's limited and sporadic activities to pay the accounts payable do not render the claimant ineligible due to lack of total unemployment.

<li>When an employer's regulations or by-laws contain a formula for denoting the period to which accumulated vacation time is to be allocated, such period constitutes a designated vacation period.

<li>A provision in an employer's manual providing for the lump sum payment of accrued vacation upon an employee's termination and the allocation of the payment to the period following the last day of employment is not a designation of a paid vacation period within the meaning of Section 591.3 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. (A.B. 352,269A; <a href="19.htm#1951">A-750-1951)</a> </li><br><br>
<li>Where a collective bargaining agreement provides that each employee may elect, as a vacation period either the annual plant shutdown or another period of the individual's own choosing, and a claimant on layoff status is not offered the opportunity to make such choice, the claimant's receipt of vacation pay for the period of the plant shutdown is not a designation of paid vacation period within the meaning of Section 591.3 of the Unemployment Insurance Law.

<li>When an agreement negotiated between the employer and the claimant's union assigns the payment of vacation pay to a specific period following the last day of work, that time is a designated vacation period within the meaning of Section 591.3(b) of the Labor Law. It is not significant that the agreement was made in settlement of disciplinary proceedings seeking claimant's discharge. This is distinguished from situations where the employer <U>unilaterally </U>seeks to allocate the accrued vacation credits to the period following the claimant's last day of work.

<li>The fact that the claimant signed a separation agreement purporting to waive any claims against the employer that can be waive, does not preclude a finding that the payment upon separation constitutes dismissal pay, provided that there is no evidence of any existing lawsuit or potential lawsuit that the claimant agreed not to pursue under the terms of the agreement and in exchange for the severance amount paid to him or her.
