the Board refused to follow the commissioner’s argument that vacation pay
exceeding $50 rendered a worker ineligible. The Board said, &quot;Accordingly
we conclude that since claimant was unemployed on four days in the week ending
July 22 for which days he received no vacation allowance she is entitled to be
credited with one effective day despite the receipt by her of a payment in
excess of $50 which payment was made on the basis of an accrued contractual
right rather than as compensation for days of employment in that week.&quot;
While the provisions governing eligibility during paid vacations have been
amended, I find nothing in the new provisions which would lead to a contrary
conclusion. I, therefore, follow the decision of the Board as cited above. The

the purpose of those state agencies whose laws permit employer designation of

in item 3b on Form ES-931, and not to be a period subsequent to the date of
separation from employment (unless failure of the employer to allocate will
result in allocation to a period prior to the employee’s separation from his

herein has not been allocated to a period subsequent to the date of separation
from employment and since therefore, there is necessarily absent a designation
by the employer of a vacation period as required by Section 591.3 of the Law,
claimant was not on a paid vacation period during the period under review and

present important principles and supersede any prior conflicting instructions.
A claimant is not rendered ineligible for benefits by receipt of vacation pay
upon layoff when the employer, unilaterally, allocates the vacation pay to the period
following separation (or any other period) by payroll entries, reports to the
local office, or in some other manner, without advance communication thereof to
the claimant.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Similarly, ineligibility
will not result when the only notice to the employee of a vacation designation
is an&nbsp;<u>oral</u>&nbsp;statement by the employer on the&nbsp;<u>last day</u>&nbsp;of

decision implies that ineligibility will result when there is an expressed
agreement between the employer and the employee regarding the time for
vacation. Such agreement can, of course, be oral and need not predate the last
day of work. The Appeal Board also adheres to its former decision (A-750-1596;
A.B. 100,658) holding that the statutory requirement is satisfied when in
advance of the last day of work there is an oral designation to which the
employees acquiesced, that is to say, against which no protest was made.</span><span

fleet workers by the United States Department of Agriculture at a

active duty with the Federal agency was June 28, 1963. Thereafter, they went on
terminal leave status until August 30, 1963, at which time they were formally
separated from government service because of a reduction in force as reported
by the Federal agency. While on terminal leave, each claimant continued to
receive his salary every two weeks until the leave which each had accrued was
exhausted. The last day for which claimant J.N. received pay was August 21,
1963 and in the case of claimant W.T.L., August 12, 1963.</span><span

provides that a claimant has good cause to refuse employment if it is at an
unreasonable distance from his residence. The evidence herein establishes that
these mentioned statutory conditions have been met. Claimant did not continue
working under the changed conditions for a substantial period of time so as to
be deemed to have accepted permanently the change in her working conditions and

the continued unemployment after each local settlement date until actual recall

facts in the instant case are unprecedented. General Motors is a far flung
organization with 124 plants, widely separated geographically throughout the
United States, interdependent one upon the other, and each producing something
essential to a final finished product. When some of the plants are idle, others
must of necessity be idle. Claimants must have been fully aware of this when they
personally left their employment and initially participated in the strike.
Their unemployment during the period for which they have granted benefits was
the direct and inevitable consequence of the strike in which they joined. They
are not innocent victims of a situation wholly beyond their control, and their
unemployment may not be said to be involuntary (<u>Matter of Machcinski [Corsi]</u>&nbsp;277
App. Div. 634).&quot; (2084-5)</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The Appellate Division
was correct insofar as it stated that the other issue is &quot;the very narrow
question of when the strike or industrial controversy terminated within the
meaning of Section 592(1)&quot;, but erred, in our view, when it attributed a
vicarious voluntariness to the post-settlement unemployment on the ground that
the claimants ought to have foreseen the consequences of idleness in some
plants of an integrated industrial enterprise when they commenced the strike.
The statute in question expressly limits such considerations to single
&quot;establishments.&quot; There can be little doubt that, under our cases,
delays caused by lack of parts and supplies from other idle plants is not part
of the termination of an industrial controversy in an establishment that has
settled its own controversy.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The denial of benefits
where unemployment results from a dispute &quot;in the establishment in which
[the claimant] was employed&quot; is strictly limited by&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Ferrara</u>, 10 N.Y. 2d 1, to the geographic location of the employment
regardless of what the Appellate Division correctly recognized here as a highly
integrated nationwide industry (see also&nbsp;<u>Matter of Machcinski</u>, 277
App. Div. 634). In the face of the&nbsp;<u>Ferrara</u>&nbsp;case it cannot be
said that the several plants involved in this case constitute a single
establishment. The Appellate Division avoided the establishment concept and
simply regarded participation in the nationwide strike to be an adequate
predicate for a holding of voluntary unemployment until all plants were again
in operation. While statutes in other states may be framed differently (<u>United
Steel Workers</u>&nbsp;v.&nbsp;<u>Board of Review</u>, 12 Utah 2d 136, 363 P 2d
1116), in this State participation in a multi-establishment strike is not the
criterion of an individual’s right to unemployment benefits. As the&nbsp;<u>Ferrara</u>&nbsp;case
shows, non-participants within the same establishment are subject to the same
suspension of benefits as those who are engaged in the industrial controversy.
So, conversely, employees in an establishment in which no dispute exists, even
though they were participants in the initial multi-plant controversy, are not
denied benefits where their unemployment is traceable solely to a controversy
in another establishment. We hold that unemployment in one establishment that
is due to lack of essential supplies or parts from some other establishment
idle because of an industrial controversy qualifies for benefits under section
592, subdivision 1, if the controversy in the former is terminated.</span><span

this appeal questions the Appellate Division’s affirmance of the Unemployment
Insurance Appeal Board’s determination that the motor plant, forge and foundry
at Tonawanda was one establishment. The controlling decision is&nbsp;<u>Matter
of Ferrara</u>, 10 N.Y. 2d 1, which held that geographic unity is the primary
and ordinarily decisive factor in determining the existence of an establishment
under section 592, subdivision 1. It is simply a question of applying the
standard to the physical plant at Tonawanda. This seems to us to be the sort of
question as to which the administrator's choice should be given great weight.
Although the three divisions are represented by different local unions of the
United Automobile Workers, with different collective bargaining agreements, the
facilities occupy a single tract of about 150 acres and are surrounded by a
single 6 foot steel fence. Each has separate personnel records and each has a
separate cafeteria.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

are served by a single power house, water pumping station, sewage disposal,

matter of law – and there would be great difficulty in generalizing further
refinements – we must leave the Appeal Board’s determination undisturbed.</span><span

so long as the interruption in the flow of essential parts held up actual
operation. Cases such as&nbsp;<u>Ford Motor Co</u>. v.&nbsp;<u>Huffman</u>, 345
U.S. 330, and&nbsp;<u>Allis</u>-<u>Chalmers Mfg. Co</u>. v.&nbsp;<u>N.L.R.B.</u>,
213 F 2d 374, are cited to show how the provisions of a collective bargaining
agreement may override inconsistent mandates of law. For instance, in&nbsp;<u>Huffman</u>,
an agreement dealing with veterans’ seniority rights was held binding even
though it derogated from the statutory rights of returning veterans as set
forth in Federal law.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Assuming&nbsp;<u>arguendo</u>&nbsp;that
the provision was intended to have the effect now argued by respondent, it
cannot do so under our law. Cases dealing with a conflict between a contract
and a statute covering conditions of employment are not controlling. The
statute may there be rightly regarded as controlling only in the absence of a
contrary agreement. Here, however, conditions of employment are not involved.
We are asked to hold that the benefits otherwise due the unemployed were
bargained away. In respect of social legislation designed to benefit those whom
the Legislature deems in need of assistance it is asking a great deal to have
us displace the legislative determination of the needy class to conform to a
prior private agreement – even though voluntarily entered into by those now in
need of help. Our law, defining the class entitled to benefits and the
conditions under which they are due, expressly recites that benefits shall be
accumulated before the expiration of seven weeks &quot;beginning with the day
after such strike, lockout or other industrial controversy was
terminated&quot;; and &quot;terminated,&quot; under our statute, means a
ratified settlement within a given establishment, regardless of what the
national collective bargaining agreement considers to be an &quot;authorized
strike&quot; in such &quot;affected bargaining unit.&quot; The sustenance due
the unemployed is not a fit subject of private waiver, whether through

is in fact due to disputed at other establishments, and labels notwithstanding,

#107,841, we dealt with a similar situation involving the effect of the posting
of a notice during the time when employees were away from the plant because of
a layoff. We there pointed out that Section 591 of the Law requires as a
condition precedent to the ineligibility of the claimant, that the employer not
only designate the vacation period but additionally announce the fact of such
designation to the employees. Consequently, we held that no announcement of the
designation had been made to employees who were in layoff status and who were
not otherwise notified by the employer that it had made such designation. In
the instant case, however, the employer had announced to the claimant in
advance of the designated vacation period, that it had so designated the
period, which is here in issue. The written statement, which accompanied the
vacation payment which claimant received on or about July 1, 1963, constituted
a sufficient announcement to the claimant of the fact of such designation.</span><span

period and that such layoff continued until a date subsequent to the close of
the vacation period does not alter the fact that he was ineligible for benefits
for the period for which he received a vacation payment so long as the employer
designated the vacation period in writing and duly announced same. The statute
as amended by L 1963, C 794, specifically provides for a period of
ineligibility in the cases there provided for notwithstanding that the
employment may have been previously terminated. Accordingly, we conclude that
the claimant was ineligible to receive benefits for the period for which he was
paid since such period was a vacation period as contemplated by the provisions

about 35 years. He was compelled to abandon work in that occupation in about
September 1961 because he suffered a broken back and leg injuries. After he
made some recovery from the injuries he suffered, he worked intermittently as a
taxi driver between February 1962 and March 1963. On or about March 15, 1963,
claimant again became disabled due to a coronary occlusion which he suffered.
He recovered from his disability sufficiently to enable him to engage in
sedentary or clerical work on and after October 12, 1963. He actually worked as
a telephone solicitor for one day but abandoned that work because excessive
travel time and considerable walking was involved to travel to that place of
employment. Since April 13, 1964, claimant has worked on a full-time basis as
an assistant manager of a restaurant.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

of his physician that it would be advisable for him to reside in a warmer
climate, claimant went to Puerto Rico on December 22, 1963. His wife remained
in New York City and claimant continued to maintain his apartment there. Although
he made no inquiry in advance with respect to opportunities for work in Puerto
Rico, he maintained that he went to that area for the purpose of becoming
employed there. He established his resident in Puerto Rico at a point which
would have required travel for at least an hour to reach any possible labor
market. Moreover, opportunities for the procurement of work by claimant in
Puerto Rico were virtually non-existent because of claimant’s inability to
speak Spanish fluently. He submitted statements at the Puerto Rico local office
purporting to indicate a search for work by having allegedly visited one
establishment on each day. He indicated that he followed that pattern of
seeking work because he was advised that in Puerto Rico an applicant for
benefits was required to establish contact with one prospective employer a day.
Claimant was unable to qualify for a taxi driver’s license in Puerto Rico.
Admittedly, claimant was ill with a virus infection on January 3, and from
March 10 to March 21, 1964, and he was unable to work on those days.</span><span

from two local unions. He was paid unemployment insurance benefits aggregating

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is contended on behalf of the Industrial
Commissioner that since claimant received an accepted disability benefits under
the Federal social security program on the basis of his certification that he
was unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment, he is necessarily
ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits, on the ground that he is
incapable of employment within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance
Law. The theory so advanced is without validity. (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Roehsler</u>, 19 App. Div. 2d, 927, reversing Appeal Board, 98,779). The
application for disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act and
the receipt of benefits thereunder are evidentiary matters, but do not
constitute conclusive proof of incapability under the provisions of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. This is especially true, since the Social Security
Act encourages the resumption of work by recipients of disability benefits, in
that the Act specifically requires a recipient for such benefits to submit to
vocational rehabilitation. Moreover, the Act provides for the continuance in
the payment of disability benefits notwithstanding that the recipient thereof
engages in employment for a period of time while receiving such benefits
(Section 222 of the Federal Social Security Act, as amended).</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the instant case, the
proof adduced establishes that claimant was not totally prevented, by reason of
his disability, from engaging in some employment. On the contrary, it has been
established that claimant is physically capable of engaging in various types of
sedentary work. The procurement of work by claimant confirms that fact.
Accordingly, we conclude that except for January 3, and from March 10 through
March21, 1964, when the specific illness for which claimant suffered prevented
him from working, he was capable of employment.</span><span style='font-size:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Until claimant left New
York City to go to Puerto Rico, he established his availability for work by
presenting himself for employment wherever he believed work, which he could
perform, was available. Similarly, after claimant returned to New York City from
Puerto Rico, he again established his availability for work. However, while
claimant was in Puerto Rico, he effectively withdrew from the labor market.
While claimant may have acted in the interest of his health in temporarily
moving to Puerto Rico, his failure to make advance inquiries with respect to
opportunities for work in that area indicate the lack of a real desire to
become there employed. This is especially true in view of claimant’s inability
to speak fluently the language of the Island. Claimant’s alleged search for
work while in Puerto Rico fails to demonstrate the exercise of real diligence.
It appears that he attempted to make a formal compliance with what he believed
was required of an applicant for benefits in Puerto Rico rather than to actually
procure work. If, in truth, claimant was desirous of becoming employed, he
would not have remained in Puerto Rico for almost four months after having
learned soon after his arrival in that area that there were virtually no
opportunities for his employment.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

that employees who worked full-time were entitled to a day’s pay for each of

herein were employed as regular part-time workers. Under the provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement claimants were not entitled to receive any
holiday pay as such. Instead they were paid 40 cents in addition to their
regular hourly rate for each hour they actually worked during a week in which a
holiday occurred. Unlike the full-time employees who received a full days pay
for holidays in addition to their regular week’s pay, the claimants herein
received no pay for the holidays, but only a higher hourly rate of pay for the
time they actually worked. Under such circumstances it cannot be said that the
additional 40 cents per hour for time actually worked have any relationship to
holiday pay. Therefore, we conclude that the claimants were not paid for the
holidays and were totally unemployed on the holidays in issue, within the
meaning of Section 591.3 of the Law and were not overpaid in benefits.</span><span

purpose of the D.J. Profit Sharing Retirement Plan is twofold. It is intended
through the deposit of money in the Fund in every year in which the Company
earns a net profit to provide a retirement benefit for those of its regular
employees who qualify under the plan by reason of length of service with the
Company and thus to assure them of income in the years after they have ceased

contribute to the efficient operation of the Company.&quot;</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Under these terms of the
trust agreement the employer obligated itself to pay periodically to the
trustees a portion of its profits to be deposited in the fund established for
the benefit of employees entitled to participate in the plan. The trustees are
required to establish a separate account for each eligible employee and to
credit each of such accounts with the share of the profits specified in the
trust agreement. Every employee, except certain employees not here material,
who shall have been continually employed by the employer for at least five
years is entitled to participate in the plan. No contributions to the plan are
made by any employees, but it is funded entirely by the moneys paid to the
trustees by the employer out of the latter’s profits. The employees who thus
became members of the plan acquired a vested interest in the moneys credited to
their accounts by the trustees, but under no circumstances may any employee
while he remains in the employ of the Company, withdraw any part of such moneys
or assign or transfer his right to receive such moneys, nor is the employees’
interest therein subject to any attachment, execution, garnishment, trustee
process or any other legal or equitable process or bankruptcy proceedings.
However, upon the termination of employment of an eligible employee, the total
of moneys credited to his account by the trustees under the plan becomes
available for his benefit or to his beneficiary in the event of his death, and
such entitlement does not become forfeited irrespective of the time when the
termination of employment occurs, nor on account of the cause for such
termination. When the eligible member’s employment terminates, the method of

that the plan promulgated by the employer does not qualify as a retirement plan

statute a qualified retirement plan must be funded by contributions regularly
made without regard to whether the employer had earned a profit and based upon
certain actuarial tables (section 401, Internal Revenue Code; C.C.H. Pension
Plan Guide, Paragraph 10,054). However, the Legislature of this state in
enacting Section 600 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, did not require that in
order to provide a basis for reducing a claimant’s benefit rate, the plan under
which payments are made must qualify as a retirement plan under the Internal
Revenue Code. On the contrary, the statute in general language requires a
benefit rate reduction in every instance in which a pension or retirement
payment is made under a plan financed in whole or in part by an employer. It is
clear from the specific language of the trust agreement, which created the plan
in issue that the primary purpose thereof was to provide retirement payments to
employees who qualify as beneficiaries. Obviously, therefore, the payments to
which an employee becomes entitled when he is retired from an employer’s employ
is a pension or retirement payment. It is to be presumed that when the statute
was enacted, the Legislature recognized the distinction between plans which
qualify as profit sharing plans under the Internal Revenue Code and those which
qualify as retirement plans under that code. If the Legislature had intended to
except from the effect of Section 600 payments made in pursuance of profit
sharing plans, they would have stated so specifically.</span><span

contributions made by the employer, does not alter this conclusion. These
moneys were in no sense funds of the employees, notwithstanding that they
acquired the vested right to the receipt of such moneys upon termination of

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The posting of
available work by a representative of the union upon the request of an employer
constitutes and is, in effect, a constructive referral to employment since all
seamen who have registered for employment are invited to apply for the
available position. This is the only mode of referral to employment in
connection with the hiring of seamen through the union hiring hall. A seaman is
aware that he is required to shape daily in order to be considered for employment
in connection with this process of referral. With reference to selection for
other types of employment, in the ordinary case the workers who are referred to
a prospective employer are interviewed and one applicant is selected by the
employer for the available position. In connection with seamen, it has been
agreed that selection for the position among the seamen who have been referred
(the process of referral is made up of posting of the jobs in the union hiring
hall for bids by any seaman possessing an employment registration card) will be
based upon the seniority of the seamen who have registered for employment and
have accepted the referral by bidding for the position. Accordingly, where a
seaman has reasonable prospects of employment because of employment
registration seniority, and he fails to bid for a position, such failure to bid
for the work which the seaman has reasonable prospects of obtaining,
constitutes a constructive refusal of referral within the meaning of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. To hold otherwise would mean that a seaman who
obtained employment through a union hiring hall could never be disqualified for
refusing employment by simply failing to bid for available work. No such result
was intended by the Law.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

the telephone company, last worked for the employer on July 2, 1964. She
commenced this employment which was a temporary tenure on September 17, 1963,
and worked three days a week, seven hours a day. The employer’s rules provide
that temporary employees could only work for a period of 11 consecutive months
and then would be terminated by the employer. The termination is a lay-off and
is characterized by the employer as &quot;work completed.&quot; Temporary
employees are not eligible for rehire until the expiration of three months from
the last day of work and are only permitted to resign if there is no work for
them in which event the employee can be reinstated after a one week period.
There was work for claimant through August 17, 1964. However, on July 2, 1964,
claimant notified the employer that she wished to resign in order to be with
her children during the summertime. She had hired her cousin to care for her
children. Claimant’s presence therefore was not a compelling necessity in order
to care for her children. Although there was work for claimant on July 2, 1964,
her resignation was characterized by the employer as &quot;work

claimant primarily was motivated to resign by the fact that in any event the
employer was going to terminate claimant mandatorily on August 17 and she would
have to wait three months for rehire and therefore claimant chose to have the
three months’ suspension period commence with July 2 rather than August 17,
1964. We hold that the actual date of claimant’s filing for benefits does not
affect our conclusion that claimant’s voluntarily leaving of employment was

were affiliated, negotiated with the employers for a renewal contract. It
agreed with the employers to indefinitely extend the period of the expired

members would continue in employment in the New York City establishments.
However, Local 617, the local which covered the New Jersey employees, declared
a strike against the employers on June 1, 1964, and during the pendency of such
strike, that local caused picketing at the New York City establishments of the
employers, specifically at the premises where each of the claimants herein was
employed. Claimants, together with other persons employed in the New York City
establishment, refused to cross the picket lines which had been placed by the
New Jersey local at the New York City establishment and therefore they ceased
working. They returned to work immediately after the pickets were removed.
Prior to the time when the pickets were completely removed from the New York
premises, the employers commenced a proceeding in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York charging the New Jersey union local
with illegal picketing and by consent of the parties a restraining order was
issued by the Court limiting the number of pickets which could be maintained at

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee concluded
that claimants herein had not lost their employment due to the existence of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed, but
nevertheless concluded that claimants were subjected to disqualification on the
theory that by terminating their employment on account of their unwillingness
to cross a picket line, they voluntarily left their employment without good
cause within the purview of the Unemployment Insurance Law. There is ample
authority in support of the referee's conclusion that claimants did not lose
their employment as the result of an industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed. It has been held repeatedly that the
suspension of benefits provided for in Section 592 of the Law applies only in
instances where the loss of employment results form an industrial
controversy&nbsp;<u>in the</u>&nbsp;<u>establishment</u>&nbsp;in which the
claimants were employed. &quot;Establishment&quot; has been defined as the
geographical location of the place of employment (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of</u>&nbsp;<u>George</u>,
14 N.Y. 2d 234 affirming Appeal Board 68,848 et seq'&nbsp;<u>Matter of Ferrara</u>,
10 N.Y. 2d modifying Appeal Board 63,261 thru 63,308-58 et al.). In the instant
case it is undisputed that there was no controversy between the employer and
claimants or their co-workers at the New York establishment or the union which
represented them. The employer was involved in an industrial controversy with
the union with which it contracted with respect to employees located at an
entirely different establishment in another state. The existence of that
industrial controversy in New Jersey cannot be deemed to have existed in the
establishment in which claimants herein were employed. Nor does the fact that
the New Jersey local picketed the New York City establishment (See&nbsp;<u>Matter
of</u>&nbsp;<u>Ferrara,</u>&nbsp;supra; also Appeal Board 69,148; 70,856).
Accordingly, we concur in the conclusion reached by the referee that the
claimants herein did not lose their employment as a result of an industrial
controversy in the establishment at which they were employed and hence they are
not subject to a suspension of benefits under the provisions of Section 592 of
the Law.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

consideration the question with regard to whether claimants' refusal to cross

fear of personal violence, a worker is provided with good cause to refuse to
cross a picket line if his personal scruples so dictate (<u>Matter of

benefit payments for the period from July 6 to August 16, 1964. Claimant did
not realize that he was not entitled to benefits for that period because of the

penalty, or the fact that he was required to sign for six checks that he would
not receive because of such penalty. Accordingly, this overpayment is not
recoverable.&nbsp;<u>However, the forfeiture penalty remains in effect and in
the event the claimant becomes entitled to receive benefits, such penalty may
be imposed.</u>&nbsp;On the issue of availability claimant has shown no
attachment to the labor market. His acceptance of the retirement annuity
prevents him from working for his prior employers and it appears that he is not

the Canal Division of the State Department of Public Works, as a ship's cook,
at an annual salary of $4124. He worked a five-day, 40-hour week and was paid
gross wages of $163.16 bi-weekly. Claimant commenced his employment on April
13, 1964. The job was a seasonal one and was scheduled to terminate in
December. During the course of his employment, claimant accumulated vacation
time and personal leave time. In addition, he worked overtime for which he was
to receive compensatory time off. The employing agency calculated that if
claimant's last day of work were November 16, he would be able to liquidate 172
hours of accumulated annual leave, 14 hours of personal leave and 47.30 hours
of overtime by the end of the year. Accordingly, claimant last worked on November
16, but was carried on the employer's payroll until his accumulated time was
liquidated. He received his regular bi-weekly pay check with the usual tax
deductions until he was removed from the payroll and officially terminated.</span><span

finding that he was not totally unemployed is unwarranted. Of course, this
determination is factual and must be sustained if supported by substantial
evidence. Here there is evidence that claimant was, at the time he claims to
have been totally unemployed, engaged in free-lance work as a business
consultant. He maintained an office and storage space, had a telephone
answering service and a listing in the telephone directory, and advertised in a
trade publication. The fact that this was merely a sideline while he was regularly
employed or that it was sporadic and involved only a limited investment is not
controlling. Nor is the fact that the endeavor was non-remunerative during the
period for which benefits are claimed (<u>Matter of Bailey</u>&nbsp;[<u>Catherwood</u>],
18 AD 2d 727) or that claimant did not realize that his activities constituted

were Saturday and Sunday, days on which the local office was closed. The Board

difference in this case from the factual situation in Appeal Board 55,352.
Claimant herein admittedly failed to report to the local office on April 14,
1965 through his own neglect. Since he is chargeable with a failure to report
on April 14, 1965, he is likewise to be charged with the consequences which
flow from his failure to report on that date, whether or not the local office
was open during the intervening days before he finally reported on April 19.
Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the quoted paragraph of
Regulation 41, claimant may not receive credit for April 15 through April 18,
1965. Since claimant could not accrue any effective days during the statutory
week ending April 18, 1965, it is not necessary to decide claimant's
availability for employment effective April 13, 1965, only, as that question is

to the payment of benefits to claimant for the statutory week in issue, on the
ground that claimant's cash wages of $48 and the vacation pay stamps of $2.90

laid off from her last job on December 11, 1964. During the course of her claim
for benefits filed effective December 14, 1964, initial determinations were
issued by the local office holding claimant ineligible to receive benefits (1)
for an indefinite period effective December 14, 1964 because she was not
available for employment and (2) effective December 21 through December 27,
1964 because she failed to comply with reporting requirements. Claimant duly
requested a hearing thereon which was held on January 22, 1965. During the
course of said hearing, claimant testified in connection with the issue of her
search for work, that she had placed a &quot;situations wanted&quot;
advertisement in one of the leading metropolitan newspapers on four successive
Sundays. She submitted to the referee a receipt purporting to have been issued
by an advertising agency which Claimant had used for the placement of the
advertisement. Claimant offered such testimony for the deliberate purpose of
convincing the referee that she was available for work and that she was making
diligent efforts to seek work. The referee adjourned the hearing in order to
allow the Industrial Commissioner to confirm the receipt as well as various job
efforts which claimant alleged she had made. Thereafter and on February 3,
1965, the local office issued the initial determination charging claimant with
having wilfully made false statements to obtain benefits and imposing the
penalty herein reducing claimant's future benefit rights by 20 effective days
because claimant &quot;. ..produced a fake receipt for an ad placed with the
N.Y. Times through an agency at the hearing which was held on 1/22/65.&quot;</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is abundantly and
unmistakably clear that claimant was attempting to obtain benefits under the
Unemployment Insurance Law when she deliberately and wilfully made a false
statement when she testified that she had demonstrated her availability by
causing an advertisement to be placed in the newspapers and that she had a
receipt from an advertising agency attesting to that fact. Claimant admittedly
knew that the statement was false and that she had made it with the calculated
intent that it be relied upon so that she would obtain benefits. The
circumstance that claimant made the wilful misrepresentation in the course of
her testimony before the referee at the hearing on the merits of her claim for
unemployment insurance benefits cannot alter the conclusion that the statutory
penalty provided for in Section 594 of the Law must be imposed. That section
makes no distinction as to the manner or the place where wilful
misrepresentations are made and provides only that a penalty be imposed upon a
claimant who has wilfully made a false statement or representation to obtain
any benefit under the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law.</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We are not in accord
with the referee's conclusion that Section 594 is inapplicable for the reason
that the section is found in Title 7 of the Law, (dealing with benefits and
claims) and therefore does not encompass proceedings set forth in Title 8 of
the Law. Section 594 specifically provides that it relates to wilful
misrepresentations made to &quot;obtain any benefit under the provisions of
this&nbsp;<u>article</u>&quot; (underscoring supplied). Titles 7 and 8 are
parts of the same Article of the Labor Law, namely Article 18, which is the
Unemployment Insurance Law (Section 500). Consequently, when a claimant, in
furtherance of his claim for benefits under Title 7 of the Law, avails himself
of the right to protest an initial determination, the proceedings which ensue,
including the hearing which is held in pursuance of the provisions of Title 8
of the Law, are part and parcel of the proceedings by which claimant is
attempting to obtain a benefit under the provisions of Article 18 of the Labor
Law. Hence, as in the instant case, when the claimant wilfully and deliberately
testifies falsely and attempts to bolster such false testimony by producing
manufactured, spurious documentary evidence for the specific purpose of
inducing the hearing officer to overrule the initial determination of
ineligibility in reliance thereon, the conclusion is compelled that such
claimant has wilfully made a false statement to obtain a benefit under the
provisions of Article 18 of the Labor Law, as contemplated by Section 594
thereof.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

conclusion, we do not subscribe to the contention advanced on behalf of the
Industrial Commissioner to the effect that Section 594 was adopted by the
Legislature with the &quot;express intent&quot; of providing &quot;a useful
means or method of deterring the commission of perjury at Appeal Board or
Referee hearings&quot; or that such section was adopted &quot;in order to
provide a means of administrative control of referee and Appeal Board
hearings.&quot; Suffice it to say, that it has been conclusively established in
the instant case that this claimant deliberately and wilfully made false
statements and representations by affirmatively producing a document which she
knew to be spurious.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

necessarily follows that the penalty provided for in Section 594 of the Law is
applicable. We recognize that interested parties may exaggerate and that
testimony may be colored by the desire to present the issues in the light most
favorable to the affiant. In such instances, the issue will be disposed of on
the basis of the hearing officer's evaluation of the credibility of proof, and

Commissioner is not precluded from issuing the initial determination here under
review by reason of the fact that claimant's actions complained of may
constitute a basis for criminal prosecution. Significantly Section 630, contained
in Title 9 of the Law, dealing with penalties and misdemeanors, specifically
provides that the penalties and misdemeanors therein defined &quot;are in
addition to those otherwise prescribed in this entire article.&quot;
Accordingly, we conclude that such false statement by claimant, under these
particular circumstances, constitutes a wilful misrepresentation made to obtain
benefits and requires the imposition of the statutory penalty (Labor Law,
Section 594).</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The proponents of
polygraph testing advocate that the system is a scientific and reasonable
method in ascertaining whether or not the subject is, in fact, telling the
truth. Those who oppose such examinations insist that the polygraph tests are
not accurate and depend upon too many variable factors over which the person
administering the test has no control or which the subject to be examined has
no control. Notwithstanding, it is universally recognized that a polygraph test
is not infallible because of the human variables involved and that the readings
and results of a polygraph test are not necessarily accurate. The physical
makeup of the subject examined results in this inaccuracy since it is common
knowledge that various individuals may do violence to the truth without any
appreciable increase in the pulse rate or the like and that although their
answers may be false, they are not so recorded on the polygraph. Conversely,
individuals who are timid, nervous and the like may give truthful answers and
the polygraph may record them as contrary. Consequently, I must conclude that
an agreement to submit to a polygraph test as a term and condition of
employment is unreasonable and that claimant's failure to submit, even though she
had previously agreed to do so, may not be the basis of her disqualification
for benefits.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>By requiring claimant to
submit to a polygraph test as the terms and conditions of her employment, the
employer is attempting to abridge claimant's constitutional rights against
self-incrimination. While it is true that an individual may waive his rights
under the State and Federal Constitution, I know of no case law or any statute,
either at the federal or state level, which requires claimant to waive her
rights in the future as in the instant case. Claimant's rights under the
Constitution are only waived when she actually submits to the examination or
answers questions concerning a subject matter which may tend to demonstrate
that claimant is not taking refuge in the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.
Further, the questions asked claimant by the employer not only concerned her
conduct but also the conduct of her co-employees. The latter does nothing more
than to foster co-employees to spy on one another, and is an attempt to have
co-employees act in the capacity of informer on behalf of the employer.</span><span

defects in polygraph testing, it is conceivable that an individual who has
never violated any employer's rules may fail to pass the test. Accordingly he
would be discharged and allegedly charged with an act of dishonesty which he
did not, in fact, commit. We must not permit the possibility of an individual's
reputation being irreparably harmed on an imperfect and unscientific method of
examination.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

representative who appeared and testified at the hearing stated in substance
that in the event an employee was examined and the polygraph test was not
favorable, that employee would not be discharged until and unless the employer
secured a confession from the employees. This fact opened another facet which
could conceivably lead to abuse and abridge an individual's rights. Assume, and
we are in no way implying that the employer does engage in the following
practices, that an unfavorable reading was received. It is conceivable that the
employer would subject the employee to an extensive, vigorous and rigorous
examination to the point where the individual may readily confess to any
conduct in order to forego any further interrogation. The employer's argument
carried to its logical conclusion, that is, an unfavorable reading will not
result in a loss of employment unless a confession is obtained, results in an
absurd conclusion. It is difficult to reconcile the employer's position that an
employee will not be discharged in the event of an unfavorable reading and
unless a confession is obtained, but, nevertheless, an employee will be
discharged for the failure to submit to a polygraph test. This rationale is
absurd. If the employee will not be discharged for an unfavorable result, why
should an employee be discharged for failing to submit to the polygraph test.</span><span

that very often a case will arise where an unemployed worker in his quest for

Oftentimes, unreasonable conditions are propounded and in this fashion accepted
by a needy worker who, upon realizing the unreasonableness of the conditions,
will, thereafter, refuse to adhere to them. In such situations and where we
find that such conditions were in fact unreasonable, we have consistently held
that a claimant for benefits was provided with good cause for leaving

unreasonable conditions in order to hold on to his job within the purview of

stockholders of the corporation, which commenced operations on October 1, 1962
in premises leased by claimant at a rental of $50 per month. From that time
until March 1965, when claimant permitted the corporation's license from the
Department of Health to expire, he performed managerial and other services in
connection with the business, such as the preparation, sale and delivery of
foodstuffs. Claimant considered the business a hobby because he devoted a few
evenings a week thereto and was simultaneously employed by another catering
firm on a full-time basis.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:

claimant filed an original claim for benefits effective September 3, 1962. He
thereafter filed additional claims for benefits, encompassing two successive
benefit years, and received benefits in the total amount of $1850 during these
years. On each of his reporting days from October 10, 1962 through September
16, 1964, claimant certified that he was totally unemployed and available for
employment; and did not disclose his status as an officer and principal
stockholder of the catering corporation nor his activity in connection
therewith. On and after September 11, 1963, claimant completed three
questionnaires specifically asking whether or not he was self-employed, or an
officer or stockholder of a corporation by which he had been employed or to
which he had rendered services in the preceding year and in each instance

elapsed since the first occasion on which claimant made the misrepresentation.
We conclude that such limitation should be computed from the last date on which
the offense was committed, even though it related to a single fact or status
and each occasion was merely a repetition of the same false statement. Claimant
on each of his reporting days up to September 16, 1964, kept alive the wilful
misrepresentation to obtain benefits by consistently repeating it. The period
for serving the forfeiture penalty did not expire, since it must be computed

of the employer's Buffalo, Tonawanda and Massena plants, went on strike on
September 11, 1961 in a dispute over both national and local issues.
Negotiations commenced forthwith and at the Buffalo plant a &quot;memorandum of
understanding&quot; was signed on September 16, this document concluding the
strike there, subject to ratification which was forthcoming. Operations were
started up at Buffalo on September 15, but it was not until September 26 that
work was fully resumed. At Tonawanda a memorandum of understanding was signed
on September 24, operations were started on that date, and were fully resumed on
September 28. At Massena the memorandum was signed on September 20, work was
started that day and was fully resumed by September 27. A national memorandum
of understanding was signed on September 20 and a full agreement was signed on
September 26 with ratification coming on October 2. The sole question presented
here is whether the claimants are barred by virtue of § 592 (1) of the Labor
Law from receiving unemployment benefits for the period between the signing of
their local memorandums and the resumption of full operations at their
respective plants. The employer urges initially that despite the earlier local
settlements and the fact that the plants actually resumed some operations, the
industrial controversy did not terminate until September 26 when the full
national agreement was signed and thus that no benefits could be accrued prior
to that date.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

the employment regardless of what the Appellate Division correctly recognized
here as a highly integrated nationwide industry. In the face of the&nbsp;<u>Ferrara</u>&nbsp;case
it cannot be said that the several plants involved in this case constitute a
single establishment. The Appellate Division avoided the establishment concept
and simply regarded participation in the nationwide strike to be an adequate
predicate for a holding of voluntary unemployment until all plants were again
in operation. While statutes in other States may be framed differently (<u>United
Steel Workers v. Board of Review</u>, 12 Utah 2d 136), in this State
participation in a multi-establishment strike is not the criterion of an
individual's right to unemployment benefits. As the&nbsp;<u>Ferrara</u>&nbsp;case
shows, non-participants within a struck establishment are subject to the same
suspension of benefits as those who are engaged in the industrial controversy.
So, conversely, employees in an establishment in which no dispute presently
exists, even though they were participants in the initial multi-plant
controversy, are not denied benefits where their unemployment is traceable
solely to a controversy in another establishment.&quot;</span><span

since the strike caused the shutdown and only a gradual resumption of
operations was possible thereafter, the claimants remained out of work
&quot;because of a strike&quot; which was not therefore &quot;terminated&quot;
until full operations resumed. While other jurisdictions have embraced this
position (<u>Leach v.</u>&nbsp;<u>Republic Steel Corp.,</u>&nbsp;176 Ohio St.
221, 199 NE 2d 3), we find no clear holding determinative of<i>&nbsp;</i>this
question in this State.&nbsp;<u>Matter of George (supra</u>); while it holds
that unemployment due to industrial controversy at another establishment does
not preclude benefits if the controversy at the employee's establishment is
settled, does not directly answer this question. Nor is the admittedly
analogous case of&nbsp;<u>Matter of Vingoe</u>&nbsp;[<u>Bethlehem</u>&nbsp;<u>Steel
Co</u>.] (285 App. Div. 160) a binding precedent in the instant case since
in&nbsp;<u>Vingoe</u>, unlike the present case, there was no termination of the
labor controversy. As this court noted in&nbsp;<u>Vingoe</u>, the Presidential
seizure, while averting an actual work stoppage, did not terminate the labor
controversy.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Faced then with a
question of relatively first impression in this State, we are constrained to
find that benefits were properly awarded. The labor controversy here invoked
was clearly terminated in the sense that the dispute between labor and
management had been settled, and, therefore, the legislative purpose in denying
financial assistance during the course of the controversy had been satisfied.
Thus even though the unemployment involved was obviously causally connected to
the labor controversy, we find no basis to hold that the labor controversy was
not terminated within the meaning of § 592(1). The lack of work occasioned by
the necessity for gradual resumption of production is merely an incident of the
particular industry which is outside the purview of the statute and over which
neither side has any control. We can find no compelling reason here &quot;in
attributing a vicarious voluntariness to the post-settlement unemployment&quot;
in view of the Court of Appeal's rejection of such a position in&nbsp;<u>Matter
of George&nbsp;</u>(<u>supra</u>, at 239).</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

determination he was disqualified for refusal of employment without good cause
effective August 16, 1965. Claimant contested such initial determination, but

decision, the Appeal Board issued its decision affirming the decision of the
referee sustaining the initial determination (Appeal Board, 127,805).</span><span

had violated provisions of the collective bargaining agreement by failing to
provide claimant with work and assigning such work to persons in other
occupational classifications. In pursuance of the provisions of the collective
bargaining agreement, the grievance proceeded to arbitration and on November
10, 1965 the grievance was sustained and an award was made holding that the
employer violated the seniority provisions of the contract by having persons in
other occupations perform work which should have been performed by claimant and
others, and directing the employer to reimburse claimant for time lost from April
21, 1965 to the date of the award, less any monies earned or benefits received.</span><span

not totally unemployed because, retroactively, he received compensation from
his employer, the legislature provided in Section 597 of the Law that the
Industrial Commissioner is authorized to review an initial determination within
six months from a retroactive payment of remuneration and that, notwithstanding
the good faith of the claimant, and the absence of any false statement or
representation or wilful concealment of pertinent facts, the overpayment thus
resulting is recoverable. It was in pursuance of such legislative mandate that
claimant was required to and did repay the sum of $314.50 theretofore paid to

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Notwithstanding the
settled Law to the effect that a claimant is not totally unemployed in a period
for which he receives back pay and that the monies so received by him
constitute wages and remuneration within the purview of the Unemployment
Insurance Law, it is here contended that Section 593.2 of the law precludes
claimant from receiving unemployment insurance benefits for the period of his
unemployment following the issuance of the award and for periods for which he
is not entitled to any back pay. Reliance is placed upon the language of
Section 593.2 which specifies that the disqualification therein provided for
shall remain in effect &quot;until he has subsequently worked in employment on
not less than 3 days in each of 4 weeks or earned remuneration of at least
$200.&quot; To credit such contention we would be required to conclude that the
back pay award which claimant received for the period beginning with August 16,
1965 did not constitute remuneration and that claimant was not in employment on
the days for which he was paid in pursuance of such award. The court precedents
above cited mandate a contrary conclusion. To paraphrase the language of Mr.
Justice Brewster in the&nbsp;<u>Skutnik</u>&nbsp;case,&nbsp;<u>supra,</u>&nbsp;-
claimant took the position that because the employer was guilty of unfair
practices, he was prevented from performing the duties of his employment, and
in prosecuting his complaint, he maintained that although he performed no
services he was entitled to his wages. The back pay award which claimant
received can only be held to have been compensation to him for the time during
which, but for the employer's wrongful actions, he would have been employed in
the usual sense of the word. The award of the back pay bespeaks his employment
during the period that he was thus held to have been prevented by the employer
from the actual performance of work. Therefore he did not suffer total
unemployment and, in essence, he continued to be employed from at least August
16 through November 10. Moreover, as was held in the&nbsp;<u>Tonra</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>McCoy</u>&nbsp;cases,
supra, the back pay award constituted remuneration. In view of the finding of
the arbitrator, it cannot be argued that such remuneration was other than
&quot;earned&quot; remuneration. Accordingly, we conclude that when claimant
refiled the claim in issue effective November 15, 1965, the conditions required
to terminate the disqualification previously imposed had been met and the
disqualification was no longer in effect.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, an electrician, 75 years of age,
filed a claim for benefits effective January 3, 1966, after he was compulsorily
retired by his last employer effective December 31, 1965. Claimant, upon his
retirement, became eligible to receive a pension of $73.31 monthly, under a
retirement plan promulgated by the employer and to which it contributed more
than 50 per cent but less than 100 per cent. Such payments were guaranteed to
claimant for the duration of his life or, at least ten years so that if he were
to die within ten years, the difference between the aggregate payments received
by him and that which would have been paid to him during a ten-year period
would become payable to his estate. Claimant had an option under the plan to
receive in a lump sum the present cash value of the pension. At the time of
claimant's retirement, the cash value of his pension was $8559.61. Claimant
preferred to receive a lump sum rather than monthly payments. However, he
desired to avoid the excessive tax liability which would result from a single
lump sum payment of upwards of $8,000, and, therefore, he agreed with the
employer to receive his pension in two payments; the first half to be paid in
January, 1966, and the final payment in January, 1967. With the addition of the
interest which would accrue on the second payment between January 1, 1966, and
the date when it would become payable in 1967, the total lump sum payment was
$8706.84, payable in two equal installments.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>We are not in accord
with the referee's conclusion. The basis for the interpretation placed upon the
statute by the Interpretation Section of the Field operations Bureau is not
readily apparent. While there may be some merit to the view that if a claimant
receives a single lump payment prior to the filing of his claim for benefits,
he is not receiving a pension&nbsp;<u>currently</u>&nbsp;while he is a claimant
for benefits. Nevertheless, such construction would have no application to the
facts herein because the first installment of the retirement payment was made
to the claimant after he had become an applicant for benefits and, hence, he
did&nbsp;<u>currently&nbsp;</u>receive a retirement payment. Accordingly, it is
unnecessary for us to decide the validity of such interpretation in other
instances of a single lump-sum payment. Suffice it to say, that under the facts
in the instant case, it is clear that claimant received and is entitled to
receive retirement payments of the nature described in Section 600 of the Law
and, therefore, a reduction of his benefit rate is required.</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Although some reduction
of claimant's benefit rate is mandated by the Law, we do not agree that the
rate should be reduced by $41 to $14 weekly. Apparently, the Commissioner's
representatives deducted from claimant's weekly benefit rate 1/52nd of 50 per
cent of $4353.42, the installment of the retirement payment which claimant
received in January, 1966. In our view, such computation is not authorized by
the statute. The payment of $4353.42 which claimant received in January, 1966,
was in no sense a retirement payment&nbsp;<u>for the year 1966.</u>&nbsp;Clearly,
that sum represented one-half of the cash value of a retirement payment of $13
monthly for the duration of claimant's life or, at least ten years.
Consequently, only 12 times $73.31 represents the portion of the payment which
can be allocated to 1966. Accordingly, in our judgment, $879.72 represents the
retirement payment which is allocable to 1966. On this basis, the approximate
prorated weekly amount of claimant's retirement payment is $17.08. Since
claimant's benefit rate must be reduced by one-half of that amount, it follows
that claimant's benefit rate should be reduced by $8 weekly, from $55 to $47
weekly, and we so hold.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

determination of the local office is modified to the extent that claimant's

rate by $8, and, as so modified, the initial determination is sustained. The

engaged in a study of the adequacy of retirement benefits payable under the
Civil Service Retirement Act. The study had not progressed to the point where
it was deemed advisable to enact permanent legislation in 1965, to correct the
situation which Congress deemed necessary in order to provide retirement
benefits commensurate with the increase in the cost-of-living price indices
and, therefore, during 1965, interim legislation was enacted which provided for
increases in the retirement allowances to those employees who elected to retire
no later than December 30, 1965. It was indicated in the reports of the
Congressional committees that it is anticipated that during 1966 the various
studies being made will have been completed and that Congress will then have
the benefit of the research and opinions of the President's Cabinet Committee
on Federal Staff Retirement Systems, concerning the full scope of Federal
retirement systems, thus enabling Congress to give consideration to permanent
changes in the law. However, the legislation enacted in 1965 provided that
those employees eligible for retirement who elected to retire subsequent to the
enactment of the law and no later than December 30, 1965, would receive an
increase in the retirement annuities to which such employees would ordinarily
be entitled by approximately 8.1 per cent. After the enactment of the
legislation, the United States Civil Service Commission, Bureau of Retirement
and Insurance, issued a release to all Federal employees advising them of the
enactment of the legislation and its effect and pointing out, among other
things, that if an employee who was eligible to retire on or before December
30, 1965, did not elect to voluntarily retire but continue in service
thereafter, he would receive an annuity substantially equal to that which he
would have received by retirement prior to December 30, 1965, if he remained in
service for a specific period of time thereafter, measured in length by the
number of years of service up to December 30, 1965. It was indicated in such
release that an employee with 25 years of service would receive an annuity
equal to the increase provided by the 1965 legislation if he continued in
employment for 23 additional months and received no salary increases in the
interim. The period of continuous service would be shortened to as few as eight
months if, in the interim, such person received high salary increases. A person
having more than 25 years of service as of December 30, 1965, but less than 30
years of service at that time, would have to remain in service for a maximum of

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: We have repeatedly
held that a worker who voluntarily retires from employment solely to avail
himself of the benefits of a retirement allowance or pension is subject to
disqualification from unemployment insurance benefits for having voluntarily
left his employment without good cause so long as he had no intention at the
time of his retirement of withdrawing from the labor market. We pointed out in
those cases that the reason which prompted the leaving of employment was purely
personal in nature and did not constitute good cause within the purview of the
Unemployment Insurance Law (Appeal Board, 123,725; 111,121). However, because
we recognize that it is sound social policy for superannuated workers to
withdraw from the labor market to enjoy the benefits of a retirement allowance
or pension to which they become entitled, a worker who leaves his employment to
permanently withdraw from the labor market in order to enjoy his retirement
allowance is provided with good cause to leave his employment (See Appeal
Board, 114,895; 112,384; 109,880). We have also held that in instances where a
worker would suffer a substantial financial loss or be required to forfeit
substantial benefits by failing to avail himself of the right of retirement at
a given time, his leaving of employment to avoid such detriment is with good
cause under the Law, notwithstanding that he has no intention of withdrawing
from the labor market (Appeal Board, 78,477).</span><span style='font-size:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>On the basis of the
principles enunciated in the cited cases, it follows that since claimant
intended to remain in the labor market following his retirement, his leaving of
employment was without good cause unless the evidence establishes that if he
had failed to exercise his option to retire, he would have suffered a financial
loss or would have forfeited substantial benefits. Viewing the evidence herein
in this light, we are compelled to conclude that claimant would not have
suffered any substantial loss or forfeiture if he failed to avail himself of
the right to retire effective December 30, 1965. Claimant had the right to
continue in employment for approximately four additional years. The reports of the
Congressional committees gave indication of the likelihood of the enactment of
permanent amendments to the Civil Service Retirement Act, which would provide
benefits to those who continued in service, at least equal to those provided
for employees who had elected to retire effective December 30, 1965. Moreover,
even if no action were taken by Congress subsequent to 1965, and during the
remainder of the time that claimant could have continued in the employ of the
Federal government, he would have had full opportunity to be placed in at least
the same status by completing no more than 28 additional months of service.</span><span

principles enunciated in the cited case, it is apparent that claimant had good
cause to leave his employment because he would have suffered a substantial
financial detriment if he had failed to avail himself of the right to
voluntarily retire effective December 30, 1965. It was mandatory that
claimant's employment would terminate within two months after the effective
date of his retirement. There was no reasonable likelihood that legislation
would be enacted prior to claimant's 7Oth birthday which would have resulted,
in providing him with a retirement allowance equal to that which was available
to him by his retirement on December 30, 1965. His age prevented him from
continuing in employment for the required number of months necessary to enable
him to recoup the reduction in his pension which would have come about by his
continuance in service after December 30, 1965. Accordingly, claimant left his
employment for compelling reasons and, therefore, his leaving must be held to
have been with good cause (See Appeal Board, 78,477).</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The nature of re-use
fees or residuals received by television or radio artists was considered by the
Appeal Board and by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third
Department, in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Price</u>, Appeal Board 56,753; 61,788.
(Latter decision affirmed 9 AD 2d 561.) In the cited case, the issue presented
as whether the claimant was entitled to be credited with a week of employment
in each week when the film was re-used by the employer for commercial purposes,
and for which the employer paid the artist the re-use fee. Originally, the
Board held that such week constituted a week of employment as defined by the
Unemployment Insurance Law, and that the claimant was entitled to be credited
therewith in establishing qualification for benefits (Appeal Board 56753-56).
However, upon reconsideration, the Board rescinded such decision and held that
the re-use of a film previously made did not entitle the claimant to credit of
a week of employment for the week in which such re-use was made (61788-57).
Such reconsidered decision of the Board was affirmed by the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court, Third Department in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Price</u>, supra.

construction placed by the Division of Employment on the decision of the Board,

procedure of the Division to accept from employers, contributions based on
re-use fees paid by them to the various artists, and to credit the artists with
the re-use fees in determining the benefit rate of those persons who became
claimants for benefits, allocating such re-use fees to the day or days on which
the films were actually made. This practice continued, at least until the
decision of the Board in the&nbsp;<u>Matter of Shopnick</u>&nbsp;Appeal Board
115,424 filed in the Department of Labor, November 6, 1964. In that case, there
was no issue with respect to the benefit rate of a claimant for benefits, but
the issue related solely to the liability of an employer for contributions
based on re-use fees which it had paid to a radio artist for the replay of a
record theretofore made. Neither the contracts which constitute part of the
record herein, nor other evidence of the nature submitted herein, were before
the Board in the&nbsp;<u>Shopnick</u>&nbsp;case. No claimant, or any
representative of the unions which have collective bargaining agreements with
the employers in this industry were parties to the&nbsp;<u>Shopnick</u>&nbsp;case.
In overruling the determination of the Industrial Commissioner, assessing
contributions based on re-use fees paid by that employer, we held that the
payments made for the re-use did not constitute remuneration as defined by the
Law.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

basis for establishing a benefit rate.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

is erroneous, and that in any event, it has no application to the facts in the

parties, re-use fees were specifically characterized as compensation for the

on behalf of the claimants, has merit. The evidence presented to the referee
and to the Board in the instant case, conclusively establishes that the parties
contemplated that the compensation or remuneration to be received by the
artists consisted of two separate and distinct parts: namely, that portion
which related to the actual appearance before the camera and that portion which
stemmed from the employers’ re-use of the film made as a result of such
appearance. In view of that fact, it appears that the re-use fees fall squarely
within the definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; as set forth in Section 517
of the Law, and therefore, must be considered in computing claimants’
&quot;average weekly wage&quot; as prescribed by Sections 518 and 590.2 of the

that re-use fees are taxable as compensation under the Federal Unemployment Tax
Act, and that the employers in any even, are liable for the payment of such
tax, even if we were to hold that such payments do not constitute remuneration
under the New York Unemployment Insurance Law. It is clear that the parties to
the employment contract contemplated that the re-use fees were to constitute
compensation for all purposes, and there appears to be no statutory prohibition
against giving effect to such intention of the parties. Accordingly, we
conclude that the re-use fees received by each of the claimants herein
constituted remuneration within the purview of the provisions of the Law, and
that each of the claimants is entitled to be credited with such re-use fees in
determining his average weekly wage, and in establishing his respective benefit
rate.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The proof here adduced
has established that the prospective employer involved in the job offer at
issue would not have provided claimant with any of the usual fringe benefits
provided by employers for similar work in the locality. Thus, claimant would
not have received, as a condition of the employment, premium free (to her)
hospital and medical insurance, the right to participate in a retirement plan,
the right to receive wage payments for legal holidays or the right to accrue
vacation credit. Since these various benefits are provided generally by
employers in the locality and employees therefore have acquired the right to
expect such benefits as an incident to their employment, it can hardly be said
that such benefits are merely a gratuity tendered by some employers. Rather,
such benefits have become vital and substantial conditions of employment and
the lack thereof constitutes a variance from the conditions of employment
prevailing for similar work in the locality. Therefore, we must evaluate those
benefits to determine whether the variance is substantial to the claimant. In
the light of the fact that the cash wage offered was no greater than the case
wage which prevails for similar work in the locality, we conclude that the
deprivation of the various fringe benefits results in a substantially less
favorable condition of employment. Obviously, if claimant were not paid for
legal holidays and if she were required to finance the cost of hospital and
medical insurance and of a retirement plan, she would be incurring substantial
expense not required of persons similarly employed who enjoy such protection
and benefits. Accordingly, we conclude that the conditions offered to claimant
were substantially less favorable to claimant than those prevailing for similar
work in the locality (see Appeal Board, 122,753).</span><span style='font-size:

referred to the former employer for whom she had worked as a sewing-machine
operator, to report on April 13. Claimant declined to report to that employer
because she feared that she would lose her new secretarial skills, and because
she had enrolled in the training course for the purpose of improving her
occupational sills and obtaining more steady employment. During the entire statutory
week ending April 24, claimant sought work diligently and had a number of
personal interviews with employers. She did not report to the insurance office

failing to report to her former employer and believed that it would be best for
her to continue to seek employment, rather than to visit the insurance office
to report. On April 22 the employment service referred claimant to a job with

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is ordinarily true
that a claimant for unemployment insurance benefits may not insist upon a job
which would make use of her best skills, or upon one which she prefers, rather
than another job for which she is reasonably fitted by training and experience.
Nevertheless, claimant’s contention is that to require her promptly to return to
work as a sewing-machine operator after the loss of her employment as a
secretary would be a waste of public funds. That contention has substantial
merit. The Federal Government provides substantial and intensive training under
the Manpower Development Training Act to improve the skills of those enrolled
in training courses. The provision for disqualification from benefits for
refusal of employment under Section 593, subdivision 2, of the Unemployment
Insurance Law, cannot be regarded in isolation. The Manpower Development and
Training Act and the New York Unemployment Insurance Law must be regarded in a
single context, as if they were an entity. It may very well be that if claimant
were unable to obtain work as a secretary after an extended period of unemployment,
she could reasonably be required to accept work in her former occupation. In
this instance, however, where she had been unemployed only a few days, to
disqualify her for refusing work as a sewing-machine operator would, in effect,
frustrate the entire purpose and intent of the Manpower Development and
Training Act. It is highly significant that claimant promptly obtained another
job as a stenographer as a consequence of action by the employment office.</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>This decision reflects
an exception to the general rule under which a refusal of employment because of
a desire for different employment is without good cause if the offered job is
in claimant’s usual occupation or is one for which he is fitted by training and
experience. (See&nbsp;<u>Matter of Delgado</u>; A-750-1015) It stands for the
new principle that special consideration should be given to skills acquired in
a government sponsored vocational training course, which is financed from
public funds. The reasons are well stated in the decision, and similar
considerations will apply to other training courses under governmental
auspices, comparable to MDTA training. Training under the new New York State
Manpower Training Act would be an illustration. Although in the instant case
the claimant had actually secured a previous job, and had already acquired same
work experience, in the new occupation, the same result should obtain if that
had not been the case.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

employer for about seven months until May 13, at a weekly wage of $110 per
week. She resides in West Seneca and worked in Hamburg. When claimant was
hired, no question arose with respect to her transportation to and from her
place of work. Until about January, claimant drove the family automobile.
However, in about early January, the use of the family automobile was no longer
available to her because her husband’s place of employment was transferred and
it was necessary for him to use the automobile. There are no public
transportation facilities between claimant’s home and her place of employment
with the result that when she advised the employer of her inability to travel
in the family car, the employer agreed to permit claimant to use a company car
temporarily until she could arrange for private transportation. Claimant had
made no arrangements for other transportation and after the claimant had used
the company vehicle for approximately three or four months, the employer
advised claimant in May that the use of that car would be withdrawn from
claimant and that it would be necessary for her to arrange for her own means of
transportation. Claimant had decided that she would not purchase another motor
vehicle and since without it there were no means of transportation available to
her, she resigned effective May 13, 1966.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

make certain that unemployment insurance contributions are paid. Section 631
which provides that the officers of a corporation are guilty of a misdemeanor,

there exists a wilful failure or refusal to pay contributions in this case, and
the record indicates that the failure to pay was not wilful. There is also no
provision in the Labor Law which imposes a personal liability upon the officers
of a corporation for the payment of contributions, unless it can be said that

Third Assistant Marine Engineer in the merchant service. He has been a members
of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association for more than 15 years. On July
25, 1963, while unemployed and an applicant for unemployment insurance
benefits, he was offered employment in his rating aboard a vessel of the Military
Sea Transport Service, a branch of the United States Navy. The wage offered for
such employment was $600 per month, which is the basic monetary payment for
claimant’s rating that is paid by all employers of such marine personnel.
Claimant refused the offer of employment aboard the government ship because of
the variances, which exist in other aspects between government employment and
private employment.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

paid and the fact that claimant’s duties aboard ship would be the same, regardless
of who was the employer, there are many differences which exist in the

employers: thus,</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

In private employment, claimant could retire at any age provided he had 20
years of service. He would not contribute anything to the cost of his pension,
which would amount to $300 per month. In addition, when he reached age 65,
based on such private employment, he could also receive Social Security
benefits of approximately $168 per month, thus making him the recipient of a
retirement income of approximately $468 per month, for which he would only have
contributed whatever was required by the Social Security Act for that portion
of such retirement income. In government employment, claimant could not retire
until he reached the age of 60 and he had to have at least 30 years of
government service. He would have to contribute at least 6½ percent of his pay
to assist in financing his government pension, which would amount to $342 per
month. He would be ineligible to receive Social Security benefits based on such
government employment. In order to receive Social Security, he would have to
have sufficient other&nbsp;<u>private</u>&nbsp;employment in order to qualify
thereunder.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

approximately $22 per month for the Health, Accident and Hospitalization policy

primarily with the fact that the duties of claimant aboard either a private
ship or a government ship would be precisely the same and his base pay for his
services would also be the same. We did not consider that the differences in
the fringe benefits available in the two employments were significantly
different so as to make government employment less favorable to claimant than
private employment. On the basis of the evidence now before the Board, we
conclude that such differences do exist between the two employments as to make
the government employment substantially less favorable to claimant than would
be private employment.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

Appeal Board, 63,045. We do not find that these cases are in point. They were
both concerned with the question of what is the prevailing wage and did not
consider the other conditions of the employment which section 593.2(d) of the Law,
require to be considered as factors in the question of whether a refusal of
employment shall be deemed to be with good cause or not. In the instant case,
the evidence establishes that there are such substantial differences present in
these other factors of the two employments as to have given claimant good cause
to refuse the offer of employment aboard the government ship, regardless of the

     principle. Decisions in the past were to the opposite effect. However, the
     application of this principle will be limited because fringe benefits for
     the majority of job offers will fall within generally prevailing
     conditions. As a rule, the issue will present itself only if the same

     differences within the various types. Each of the plans for pension,
     health services, and vacation entailed in private employment was markedly
     more favorable (including cost to employee, degree and duration of

     However, the overall cumulative effect of the fringe benefits must be
     evaluated in conjunction with other conditions in determining whether
     offered employment is substantially less favorable. Thus, if wages are
     offered which are above those which prevail, this may be a compensating
     factor so that the offered conditions in their entirety are not &quot;less
     favorable&quot; in the last analysis. Also, if the content of some of the
     fringe benefits is markedly superior to the &quot;prevailing&quot;
     content, this may overcome the absence of or inferiority in some other

years by a publisher of a New York City newspaper. He is a member of a
typographical union. The publisher, by which claimant was employed, ceased
publication, intending to merge soon thereafter with other metropolitan
newspapers. Claimant became unemployed concurrently with the cessation of
operations by his employer on or about April 24, 1966. He was never recalled to
work thereafter and consequently he has not been rehired by his former employer
or its successor. It was determined initially by the local offices involved
that there was a loss of employment due to an industrial controversy by the
employees of the papers intended to be merged.</span><span style='font-size:

be pre-dated to April 25, 1966 and that he be allowed benefits from April 25
through June 5. His request was denied and he was ruled ineligible for benefits
for the period from April 25 through June 5, 1966, on the ground that he had
failed to comply with registration requirements.</span><span style='font-size:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Other persons employed
by the newspaper publishers which had ceased operations pending the
commencement of operations by the proposed merged employer, filed for benefits
soon after their employment was terminated and the local offices where such
claims had been filed issued initial determinations suspending the benefit
rights for a period of seven weeks of all of those claimants, who, it had
concluded, had lost their employment as a result of the existence of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed. In
those instances in which such initial determinations were issued and the
affected claimants made no protest to the initial determinations, they were
instructed, in accordance with the procedure applicable in such instances, to
refrain from again reporting to the respective local offices until the
expiration of the suspension period. Several months later, the representatives
of the Industrial Commissioner reviewed the circumstances under which those
claimants who had filed for benefits had lost their employment and on the basis
of such review, it was concluded that all of those persons who were not rehired
by the merged firm after the differences between management and labor were
resolved, had not initially lost their employment due to the existence of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed, but
rather that they had lost their employment because, as a result of the merger,
their jobs had been abolished. Accordingly, the Commissioner's representatives
revised the initial determinations suspending the benefit rights of such
claimants who were then found to have lost their employment under
non-disqualifying conditions and held that the benefit rights of such claimants
were not subject to suspension and they were eligible for benefits from the
date of their respective filings, provided they met all of the other qualifying
conditions of the Law. In those instances, where claimants had filed for
benefits during the period originally designated as a suspension period and had
not reported thereafter until the conclusion of the suspension period, the
Commissioner’s representatives excused their failure to comply with reporting
requirements. However, in those instances where a former employee of the involved
newspaper publishers failed to file any claim for benefits within the period
designated as the suspension period, his failure to file was, in the absence of
good cause for the omission, not excused.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

failure to file for benefits prior to June 6, 1966 by alleging that shortly
after he became unemployed, he telephoned to the local office to inquire
whether persons who are unemployed because of a strike were entitled to
benefits for seven weeks thereafter and he allegedly was informed that they
were not. He also knew from a previous filing in 1964, when he had lost his
employment because of a strike in the establishment in which he was then
employed, that his benefit rights would be suspended for seven weeks. Moreover,
he received confirmation of the fact that one who loses his employment due to
an industrial controversy in the establishment in which he is employed is
suspended from receiving benefits for seven weeks thereafter because he had
been informed by several of his co-workers that their benefit rights had been
suspended in April 1966. Accordingly, he concluded that it was useless for him

without a sufficient basis in law or fact. From the foregoing, it is obvious
that the filing of a claim for benefits is a condition precedent to the
establishment of a claim for benefits and that no claimant is entitled to
benefits unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the omission was due to
&quot;good cause.&quot; Similarly, it is obvious that the commissioner has the
legal authority to excuse or refuse to excuse a failure to file or a failure to

basis to support the referee’s conclusion that the Commissioner’s actions were
arbitrary because of the alleged similarity in the circumstances of those who
had not reported during the suspension period after having filed for benefits
and claimant who had neither filed nor reported. There is no similarity in the
two situations. Those claimants who had filed but failed to report during the
suspension period were acting in accordance with specific instructions from the
Commissioner’s representatives that it was unnecessary for time to report
during the suspension period so long as they did not protest the initial
determination and thereby, in effect, agreed that they could accumulate no
credit for benefits during such suspension period. In the instance of the
claimant, however, he had received no such instructions. He acted on his own
initiative and in accordance with his own judgment as to the necessity for
complying with the legal requirement for filing for benefits. His failure to
file a claim deprived the Commissioner’s representatives of an opportunity of
initially evaluating the facts and circumstances which had caused the
termination of his employment to permit a conclusion as to whether he was one
who had lost his employment because of the existence of an industrial
controversy in the establishment in which he was employed. There is thus a
clear difference in both situations and consequently, there was a real basis
for the denial by the Industrial Commissioner of claimant’s request for
pre-dating his claim and yet excusing the failure to report of those who had
filed. Such actions by the Commissioner are neither arbitrary nor capricious.</span><span

regard to this regulation. It appears that claimant herein should have at least
gone to the local office shortly after the date of the commencement of the
strike and satisfied any doubt in his mind as to the time he should file an
application for benefits. The strike started on September 27 and it was not
until November 17 that claimant first appeared at the local office. Under these

foregoing, it is unnecessary to decide whether, in fact, the facts and

identical with those surrounding the termination of employment of those
claimants in whose cases the Commissioner had issued the revised initial
determinations of eligibility for benefits. Inasmuch as we have concluded that
the denial of claimant’s request for the pre-dating of his claim was a
reasonable exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion, it follows that
claimant’s failure to file for benefits within the period now claimed by him,
renders him ineligible for benefits for the period April 25, 1966 through June

general interest to claimant’s newspaper for publication. Claimant as editor of
the paper wrote between ten and twenty unsigned editorials a year on subjects
confined to matters of local interest in the community, which the newspaper
served.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

did not have complete authority to write whatever he chose in the editorial

the paper’s policy on community issues was to be discussed with the editorial
director. Editorials that involved a statement of basic or political policy
were required to be discussed among the publisher’s executives with due
consideration given to the views of the editor. The employer required that
claimant’s published statements be in agreement with the basic policy of the
paper on community questions as determined by its executive officers. During
the period that claimant served as editor of the paper, he submitted the
editorials he wrote on local issues to the editorial director of the publisher

proposed editorial to his supervisor and the editorial director. Claimant and the
officers of the publisher discussed claimant’s proposed editorial at length but
claimant, despite his insistence, was unable to persuade the executives or to
obtain their approval for publication of his editorial. Approval was denied
because the editorial director and the publisher’s president, who was a long
time resident of the community, chose to endorse the slate of candidates
opposed to those preferred by claimant. Claimant took the position that since
his employer insisted on endorsing the candidates whom he personally opposed
and whom he believed to be less desirable for the benefit of the community, he
could no longer remain as editor of the newspaper in that community.</span><span

rejected the employer’s offer of a transfer. He left his employment because he

absolve him from compliance, because regardless of the merits of the

employer’s newspaper was entirely the employer’s (<u>Matter of Day</u>, 26 A.D.

cannot justify his voluntary leaving of his employment for his personal reasons

Monday pursuant to Section 24 of the General Construction Law. In addition,
considering the fact that the claimant never worked for the employer on Sundays
and the employer’s establishment is closed for business on Sundays and normally
opened for business on Mondays, and since the employer gave the employees a
paid day off on Monday, October 13, in observance of the Columbus Day holiday,
I find that the paid holiday was Monday, October 13 rather than Sunday, October

tracks and public thoroughfares. Wheat, received from ships and railroad cars
and stored and blended in the two grain elevators, is transported in the overhead
bridges to other storage areas and to the several mills and plants. Originally,
the elevators had been owned and operated by several corporations having
nothing to do with the manufacture of wheat products. They supplied grain to
the mill but, as one witness noted, &quot;[h]istorically, they were separate

&quot;place or situs&quot; as the mills and processing and packaging plants –
which, as already noted, are sprawled over a wide area – and, hence, that they
constitute the same establishment. The elevators are removed by up to 400 feet
from the mills and processing buildings and variously separated from them by
three or four sets of tracks of a railroad spur, by another nine sets of
railroad tracks and by public streets. Their geographic separateness is further
emphasized by the fact that the grain elevators were originally owned and
operated for many years by commercial elevator companies completely separate
and apart from the mill until General Mills, the holding company, ultimately
acquired all of the various outfits. In addition, other than the fact that one
longshoreman went daily to the two mill tanks – with which non-striking
employees had some contacts – to measure grain, there were no working relations
whatsoever between the striking and non-striking employees.</span><span

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>All in all, the Appeal
Board’s finding of a separate &quot;establishment&quot; was fully warranted by
the geographic location of the elevators. Moreover, such a conclusion better
accords with the legislative design of the statute and the construction which
this court has placed upon it than does the Appellate Division’s contrary
holding. The suspension provision should be &quot;narrowly construed,&quot; we
declared in&nbsp;<u>Ferrara</u>, &quot;to effectuate the broad humanitarian
objects sought to be achieved by the statute,&quot; and this, we added, is best
done by defining &quot;establishment&quot; in &quot;geographic terms&quot; (10
NY 2d, at p. 8).&nbsp;<u>4</u>/ Unemployment Insurance provisions were intended
to protect workers who lost their employment through no fault of their own.
Striking employees, the court continued, were excepted from coverage for a
seven-week period in the &quot;interest of preserving (governmental) neutrality
between a contesting employer and employees and irrespective of individual
need***. The State must stand aside, at least during the early stages of an
industrial controversy, and thereby avoid the imputation that a dispute may be
financed through unemployment insurance benefits&quot; (10 NY 2d, at p. 8; see,
also&nbsp;<u>Matter of Heitzenrater</u>&nbsp;[<u>Hooker Chem. Corp</u>.], 19 NY
2d 1,7). Non-striking employees in the same &quot;establishment&quot; with the
strikers were similarly excepted, presumably either to prevent collusion
between strikers and those who, by reason of their close proximity, might be in
a position to gain from a strike or to induce the non-strikers to bring pressure
to bear on their striking co-workers to terminate the strike. Be that as it
may, a restricted construction of the term &quot;establishment&quot; to apply
to immediate geographic situs of the striking employees goes far toward
preventing the harmful effects of a loss of employment benefits upon innocent
and uninvolved employees.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board, which reversed a Referee’s decision sustaining an initial determination,
which disqualified claimant from benefits on the ground that she had refused an
offer of employment without good cause. (Labor Law, §593, subd. 2, par [d]),
whether upon permanent or temporary employment, because substantial fringe
benefits customarily paid or supplied (after three months) for permanent
employment in her occupation were not provided for the temporary job offered
her. The parties are in substantial agreement as to the facts and appeal

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Claimant, a keypunch
operator, could not return to her employment at the termination of a maternity
leave of absence because her employer had meanwhile moved its entire keypunch
system from the area. Kelly Girl Service, an employment contractor for
temporary services, offered her six to eight weeks’ employment with another
employer as a key punch operator at the prevailing wage, which was at
substantially the same rate as that paid in that occupation for permanent and
temporary employment alike. Claimant refused the offer, stating her reasons for
desiring permanent only. As herein before indicated, the board found that the
prospective employer would not have provided the usual fringe benefits granted
by employers for similar work on a permanent basis, the benefits including free
hospital and medical insurance, participation in a retirement plan, paid
holidays and accrued vacation credits; and the board thereupon
&quot;conclude(d) that the conditions offered to claimant were substantially
less favorable to claimant then those prevailing for similar work in the
locality.&quot;</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It seems to us important
to note that the board later found that these &quot;fringe benefits of a
substantial nature are provided to persons employed in similar occupations in
the locality&nbsp;<u>for a period of three months or more</u>&quot;. (Emphasis
supplied). It appears elsewhere that fringe benefits are not customarily
offered for temporary jobs in claimant’s occupation, for reasons that are
obvious and understandable. The board observed that claimant’s acceptance of
the temporary job would have deferred her commencement of the three-month
qualifying period in a permanent job, had one become available; but there is no
suggestion that claimant would not, or could not have left the temporary
position for a permanent job at any time. Moreover, it is clear, first, that
the mere possibility of a permanent opening might not be fulfilled, even within
the maximum period for payment of unemployment insurance benefits; and, second,
that at least at the time of claimant’s refusal of the temporary employment
neither the wage rate nor &quot;the conditions offered [were] substantially
less favorable&quot; (par. [d],&nbsp;<u>supra</u>) than those obtaining at the
outset of a possible permanent employment and for three months thereafter; and
to that extent no justification for the refusal existed, within the literal
meaning of the statute. Our decision rests also upon the additional and broader
ground that the rule enunciated by the board in this case contravenes the basic
intendment and the spirit of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Since the
enactment of the statute, fringe benefits have no greatly increased in number,
nature and diversity and have been extended to so may employments that, in
general, they have come to constitute one of the major factors in
employer-employee relations and have become of such value as to render the
adjectival &quot;fringe&quot; something of a misnomer. As claimant contends,
such benefits &quot;are to be considered part of over-all compensation.&quot; (<u>Matter
of Asserson</u>&nbsp;[<u>Catherwood</u>], 25 AD 2d 895). We recognize, too, the
validity of claimant’s additional argument that &quot;the statute makes no
distinction between temporary and permanent employment&quot; (<u>Matter of
Lehrman</u>&nbsp;[<u>Corsi</u>], 281 App. Div. 936); but this cuts both ways
and requires that only for a substantial reason may an unemployed claimant
refuse temporary employment, even of one day’s or one week’s duration (<u>Matter
of Walls</u>&nbsp;[<u>Catherwood</u>], 26 AD 2d 883;&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Kotlowitz</u>, [<u>Catherwood</u>], 24 AD 2d 813) or, indeed, refuse a
permanent job paying prevailing wages but &quot;less than a job which is not
available for which claimant’s skill might qualify him if such a job were
available&quot; (<u>Matter of Matyevish</u>&nbsp;[<u>Catherwood</u>], 15 AD 2d
387, 388). The effect of the board’s holding in this case would be to permit a
claimant to obtain unemployment insurance benefits despite his refusal of a
temporary job, for which he is fitted and which pays the prevailing wage rate,
and to permit him to wait indefinitely for a job to become available which
shall pay not only the prevailing wage but, after three months, fringe benefits
as well, provided, of course, the claimant’s employment shall survive such
three-month qualifying period.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The matter of temporary
employment poses for this claimant, as doubtless for many others, a manifest
problem, and one evoking sympathetic consideration; but it seems rather clear
to us that the board’s decision does not constitute a proper and authorized
solution when we recall the purpose and intent of the unemployment insurance
statute. The act was designed to &quot;lighten (the) burden&quot; of
&quot;involuntary unemployment&quot; which &quot;so often falls with crushing
force upon the unemployed worker and his family&quot;. (Labor Law §501.)
&quot;The primary purpose of the law is to ease the hardship of involuntary
unemployment due to economic conditions or other conditions beyond the control
of the employee. It was not intended as a substitute for a minimum wage law.
***It was not intended to regulate wages – it was intended as a substitute for
the complete loss of wages forced upon an employee. (Labor Law §501, 522)&quot;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: In Appeal Board
138,551 and 138,571, we held that a paid holiday occurring on Sunday and
celebrated publicly on Monday makes claimant ineligible for benefits on that
Sunday and not on Monday, when Monday is declared a public holiday. Since
Christmas fell on Sunday, December 25, 1966, although celebrated publicly on Monday,
December 26, 1966 and New Year’s Day fell on Sunday, January 1, 1967, although
celebrated publicly on Monday, January 2, 1967, we conclude that claimant
received holiday pay for Sunday, December 25, 1966, and Sunday, January 1,
1967. Therefore, the initial determinations of the local office holding
claimant ineligible to receive benefits effective December 26, 1966 and January
2, 1967, on the ground that such days were paid holidays, for which no benefits
are to be paid, should be modified to make the same effective December 25, 1966
and January 1, 1967, respectively, in accordance with the above decisions.</span><span

market. Subsequently, his former employer rehired him as a meat grinder for the
summer season. There is no evidence purporting to indicate that employers of
persons in claimant’s occupation are unwilling or reluctant to hire persons
with claimant’s skills unless they are given reasonable assurance that the
prospective employee is ready, willing and able to continue in such employment
on a permanent basis, nor does it appear that an expressed intention to
continue in the employment for a limited period would create a barrier to the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Thus, the issue is here
squarely presented, as to whether a restriction such as that imposed by
claimant produces his unavailability for employment during that period of time
when he is actually prepared to work. In our view, as long as it appears that
claimant’s opportunities for employment are not unreasonably limited by his
restriction to continue in employment for a limited period of time and he has
not yet approached his earnings limitation, he is actually in the labor market
and is available for employment within the purview of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. If, of course, the restriction which claimant imposes creates
such a barrier as to foreclose him from reasonable prospects of procuring work
either because he has already earned the maximum which he desires to earn for
the year or is very close to reaching that point or his occupation is such that
his expressed restriction to work only a limited period of time militates
against his prospects for procuring work, then in such events, he has
effectively produced his unavailability for employment. Such is not the
situation in the instant case and therefore we conclude that claimant’s
restriction did not produce his unavailability for employment during the period
here in issue.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

construction company on a &quot;shape up&quot; basis. They reported each day to
the employer’s central garage and office for their work assignments. When they
worked, each claimant drove an empty truck from the garage to one of several
job sites in the Bronx where the trucks would be loaded with rock and dirt to
be dumped either at their same site, at the other job site, or at some other
location designed by the employer. Although neither claimant worked regularly
at any one location, each performed a substantial portion of his work at the
two Bronx job sites prior to the strike. Occasionally, the employer rented one
of its trucks for a day to another contract and supplied one of the claimants
as the truck driver. At the end of each workday, claimants returned the empty
trucks to the garage.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

at the central garage and office, they were told by the dispatcher that there
was no work for them because the employer’s operating engineers had struck and
picketed the two job sites in the Bronx. There was no strike, lockout or
industrial controversy at the employer’s central garage and office, which was,
located a substantial distance from each of the two Bronx job sites. Claimants

the garage to the locations assigned and returned the empty trucks to the

the job sites, prior to the industrial controversy which occurred there when
the operating engineers struck and picketed, we conclude that these job sites

schedule their vacation with their supervisors. This could only mean that their
vacations would be on days other than days of employment. This is fully in
accord with the provisions of the union contract that those whose services are
required during the vacation period will be given vacations arranged by the
employer on consecutive days between May 1 and December 31. I find therefore,
that it was the intention of the parties that vacation periods be exclusive of

of the opinion that it was the intent of the Legislature in amending the Law to
concern itself specifically with an individual’s factors and opportunities, as
well as those in the field in general. The program under Section 599 of the
Unemployment Insurance Law as amended in March 1966 was geared for individuals
such as the claimant in this case. The Industrial Commissioner is charged with
the responsibility of carrying out the provisions of this Section, and after
careful investigation, taking into consideration all relevant factors as
authorized by this statute, approved claimant’s application to take this
vocational training. It has not been shown that the action taken by the
Industrial Commissioner was either arbitrary, capricious or that he abused his
discretion. There is no reason therefore why the judgment of the Industrial Commissioner

from receiving benefits effective February 3, 1967, because of refusal of
employment without good cause. He had no employment between February 3, 1967
and February 20, 1967. During the period from February 20,1967, through March
3, 1967, he received vacation pay in the sum of $364.80. This vacation pay was
payable under a union contract between the union and claimant’s employer.
Claimant conceded that the receipt of the vacation pay rendered him ineligible
to receive benefits for that period because it was paid vacation period for
which no benefits are payable.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:

20 through March 3, which had been the designated paid vacation period, terminated
the disqualification resulting from his refusal of employment on February 3
notwithstanding that, admittedly, he performed no work subsequent to February
3. He maintains that because the vacation pay constitutes remuneration as
defined by Law, it follows that he had sufficient remuneration after February 3
to terminate the disqualification and, additionally, that because the receipt
by him of such vacation payment necessarily precluded his eligibility for
benefits during that period, he must be deemed to have been not totally
unemployed in that period and hence employed. We see no merit to the contention
so advanced by claimant.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Section 593.2 of the Law
provides that a disqualification resulting from a refusal of employment without
good cause shall remain effective &quot;until he (claimant) has&nbsp;<u>subsequently</u>&nbsp;worked
in employment on not less than three days of each of four weeks or earned
remuneration of at least $200.&quot; (Underscoring supplied.) The clear intent
of the statute was to continue the disqualification of the claimant who refuses
employment without good cause until he obtains re-employment which produces the
minimum requirement either in time of money as set forth in the statute. It
could not have been contemplated that the mere receipt by such a claimant of a
payment for a designated period in pursuance of a contractual arrangement with
his prior employer could be used to satisfy the purpose sought to be
accomplished by the statute. In essence, the statute is a recognition of the
fact that because of the refusal of employment without good cause, the
unemployment which thereafter ensues is no longer attributable to no fault of
the claimant, and that, consequently, the claimant should not be entitled to
benefits until other employment for a minimum time, or which produces minimum
remuneration, would result in a new period of unemployment after such
subsequent employment terminates. We think that this is evidence when
significance is given to the word &quot;subsequently&quot; which is included in
the statute. In our view, to effectuate the purpose of the statue, the
pertinent clause must be read as &quot;until he has subsequently * * * earned
remuneration of at lease $200.&quot;</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>The vacation payment
which, claimant received was not earned by him subsequently to February 3 the
date of his refusal of employment. The payment resulted from the services he
had performed prior to February 3. The ineligibility during the designated
vacation period for which he received the vacation payment did not result from
his employment within the statutory definition of that term, but the
ineligibility resulted from a specific statutory mandate which provides that no
benefits shall be paid for such period (Section 591.3). The fact that the
statute provides that no paid vacation day shall be considered a day of total
unemployment does not necessarily require that the converse be accepted;
namely, that a paid vacation day should be considered a day of employment.
Thus, in an analogous situation, we held that a vacation payment was not to be
included as &quot;compensation&quot; in determining whether claimant was paid
aggregate compensation in an amount would preclude his accumulation of
effective days for eligibility under Section 523 of the Law. (See Appeal Board
100,956A and 124,517.) We believe that the same criteria must be applied in the
instant case and we therefore conclude that, notwithstanding the receipt by
claimant of vacation pay of more than $200 for a period subsequent to February
3, 1967, he did not subsequently earn remuneration of at least $200, and that,
therefore, the disqualification effective February 3, 1967, remain in effect
and was not terminated.</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
