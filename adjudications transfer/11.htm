Valley Stream was employed by a steamship company in New York from September
19, 1949, up to July 20,1951, at a final wage of $225 a month. He left his
employment because the employer had failed to increase his wages and because
his hours of employment were changed and this increased his travel time. The
claimant had received his last raise in December 1950, at which time his wages
were increased by $15 a month. In March 1951, the claimant spoke to the
employer about another increase. He was told that the matter would have to be
presented to the Wage Stabilization Board and that the employer would attempt
to increase his wage up to $25 a month. His superior then recommended an
additional $15 increase. That a could not take effect until the entire wage
plan of the employer had been approved by the Stabilization Board which was not
done until after the claimant had left his job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pennsylvania Station, which did not arrive at Valley Stream until 7:07 p.m.

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The issue in this case
is not a new one. It is whether or not a claimant who has suffered the penalty
prescribed in the Law for voluntarily leaving employment without good cause may
subsequently be subjected to another penalty or disqualification for refusal to
accept a former employer’s offer of the same employment. We do not deem as
applicable herein the line of cases cited by the employer to the effect that a
single disqualification or penalty may be imposed against a claimant who
refuses to accept an offer of employment made by a former employer. In those
situations the usual tests of the suitability of the job offer are the sole
criteria and we have so held. Here we are concerned with the penalty intended
to be imposed by the Legislature against claimants who for reasons not adjudged
to be good cause voluntarily quit their jobs. That question was first presented
to this Board in 1941 when a claimant who had voluntarily left her job without

return, was disqualified from benefits for refusal of employment without good
cause. In that case (Appeal Board, 6631-41) we said in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

voluntarily leaving employment without good cause, the question arises in this

employee, nor shall he be credited with serving any part of the waiting period
provided by subdivision one of section five hundred and four until six weeks

the Law a new conception, not unknown in the field of unemployment insurance,
but hitherto not found in the New York Law. Prior thereto, no penalty was
prescribed in connection with a voluntary leaving. However, an applicant for
benefits under such circumstances incurred the risk of a disqualification of
his benefit rights in the event of his refusal to return to his old job, if it
was still open. We question seriously the right of the local office, under the
circumstances now under consideration, to invoke the more drastic penalty of
disqualification for refusal, rather than the lesser penalty of a six weeks’
disqualification period provided for a voluntary quit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

opinion that the Legislature, in providing a separate penalty for a voluntary

situation where it is disclosed that an applicant for benefits has voluntarily
left his job without good cause. By the same token, it was not intended that
some other penalty, especially a more severe penalty, should be substituted in
its place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

social reasons behind the amendment gives added support to our conclusion. We
believe that the Legislature recognized that employees may choose to leave
their employment for reasons personal to themselves, although such reasons are
not such as would warrant the immediate payment of unemployment insurance
benefits. While the Legislature, it seems to us, did not desire to subsidize
such self-made unemployment, it seems equally clear that it did not intend to
shackle employees to distasteful jobs. As to the penalty, which is to flow, it
has spoken. It could not have intended to countenance a result whereby, through
the medium of a futile job offer and the reiteration by the employee of his
reasons for not returning to work at the job he has quit, a different and more
drastic penalty is arrived at.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;This case poses
directly the question of whether a claimant who has suffered a disqualification
for voluntarily leaving a job can also be disqualified for refusal to return to
the same job. Here the claimant advances the same reasons for her refusal to
return to her job as she advanced for leaving it. To all intents and purposes,
her leaving and her refusal to return are part and parcel of the same act. This
leads us to a consideration of whether this is not a case of imposing a double
penalty for a single offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

distinguished between a voluntary leaving and a refusal to accept employment by
providing separate penalties therefore. In this connection, the following
language of the Missouri appeal Tribunal, U.C.I.S., Benefit Series, 5104,
(Affirmed by the Unemployment Compensation Commission of Missouri, Case No.
358) is singularly appropriate:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a claimant quits work voluntarily and without good cause, the voluntary quit is
the proximate cause of his subsequent unemployment. Because that unemployment
may be, partly at least, through his own fault, the Law requires the assessment
of a penalty. Can the employer then, by requesting that claimant return to
work, effect the assessment of an additional penalty by forcing claimant to
return to a job he has already quit and for which he is already punished? Would
not such a procedure in effect be equivalent to saying that a voluntary quit is
the same as a refusal of suitable work, when the Legislature clearly declares
that it is not? Would it not in effect be assessing a double penalty for
actually one offense? Would it not eventually lead to an ignoring of the
penalty prescribed under the voluntary quit section and to substituting the
more severe penalty under the refusal of work subsection? The referee finds, in
the instant case, that the employer seeks to have claimant punished for
refusing to return to a job which he found objectionable when he quit that job.
The claims deputy found that claimant, did, in fact, leave work without good
cause and assessed a proper penalty. It would be inequitable under the
circumstances to penalize the claimant again when already one penalty was
assessed for what amounts to the same act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the proper administration of what seemed to be conflicting subsections, the

two penalties may not be administered for the same offense, and that in
selecting the proper subsection, the claims deputy should determine that

was without authority, under the circumstances of this case, to impose upon

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>This result has since
been uniformly followed and applied by the administrative and adjudicating
agencies in this State. We are not persuaded by any of the authorities cited on
this appeal that such a result is contrary to the spirit or the letter of the New
York State Unemployment Insurance Law. The penalty for refusal of employment is
one of the most drastic provided in the Law. No decision has been called to our
attention in any jurisdiction where a claimant who has suffered the prescribed
penalty for voluntary leaving of employment has been subjected again to an
indefinite disqualification period for what amounts to the same act. We are not
impressed with the relevancy of the employer’s argument in this case that the
Legislature never intended to pay unemployment insurance benefits to persons
who are voluntarily unemployed and who could have been working at a job for
which they are reasonably fitted by training and experience but for their
refusal. Although involuntary unemployment is the factor that prompted the
Legislature to enact the Unemployment Insurance Law (see Section 501 of the
Labor Law), nevertheless, when it comes to the denial of benefits, we must be
governed by the specific provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law. These
provisions clearly indicate many situations were claimants, although they might
have been employed but for their refusal, nevertheless are entitled to benefits
under the Law. There are four specific instances where claimants may refuse
employment and still be entitled to benefits under Section 593 of the
Unemployment Insurance Law. Likewise, a claimant who voluntarily leaves his
employment is entitled to benefits after a disqualification period of six
weeks. In the last mentioned case, claimant’s unemployment is clearly voluntary,
nevertheless, the Legislature required the payment of benefits to such persons
after a period of 42 days. (Cf.&nbsp;<u>McFarland vs. Unemployment Compensation
Board of Review</u>, 158 Pa. Super. 418; 45a (2d) 423; Benefit Series Vol. 9
#8, page 97). The initial determination of the local office ruling claimant
eligible for benefits is hereby sustained. The decision of the referee is
affirmed. (November 30, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The claimant is a
laundry worker. In January 1951 she voluntarily left her job with the Dates
Laundry Service where she had been employed since 1946. She filed a claim for
unemployment insurance benefits effective January 29, 1951 but the same was
disallowed on the ground she had voluntarily left her employment without good
cause. She was ruled disqualified from benefits for a period of 42 days from
the time she had voluntarily left the employment. On March 21 the period of
disqualification having ended, she filed a new claim for benefits. The Division
of Placement and Unemployment Insurance referred the claimant back to her
former employer, the Dates Laundry Service. Claimant interviewed the employer
and refused to accept the new employment which was tendered. The new employment
was substantially the same as the previous work. The wage rate could have been
found to have been slightly lower and full seniority rights were not to be
allowed, which differences the employer claimed to have been due to the
obligations of the contract it had with the labor union. On the question of
claimant’s further disqualification for benefits after thus refusing the
further offer of employment, the initial determination of the Industrial
Commissioner was that the claimant was not disqualified by this refusal of employment
because she had already and previously been disqualified by leaving the employ
of the same employer without good cause and had undergone the penalty of the
statutory period of disqualification. The employer objected to this ruling and
requested a hearing. The referee sustained the determination and the Appeal
Board adopted his findings. From that determination employer appeals. No
question is raised here that the employment offered was not one for which
claimant was reasonably qualified by training and experience. The question is
narrowed down by both parties to the problem of law whether a claimant who has
once been disqualified for benefits because he leaves employment without
&quot;good cause&quot; and who refuses a new offer of employment by the same
employer for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience undergoes
a further disqualification. The answer to this question is, we think, to be
sought by reading the words of the statute. The Unemployment Insurance Law
(Labor Law, Article 18) §593, provides that if a voluntary separation from
employment is not for good cause benefits shall not be payable for 42 days.
Thus, and some other subjects are treated in subdivision 1 of the section under
the classification of &quot;voluntary separation.&quot; Under quite a distinct
statutory treatment the subject of &quot;refusal of employment&quot; is dealt
with in subdivision 2 of the same section. Benefits are not to be payable to a
claimant &quot;who without good cause refuses to accept an offer of employment
for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience.&quot; There is
nothing in all this to suggest a legislative intention to provide that where a
claimant has been disqualified by a voluntary separation from employment he
cannot be further disqualified by refusing without just cause to take the same
employment offered by the same employer. The arrangement to offer the
employment here was made through the Division of Placement and Unemployment
Insurance to the claimant. The procedure under official regulation and control
followed the general statutory scheme. In every respect the employment was one
for which the claimant was reasonably qualified. It literally came within the
conditions described in the statute dealing with &quot;refusal of
employment&quot;. It is not found as a fact that claimant was not qualified
with the statute for the employment offered, or that it was not the kind of
employment to which the statute refers. Nor is it found that the differential
between the status of the employment claimant left and that offered was itself
a basis of refusal for good cause. The controlling, and to us it seems the
only, ground for the determination of the referee and appeal Board was that the
separation from the employment in the first place and the refusal to accept the
new offer were so related as to be part of the same act. The penalty for the
separation was deemed to cover the refusal. The referee’s language describes
the theory of decision. &quot;To all intents and purposes,&quot; he said
&quot;her leaving and her refusal to return appear to be a part and parcel of
the same act.&quot; Both were &quot;a single offense.&quot; The statute,
however, carefully separates voluntary separation from refusal of employment.
If they are separate events, as they certainly are in this record, they may not
be given unitary treatment. The Division of Placement and Unemployment
Insurance itself set in motion the &quot;offer of employment&quot; which was
distinct in time and circumstance from the original separation. This offer of
employment, even though from the former employer, fulfilled the statutory
definition of an offer of employment and the effect of the separately provided
penalty for &quot;refusal of employment&quot; cannot be avoided by the fact
that the State agency selected the same employer to make an offer of renewed
instead of entirely new employment. We do not hold that an employee who
separates himself from employment without just cause would never have just
cause for not taking an offer of re-employment in the same place. The statute
sets forth a list of reasons for &quot;refusal to accept employment&quot; which
are not to be regarded as a result not for good cause. But the list is not
exclusive by its very terms but merely fixes certain negative criteria. The
appellant argues for the exclusiveness of the enumeration but the statute does
not read that way. There may be other reasons for refusal recognizable as
well-grounded and for good cause by the Commissioner or the Board. But that is
not the theory of this decision. The theory is, rather, that there is double
penalty for the same act. The acts are, however, not only separable in the
statutory scheme, but Section 593 specifically separates them and their
consequences. The decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board should be
reversed with costs to the appellant against the Industrial Commissioner and
the proceeding remitted to the Industrial Commissioner to proceed in accordance
with this decision. (June 13, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are structural steel workers and members of the Buffalo Local of the Bridge,
Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers Union. They obtain work through their
union and at the time in question were employed in erection work on the
premises of the steel plant of B. Steel Company located in Lackawanna, New
York. The employer has a verbal agreement with the union. At 12:01 a.m. on
October 1, 1949 the steel workers in that plant, all members of a steel
workers’ union went out on strike. On their next working day, which was October
3, 1949, the ironworkers were not allowed to pass the strikers’ picket line.
However, an agreement was reached between the company and the steel workers’
union permitting the ironworkers to resume work on October 4, 1949. Some
ironworkers continued to work thereafter throughout the entire strike period on
the employer’s projects in the premises of the steel mill. Claimants were
notified that there was no work for them on these projects due to shortage of
steel and they did not resume work there during the strike. Claimants filed
claims for unemployment insurance benefits. Initial determinations were issued
suspending their benefit rights for seven weeks effective October 1, 1949
because they lost their employment due to the strike. Claimants protested and
requested hearings. The B. Steel Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, is one of
the largest manufacturers of steel in the United States. It is the subsidiary
of the B. Steel Corporation, a holding company incorporated in Delaware. The B.
Steel Company (Inc.) is authorized to do business in the State of New York. It
has ten vice presidents of whom one, whose office is in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, is in charge of steel production and manufacturing activities.
The steel mill at Lackawanna, New York is in charge of a General Manager who is
responsible to that vice president. In addition to the fabrication of steel,
the B. Steel Company engages in the construction business performing
construction work throughout New York State and the United States for anyone
who may wish to contract with it. This branch of the employer’s enterprise is
known as the Fabricated Steel Construction Division, Erection Department. All
of the instant claimants worked for this Division. Construction jobs are
supervised by a job foreman who has a temporary office at the location of the
work and who reports to a District Manager of Erection who has offices in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This District Manager reports to the General Manager
of Erection, who in turn reports to the General Manager, Fabricated Steel
Construction, who reports to the vice president. The last three named have
offices in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Claimant, R.E.L. has worked for the
Erection Division for 28 years. On many occasions he reported for assignment to
work at the Pittsburgh office of the Erection Division from which office he has
been sent to jobs throughout the territory east of the Mississippi River. On a
previous occasion when the ironworkers were on strike, the steel workers
continued to work throughout the continuation of such strike. The instant
claimants contribute their loss of employment to the lack of steel and not to
the industrial controversy between the company and the steel workers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The issue to be
decided in this appeal is whether or not claimants lost their employment due to
a strike or industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed within the meaning of Section 592.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law.
Extended hearings were held in this case before the Board to determine whether
claimants were in the employ of the same corporation which operated the steel
mill at Lackawanna, New York and which was involved in an industrial
controversy with the steel workers’ union. The present record establishes that
the steel workers and the ironworkers, including claimants, were employed by B.
Steel Company, a Pennsylvania corporation. One question remains, however, to be
determined, and that is whether there was a strike or industrial controversy in
the &quot;establishment&quot; in which claimants were employed within the
meaning of Section 592.1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. This question was
the subject of a recent Court decision which we believe to be determinative of
the present case.&nbsp;<u>In the Matter of Machcinski, et al v. Ford Motor
Company</u>, 277 App. Div. 634, affirming Appeal Board, 20,456-49, the Court
sustained a ruling of this Board that workers laid off at the B. and G.I.
plants of the Ford Motor Company due to lack of work arising out of a strike at
the R.R. plant of that company, were not subject to the suspension provision
under Section 592.1 of the Law. The Court stated in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;Unemployment
compensation statutes were enacted in various States during a period of
distress and were designed to relieve the hardship caused by unemployment due
to no fault of the employee. The legislative purpose behind the enactment of
our act is to be found in the legislative declaration of public policy in
Section 501. There, the Legislature stated that in its considered judgment the
public good and the well-being of the wage earners of this State require the
enactment of this measure for the compulsory setting aside of financial
reserves for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.
This is a remedial statute, a humanitarian statute, and should be construed
accordingly. It is the general rule that a liberal construction is accorded
statutes which are regarded by courts as humanitarian or which are grounded on
a humane public policy. In the two cases that we are considering the unemployment
was involuntary. Those employees had nothing to do with the stoppage of work in
the Detroit plant. They were not consulted about the work stoppage or with the
prosecution of the strike and clearly they had nothing to do with the
settlement. They are the innocent victims of a situation wholly beyond their
control. The question which we have to decide is whether these claimants lost
their employment because of a strike in the establishment in which they were
employed within the meaning of section 592, subdivision 1 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the use of the word &quot;establishment&quot; to include all the plants of the
Ford Motor Company, situate as they are in so many states of the union and in
foreign countries. To adopt the appellant’s contention would require us to hold
that a few employees in any of the employer’s plants, in any part of this
country, can prevent the workers in the Buffalo and Green Island plants from
earning a livelihood or, in lieu thereof, from getting the insignificant amount
of unemployment insurance that is available to them under the statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the solution of the problem before us is to be found in determining from all
the facts available whether the Buffalo and Green Island plants under

not whether they are to be regarded as separate enterprises from the standpoint

construing the statute before us we approach the subject from the standpoint of
employment rather than management and in so doing we have no hesitancy in
concluding that the findings of the unemployment board are amply sustained by
the evidence.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Here the record is clear
that the claimants were employed by a separate branch or division of the
employer’s enterprise than that in, which the industrial controversy occurred.
Claimants had nothing to do with the stoppage of the work in the steel mill or
with the prosecution of the strike and likewise were innocent victims of a
situation wholly beyond their control. Accepting the reasoning of the court and
construing the statute from the standpoint of claimants’ employment, we
conclude that the steel mill and the Erection Division of the employer’s
enterprise are separate establishments for the purpose of the issue before us.
We accordingly hold that the instant claimants did not lose their employment
because of an industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were
employed, within the contemplation of Section 592.1 of the Law. The initial
determinations of the local office that claimants lost their employment as a
result of a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy in the
establishment in which they were employed are hereby overruled. The decision of
the referee is affirmed. Separate orders are to be entered in each case. (May

Opinion and Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The Bethlehem Steel
Co., Inc., is one of the largest manufacturers of steel in the United States.
It is one of several corporations involved in an intricate corporate setup, and
operates through several plants and offices. We are concerned primarily with
its plant located at Lackawanna, New York, and operated for the manufacture of
steel. The regular workers at that plant, engaged in the actual manufacture of
steel, are members of the steel workers union, and will hereinafter be referred
to as &quot;steel workers.&quot; The Bethlehem Steel Co., Inc., also engages in
construction work and the erection of the finished steel product in New York
State and elsewhere in the United States, for anyone who may wish to contract
with it for such work. The branch performing this work is known as the
Fabricated Steel Construction Division, Erection Department. It is not a
separate legal entity, but might be characterized as one branch or one
department of the company. The employees of this department, including these
claimants, are members of the Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers
Union, and will hereafter be designated as &quot;iron workers.&quot; At the
time involved here these claimants were employed in erection work on the
premises of the Bethlehem Steel Co., Inc., at Lackawanna, N.Y. They were
actually constructing approaches to the open hearths used in the manufacture of
steel. At 12:01 a.m., on October 1, 1949, the &quot;steel workers&quot; at the
Lackawanna plant went on strike. On their next working day, October 3, 1949,
the &quot;ironworkers&quot; were not allowed to cross the picket line. By
agreement, however the ironworkers were permitted to resume work on October 4,
1949. Some ironworkers continued to work throughout the strike on projects at
the employer’s plant at Lackawanna. These claimants were notified that there
was no work for them due to a shortage of steel, and they did not resume work
during the strike. When claimants filed claims for unemployment insurance
benefits, initial determinations were issued suspending their benefit rights
for seven weeks on the ground that they lost their employment because of an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed,
pursuant to Section 592, subd. 1 of the Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor Law,
Art. 18). An unemployment insurance referee overruled the initial
determinations, and the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed the
decision of the referee. The Industrial Commissioner has appealed to this court
from the decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board. The appeal board
based its decision solely on the ground that the strike or industrial
controversy was not in the &quot;establishment&quot; in which claimants were
employed, and relied for its authority upon Matter of&nbsp;<u>Machcinski (Ford
Motor Co. – Corsi</u>), 277 App. Div. 634. Strangely enough, both parties cite
the&nbsp;<u>Machcinski</u>&nbsp;case as authority for their respective
positions on this appeal. Under the unemployment insurance law adopted in this
State, it is of no consequence whatever that claimants were not on strike; that
they were employed in a separate branch of work, or that they lost their
employment through no fault of their own. Such elements were significantly
omitted by the Legislature when our statute was enacted. The&nbsp;<u>Machcinski</u>&nbsp;case
traces the origin, history and judicial development of unemployment insurance
laws with such completeness that it is unnecessary to repeat it here. It is to
be noted that the opinion of Mr. Justice Heffernan in that case expressly
states, at page 639: &quot;Under our law there is no requirement of
participation, financial aid or interest, nor is there any provision which
deems separate branches of work as separate factories, workshops or
premises.&quot; These claimants were employed by the same employer as the
striking steel workers, and were employed at the same plant and upon the
identical premises. The work which they were performing was as essential to the
production of steel at the plant as the work of the steel workers. The fact
that at other times they might be employed elsewhere is of no importance. We
must deal with the circumstances existing at the particular time when the
unemployment arose. At that time they were clearly employed in the
&quot;establishment&quot; where the industrial controversy arose. To hold
otherwise would be tantamount to a holding that employees regularly working at
the same plant but in a different department, or doing a different kind of
work, or belonging to a different union than striking employees, would not be
employed in the same &quot;establishment.&quot; Clearly this was not the intent
of the statute. Clearly the&nbsp;<u>Machcinski</u>&nbsp;case does not so hold,
but on the contrary expressly says: &quot;In our opinion we believe the word
‘establishment’ as used in the statute means the place where the employee was
last employed.&quot; The undisputed evidence establishes that the industrial
controversy occurred &quot;in the establishment&quot; where claimants were
employed. Another element is essential, however, before claimants’ benefit
rights may be suspended, i.e., claimants must have lost their employment
&quot;because of a strike, lockout or other industrial controversy.&quot; The
Board has found, in accordance with the evidence, that claimants’ unemployment
was due to a shortage of steel. No finding is made as to whether such shortage
was due to the strike at the Lackawanna plant or due to other causes. The
decision of the Appeal Board should be reversed on the law, and the cases
remitted to the Appeal Board for a determination and finding on that question,
without costs. (March 12, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which the claimant, the base period employer, and a representative of the
Industrial Commissioner appeared and testimony was taken. Claimant, a file
clerk and receptionist, refiled a claim effective December 17, 1951. By an
initial determination she was declared ineligible effective December 17 because
of unavailability, and she was charged with having wilfully made a false
statement to receive benefits, thereby reducing her rights to future benefits
by 80 effective days to be forfeited. At the hearing an additional initial
determination was interposed declaring claimant ineligible on the ground that
she could not establish a valid original claim for benefits since she had not
at least 20 weeks of covered employment in the base period. Claimant originally
filed a claim on October 8. In the period beginning with October 9, 1950, and
continuing through October 7, 1951, claimant had worked only 17 weeks. Such
employment had occurred at a resort hotel owned and operated by claimant’s
husband. In the 52-week period immediately prior to October 8, 1951, she was
declared ineligible on the ground that she could not then establish a valid
original claim for benefits. Claimant did not contest that initial
determination. Subsequently on December 17 claimant refiled her claim and
indicated that her last employment was at a decorating firm by which she was
allegedly employed on a part-time basis working two days of each week from the
week beginning October 5 through December 7. On January 14 claimant was interviewed
at length with respect to the employment in which she allegedly engaged
subsequent to October 1951. She reiterated that she had been employed by the
firm of decorators and stated that she had performed services as a receptionist
and had earned an aggregate of $160.50 and that no members of the decorating
firm were related to her and that she had procured the employment as a result
of recommendation by a friend. All of the statements with respect to claimant’s
alleged employment by the firm of decorators were false. Claimant was in fact
not employed by that firm at any time. The firm is operated by the husband of
claimant’s sister. When claimant ascertained in October 1941, that she lacked
the number of weeks of employment necessary to qualify for benefits she
requested her sister to enter on the payroll books of the decorating firm,
indications of claimant’s employment so that those records might be used to
establish claimant’s eligibility for benefits. Claimant received no wages from
such firm nor did she perform any services for the said firm. She had no
employment whatever following the close of the summer season of 1951 when
operations were suspended at the resort hotel operated by claimant’s husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It has been conclusively
established by competent proof that claimant did not actually engage in any
employment subsequent to October 1951. It was initially determined that
claimant did not have at least 20 weeks of covered employment in the 52-week
period prior to October 8, 1951, and such initial determination became final
and conclusive as a result of claimant’s failure to contest said initial
determination. Accordingly, since claimant had no actual employment subsequent
to October 8, 1951, it necessarily follows that on December 17 when she refiled
her claim she still lacked the required 20 weeks of covered employment to
qualify for benefits. I, therefore, hold that claimant could not establish a
valid original claim for benefits on the date of the refiling of her claim. Claimant's
statements on December 17, 1951, and January 14, 1952, with respect to her
alleged employment by the firm of decorators were patently false and were known
by the claimant to be false. The false statements were made by the claimant in
an attempt to further her scheme to meet the requirements of the Law, despite
the fact that she had not engaged in employment for the length of time required
by Law. Claimant’s actions were so flagrant that the imposition of the maximum
penalty provided by Law was warranted. The Commissioner’s representatives acted
within the authority conferred upon them by Section 594 of the Law in having
imposed a penalty of 80 effective days to be forfeited because of claimant’s
offense. The initial determination declaring claimant ineligible due to the
fact that she could not establish a valid original claim for benefits because
she lacked at least 20 weeks of covered employment and charging the claimant
with having wilfully made false statements to receive benefits, thereby reducing
her right to future benefits by 80 effective days to be forfeited is in all
respects sustained. It is unnecessary to pass upon the initial determination
declaring claimant ineligible because of unavailability. (May 12,1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which the claimant, an attorney for the employer and representatives of the
Industrial Commissioner appeared and testimony was taken. Claimant, a billing
clerk, filed a claim for benefits on July 27, 1950. By an initial determination,
her benefit rights were suspended from July 26 through September 12 for having
lost her employment as a result of the existence of an industrial controversy.
Claimant worked for a candy manufacturer which had entered into a collective
bargaining agreement with a certain union with respect to the terms and
conditions of employment affecting its production workers. In February 1940, an
election was conducted by the National Labor Relations Board and as a result
the Independent Confectionery Workers Union was certified as the sole
collective bargaining representative of all employees of the employer. From
1940 and up to the present time, the employer has had a valid and existing
contract with the said Independent Confectionery Workers Union. The collective
bargaining agreement contained &quot;no strike&quot; and
&quot;arbitration&quot; provisions. A new agreement in effect renewing the
terms of the existing agreement was executed on June 19, 1950, and because the
independent union referred to above had affiliated with Local 452 of the
American Federation of Labor, the latter assumed the obligations of the
collective bargaining agreement and was substituted as the bargaining agent. On
or about the same day when the renewal agreement was executed, another union
presently affiliated with the C.I.O., without having made any prior demands
upon the employer and without any prior notice, called a &quot;strike&quot; and
picketing was commenced at the employer’s plant. Due to such picketing, all
production in the employer’s plant ceased. The office of the employer continued
to function and persons employed in the office continued to work,
notwithstanding the cessation of production and the picketing which was in
progress. Claimant continued to work until about the day of her claim for
benefits, but because there was insufficient office work to be performed, the
various employees worked on a skip-day basis, and between the date of the
filing of the claim and September 1, claimant worked approximately two days of
each week. The employer commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, Kings County, to enjoin the picketing of its establishment and it
moved in such action for an injunction&nbsp;<u>pendente lite</u>, alleging
among other things that no labor dispute as defined by Section 876-a of the Civil
Practice Act existed at the employer’s establishment. The motion came on to be
heard before Mr. Justice Nova of the Supreme Court, Kings County, and after
reviewing the facts, the Court decided that there was no labor dispute at the
establishment of the employer and that the plaintiff in such action was
entitled to the injunctive relief which it sought. Accordingly, on September
11, 1950, an order was made and entered in the Supreme Court, Kings County,
granting the employer the injunction, which it sought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The Appeal Board had
occasion to pass upon the issue with respect to whether a former employee of
the instant employer lost his employment as a result of an industrial
controversy in 1940, when it appeared that the worker’s employment terminated
because picketing had continued by members of the union which had lost the
election conducted by the National Labor Relation Board, after the collective
bargaining agreement had been executed. Prior to the ruling by the Appeal
Board, an action was instituted by the employer in the Supreme court, Kings
County, in the same manner as the action referred to above was instituted by it
currently. There, as here, the Court granted the employer’s motion for a
temporary injunction and held that no labor dispute existed. The Appeal Board
Arrived at the same result as that arrived at by the Supreme Court and
accordingly ruled that no industrial controversy existed within the
contemplation of the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law. (Appeal
Board 3,103-40) The record herein fails to reveal the existence of any facts
that would tend to distinguish the situation currently existing from that which
existed at the time of the aforesaid ruling by the Appeal Board. It is
contended on behalf of the Industrial Commissioner that the Appeal Board, by
implication, overruled the principle enunciated by it in Appeal Board 3,103-40,
when it ruled in 12,521-45 that under the circumstances which there existed
there was in fact an industrial controversy which required the suspension of the
claimant’s benefit rights. Nowhere in the decision of the appeal Board in
12,521-45 is any reference made to its holding in the earlier case involving
the instant employer, (Appeal Board 3,103-40), nor is there any specific
statement by the Board to the effect it intended to overrule its earlier
decision. The facts in Appeal Board 12,521-45 are sufficiently different from
those that were presented to the Board in 3,103-40 to warrant the conclusion
that the two cases are not inconsistent and that the Board had no intention of
reversing itself. In view of the foregoing, I am constrained to follow the
ruling of the Board in appeal Board 3,103-40, since it involved the identical
employer and circumstances identical with those here shown to exist. The
initial determination is overruled. (March 30, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pattern maker in the dress industry from April 1946 to September 6, 1951, when
she was laid off from her employment due to a seasonal slump in the industry.
She had been a pattern maker for 12 years and she had also worked as a general
manager in the dress industry. She filed a claim for benefits in Easton, Pa.,
effective September 10, 1951, against New York State as the liable State and
registered with the Pennsylvania Employment Service. On October 31, 1951
claimant refused a referral to employment as assembler of coils offering $1.09
per hour in a local radio factory. On the premise that claimant restricted her
employability to work as a pattern maker in an area where such work was
non-existent, the Out-of State Resident Office ruled her ineligible for
benefits on the ground that she was unavailable for employment. Claimant moved
from Woodside, N.Y., to Easton, Pa. in 1948 when her husband obtained a
teacher's position in a local college. Her household also consists of her child
and of her mother. Claimant's only employment was in New York City, where she
maintained an apartment jointly with a sister. Since 1948 she customarily
returned to Easton to live with her family on week-ends and during layoff
periods. The seasonal layoffs in claimant's line of work usually occurred in
August or in September of each year and the date of her return to work depended
upon the date of the showing of new spring dresses. She earned $95 for a
five-day week, seven hours a day. When she was laid off from her employment,
claimant went to Easton to be with her family and within two weeks she returned
to New York City for two days for the purpose of securing employment in her
line. She contacted her employer, studied market conditions and made inquiries
for employment with other employers. Claimant again returned to New York City
from October 4 to October 7, 1951 during which time she interviewed her former
production manager and others associated in her line of work. In the early part
of November 1951 claimant made another trip to New York City to contact her
employer and to otherwise seek work. She also maintained constant contact with
a private employment agency with whom she registered. On November 27, 1951
claimant obtained employment through her former production manager a t a wage
of $95 for a five-day week, seven hours a day. On January 28, 1952 claimant
obtained another job through the private employment agency at a wage of $125 a
week. At the time of her hearing on February 5, 1952 claimant, was engaged in
both of those employments .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant had removed herself from her normal labor market she was bound to
accept employment outside of her usual occupation and also that her visits to
New York City to obtain employment were occasional and insufficient to render
her available. We do not agree with these conclusions. This is not a case of a
claimant's leaving her normal labor market. In accordance with her pattern
since changing her residence in 1948 claimant merely returned to her home in
Easton during a slack period in her industry. She continued to maintain the
apartment in New York City which she rented jointly with her sister. During the
two and one-half months period of her unemployment, claimant continued her
attachment to the New York City labor market. She exerted conscientious efforts
to obtain employment in her line by three visits to New York City of several
days' duration, by maintaining constant contact with her former employer and
with a private employment agency and by making numerous inquiries among persons
connected with her line of work for work with other employers. That the methods
used by the claimant to obtain employment was effective is evidenced by the
fact she succeeded in obtaining two jobs through those efforts. Under these
circumstances, we find no basis for the referee's decision and we cannot agree
that it was incumbent on claimant to seek and accept other work in Easton,
where the prevailing rate of wages is stated to be 75 cents an hour, and were
opportunities do not exist for the type of work in which she has had many years
of training and experience. Accordingly, we hold claimant was available for
employment. (<u>Matter of Loeb,</u>&nbsp;269 App. Div. 917.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was employed for 27 years as a mixer
(the last year of his employment as a cleaner) by a nationally known biscuit
baking company. The employer is in contractual relations with a trade union of
its employees. The claimant at all times was and still is a member thereof.
Claimant’s take-home pay was about $60 a week. In accordance with the
employer’s personnel policy and solely because claimant attained the age of 65
on April 12, 1951, his employment was terminated on April 28, 1951, even though
claimant was willing and able to continue to work. Under a formal pension plan
adopted by the employer in 1946, employees are retired effective the first day
of the month following the 65th birthday, but there is no limitation with
respect to the right of a retired employee to obtain employment with other
employers. The plan takes into consideration the amount of Old Age and
Survivors Insurance benefits for which a pensioned worker may qualify. Based on
his number of years of continuous service with the employer and his average earnings
for the last 10 years of his employment, claimant receives a monthly pension of
$29.73. In addition claimant qualified for and receives $63.20 a month as OASI
benefits. Following his involuntary retirement claimant paid one year’s union
dues in advance and holds a retired status union card which qualifies him to
take union employment with any other of the several baking companies in
contractual relations with the union. Retired status card holders are referred
by the union to job openings with other employers when they occur, without
relation to the fact that the member had previously been retired by claimant's
employer. Claimant filed an original claim effective June 4, 1951 and
registered for employment. He continued to report to the local office and the
employment service until the week ending February 10, 1952. Throughout this
reporting period the employment service never referred the claimant to any job
opening, nor was his attention ever directed to any possible source of
employment either by the employment service or the local office. The claimant
is in good health and able to work. He is willing to work either on a day or
night shift without restriction as to salary, but expects to be paid about $1
an hour. On his own initiative claimant actively sought employment without
restriction either as to the kind of work or type of establishment. He
personally applied for work at a number of large baking companies, several
retail bakery stores, two milk companies, a department store, ice cream companies,
a lumber yard, a restaurant and two other establishments offering work, as a
helper, porter, cleaner or at any other job requiring no particular skill other
than the ability to work as a common laborer. Claimant's efforts to obtain
employment were unsuccessful principally because the various employers
solicited would not employ applicants of claimant's age. Claimant does not
fully comprehend the English language. At the hearing before the Board he
required the services of an interpreter. Based on interviews reduced to
writing, the local office held claimant to be ineligible for benefits on the
ground that he was unavailable for employment. Claimant requested a hearing and
this appeal is from the referee's decision sustaining the action taken by the
local office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole issue in this case is whether or not
claimant was available for employment during the period of his reporting for
benefits. Whether one is &quot;available for work&quot; engage in his usual
employment or in any other for which he is reasonably fitted by training and
experience,&quot; within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law (Section
522), depends to a large extent upon the facts and circumstances in each case
(Appeal Board, 8745-43; affirmed in Matter of&nbsp;<u>Maude May Smith</u>, 267
App. Div. 468). Although not susceptible of a precise&nbsp;<u>definition, we
have&nbsp;</u>long held the phrase &quot;available for work&quot; to mean a
claimant 's readiness, willingness and ability to continue to perform ,work for
which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience (Appeal Board,
2065-40; 2717-40; 5540-41). When a claimant's readiness and willingness to
accept work is brought into question by his conduct or other facts indicating
possible unavailability, the presence or absence of efforts to obtain employment,
other than merely registering with the employment service as required,
constitute overt acts indicative of a claimant's state of mind, and is
competent evidence to be judged in determining the probability of claimant's
assertions in the light of the established and admitted facts and other
relative factors and circumstances (Appeal Board, 6759-42). For the foregoing
reasons it becomes important in this type of case to ascertain the
circumstances under which the employee lost his employment. Clearly, if an
employee voluntarily relinquishes a job to accept a pension, such conduct would
be persuasive evidence of his withdrawal from the labor market. In such a case
it might well be said that the employee, by his own conduct, chooses to make
himself unavailable for employment. The claimant in this case however lost his
employment merely because of the passage of time. After 27 years with a single
employer and upon reaching 65 years of age, claimant's employment was
terminated as a result of the employer's unilateral action in fulfillment of
its own personal policy. But for this circumstance, claimant might still have
been employed. Despite his ability to work and his readiness and willingness to
continue to work, the occurrence of an event over which claimant had no control
automatically changed his economic status from a productive worker, earning in
excess of $60 weekly, to a pensioner at $29.73 a month, without restriction
however to his right to accept such employment as he might be able to find with
other employers. The fact that some employers are reluctant to hire elderly,
though physically capable workers, does not in and of itself make them
unavailable for employment (Appeal Board, 9975-43). The test, we have held is
not the available of work for the claimant, but the availability of the
claimant for work (Appeal Board, 12,626-46; 17,200-48; 23,041-50). We are not
unaware of the situation in which an aging worker too often finds himself in
his endeavor to continue an attachment to the labor market. The problem has
come to the attention of the public with recurrent frequency in the literature
on the subject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

plight of the aging and the aged in our population, particularly with reference
to their lack of employment opportunities, has for some time engaged the
sensitive awareness of both State and Federal legislators. The Social Security
legislation of the 1930’s was the earliest attempt on the part of the Congress
to deal with this problem. It has as its principal purposes assisting workers
to maintain themselves without a dole in periods of unemployment and
encouraging aged workers to leave the labor market by providing them with
retirement benefits. More recently, the philosophy regarding retirement has
changed somewhat. The Congress has recognized that many people of retirement
age wish to continue at work, if only part time. The 1950 amendments to the
Social Security Act raise from $14 to $50 the amount which OASI beneficiaries
may earn monthly without reducing their pensions. They remove all limitation
upon earnings of beneficiaries 75 or over. (Legislation and the Older Workers

not an aged worker was available for employment as presented to the Indiana
Courts. In that case, as in the one before us, an aged claimant was initially
denied benefits on the basis of his lack of effort to find work. In overruling
the disqualification, what the appellate Court of Indiana said in&nbsp;<u>Nelson
v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security Division</u>, (82 N.E. (2d) 523;
13371-Ind. Ct. D.; Ben. Ser., Vol. 12, No. 5) is opposite to the case at bar:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

court judicially knows that job opportunities are limited to individuals 70
years of age and over, and the record does not disclose a complete lack of
effort to seek work on the part of the claimant or a refusal to accept any type
of employment on the part of the claimant. It seems clearly apparent from a
consideration of the circumstances that the failure of the claimant to make a
further independent search for work was not the proximate cause of his
continued unemployment. The fact that claimant had quit a job before because it
constituted janitor work and for which he was penalized under the Act, cannot
be held as a continuing basis for a denial of unemployment compensation
benefits where the same individual makes claim for a later period, and presents
himself without restrictions or conditions to a division of State government
created by the Indiana Legislature with adequate trained personnel in
continuous contact with the labor market to find available work for him. The
claimant also made some slight effort to look for work, and there are no facts
and circumstances from which it could be inferred that claimant subsequent to
the renewal of his claim had refused any employment offered him. It seems
significant that the record shows that the Employment Security Division offered
not a single job to claimant. The availability test must be applied with a full
consideration of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. There must
be some basis for an inference that with some effort on behalf of claimant he
could reasonably be expected to find work for himself. Such basis does not
exist in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the case before us, that claimant’s unemployment is the result of industry’s
attitude toward workers in his age class. Because of this involuntary
unemployment, claimant seeks benefits. This is the very type of unemployment
intended to be insured under the law. We have found that claimant did in fact
exert efforts, though fruitless, to find employment. In addition he was
registered with the employment service which has access to many more sources of
employment than any individual claimant could possibly have. During claimant’s
entire period of reporting for benefits at the insurance office and at the
employment service, it is significant that not a single referral to a possible
job opening was given to the claimant. Nor did either of these offices ever
give claimant any other lead which might have resulted in possible employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then can it be said that this claimant rendered herself unavailable for

eligibility for benefits found in the Statute and in the implementing
regulations of the Commissioner. It is reasonable to believe that the
Legislature, in providing for inter-related functions between the benefit
claims-taking section and the employment service, intended that the Commissioner
should expose claimants to the large reservoir of employment opportunities
afforded by the latter service. This claimant did expose herself to this source
of employment, but without success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of claimant’s course of conduct both prior to and subsequent to the termination
of his employment, we are extremely reluctant to infer, as suggested, that
claimant was unwilling to relinquish his OASI benefits in order to be gainfully
re-employed at a salary, which if judged by his most recent earning capacity,
would of necessity be far in excess of his OASI benefits (Appeal Board,
7764-42). Under all of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that no

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, an unskilled worker, is classified
as a packer. He does not belong to any trade union. Between June 1950 and March
1951, he worked for a large grocery chain as a bread packer. This employment
was terminated because of excessive absences. Thereafter, as a result of a
referral by the employment service, claimant was next employed as a stockroom
helper for about two and one-half weeks ending August 24, 1951. Claimant
refiled for benefits effective September 10, 1951. On October 4, 1951 claimant
accepted a referral to a wholesale winery, as a laborer. No experience was required.
The job duties were to pack bottles into cartons and assist in labeling,
filling and capping. The details set forth on the job order were discussed with
the claimant. Among other things, he was told that the job would last
approximately from two or three months and that the employer’s establishment
was operated as a union shop. Admittedly, claimant was advised that he would be
required to make arrangements with the union, then in contractual relations
with the employer, to obtain a temporary work card, and that he might be
required to pay either union dues or a work card fee. Subject to claimant’s
procuring a temporary work card from the union, he was hired by the employer to
commence working on October 8, 1951. Following his interview with the employer,
claimant promptly visited the union office and obtain the required work card
which permitted him to commence working, as a temporary employee, in the
employer’s establishment for the period ending December 31, 1951. The union
informed the claimant that in lieu of dues he was required to pay $10 in weekly
installments, while working, in fulfillment of the union’s requirement for the
issued work card. Although claimant accepted the temporary card he failed to
report to work on October 8 as directed by the employer. As a result, claimant
was disqualified from receiving benefits effective October 4, 1951. Between
August 24 and December 7, 1951, claimant continued to remain unemployed. At the
time of claimant’s referral, eight other applicants for employment likewise
were referred to the same establishment. Each of these persons, upon being
hired, accepted employment with the employer. The industry to which claimant
was referred is highly unionized. Union shops unable to obtain services of
union members temporarily employ non-union workers, who are required to obtain
permit or work cards from the union in contractual relations with the
establishments. The customary practice for new employees is either to pay the
equivalent union dues then being paid by regular union members or in lieu
thereof, a lump sum for a work card permitting non-union employees to work in
union shops. Customarily, the single payment instead of union dues is
liquidated in small, weekly installments out of each week’s earnings until fully
paid. The claimant contested the initial determination made by the local
office. The referee sustained the action of the local office and claimant
appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

offered employment, as set forth in his request for a hearing, is based on his
unwillingness to &quot;pay $10 to the union for a temporary job.&quot; He
further stated: &quot;If I were offered a permanent job I would gladly pay the
money to the union.&quot; Consequently, the only question presented by this
appeal is whether the imposition of the employer’s condition, that claimant
procure a temporary union card, will support claimant’s refusal to accept the
offered work. Thus, within the framework of our Statute, we must determine
whether or not the refusal was with good cause, within the meaning of Section
593.2 of the Law which, insofar as it is pertinent to the issue, provides as

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>This provision in the
statute is designed to prevent the use of the Unemployment Insurance Law to
interfere with a claimant’s freedom of union affiliation or non-affiliation,
except that the statutory clause imposes no barrier to a requirement that a
claimant join a union, unless the organization which he is asked to join is a
&quot;company union.&quot; This Board has consistently sustained the
disqualification of claimants for either refusing to accept employment, or for
voluntarily leaving employment that necessitated their joining or retaining
membership in a bona fide union under a preferential or closed shop arrangement
(Appeal Board, 26,009-50; 12,854-476 13,815-46). Nor does an unwillingness to
pay usual and reasonable union dues and initiation fees constitute good cause
for either a refusal of employment or for a voluntary leaving of employment
(Appeal Board, 16,783-48; 24,591-50; 11,875-45; 24,718-50). The mere fact that
the employment offered to claimant was temporary would not justify his refusal
to accept the employment (Appeal Board 5423-41; 5779-41). Does, then, the
requirement that claimant pay $10 for a union work card bring his refusal of
the work, with the resultant continuance of his unemployment, within the
statutory meaning of the term &quot;good cause,&quot; so as to protect him from
the disqualification provision of the section? We believe it does not. The
principal objective of the statute is to alleviate economic distress caused by
involuntary unemployment. In addition to the four particular sets of
circumstances explicitly set forth in the statute, under each of which a
refusal cannot be deemed to be without good cause, sound policy requires that a
claimant who refuses employment may nevertheless remain eligible for benefits
only where there is some necessitous and compelling reason for the refusal of
offered work (Appeal Board, 9576-43). The term &quot;good cause&quot; is not
defined by the statute. As a concept, it must, be necessity, remain flexible
and without rigid definition. Causes to be deemed good, must be substantial
causes, founded in real circumstances, that will bear the test of reason. In
short, a decision to refuse to take a job must be based upon real, substantial
and reasonable circumstances, so that a reasonable man of ordinary prudence
would be motivated or impelled to refuse the offered employment. We must regard
without merit claimant’s unwillingness to pay the union $10, in small, weekly
installments during a period of two and possibly three months of employment,
when considered with his statement: &quot;I would gladly pay the money to the
union&quot; if offered a permanent job. The claimant knew that the shop to
which he was referred was under union regulations. It was therefore to be
expected that certain requirements would have to be met by him (Appeal Board,
1828-39). Viewed in the light of the weekly salary of $52 offered claimant for
a five-day, 40 hour week, it appears to us that the $10 union fee for a work
card was a reasonable requirement, especially since it was payable in a number
of small weekly installment payments during the period of his temporary
employment. In this respect, no hardship would have been worked upon the
claimant. The effect of the union terms and conditions superimposed on the work
refused by the claimant, did not differ in its effect upon him from their
effect on the eight other claimants who accepted the employment, and the many
others employed in the industry which is highly unionized. Thus, it cannot be
said that the condition, urged by the claimant as objectionable to him in
justification for his refusal, was substantially less favorable to him than the
condition generally prevailing for the workers in the industry. We regard the
claimant’s election to remain idle, when he might have been working, as not
being based on either real, substantial or reasonable grounds. Necessarily, it
reflects upon the good faith of his refusal. In our opinion, claimant’s refusal
of the offered employment was without good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shop manufacturing ladies’ garments. He was laid off on March 18, 1951 because
of lack of work. Claimant filed an additional claim for benefits on September
3, 1951. During claimant’s period of unemployment, he visited the employer’s
shop on many occasions when there were men at work in the shop, including
finishers, which was claimant’s trade. Claimant’s shop was in contractual
relations with the union in which he was a member and under the terms of the
union contract the employees in the shop had the right to share in the work. He
could have demanded that he be given a share of the work, but he did not
request it of the employer, nor did he request his union to enforce his right
to share the work that was available. Based on interviews had with the claimant
and a report received from the employer, the local office issued an initial
determination holding claimant ineligible for benefits effective October 8,
1951, on the ground that he was unavailable for employment. Claimant contested
the initial determination and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the
initial determination and the Industrial Commissioner appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

when he visited the shop on numerous occasions saw men at work including those

representative and insisted upon his rights. This he failed to do. Under the
circumstances, we conclude that the local office properly hold him ineligible
for benefits effective October 8, 1951, on the ground that he was unavailable

and a half years ending July 1951 as a pantry girl in a restaurant in Buffalo
with earnings of $30 a week. She was laid off from this employment. She
previously worked from 1946 to 1949 as a liner of jewelry boxes. Claimant filed
a claim for benefits on July 30, 1951, registered for employment and reported
to March 4, 1952. She was given the occupational classifications of liner of
jewelry boxes and pantry girl. On November 20, 1951, claimant was referred to a
job as a pantry girl in a restaurant in Buffalo with hours from 3 p.m. to 11
p.m. at $30 for a six-day week. The employer furnished meals and uniforms.
Claimant refused the referral because she did not want to work nights. She was
willing to work until 7 p.m. and would have accepted the job offer on a day
shift. According to claimant’s statement at the local office she intended to
marry in March 1952 when her fiancé would enter military service and she wanted
to be with him as much as possible. On November 20, 1951 claimant was referred
to another job in a jewelry factory paying 80 cents an hour, but was not hired
due to lack of experience. The local office issued an initial determination
holding that claimant without good cause refused employment as a pantry girl on
November 20, 1951.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would interfere with her social life. Her refusal to accept the offer was based

1951 as a rubber for a manufacturer of case goods in Jamestown earning $90 a
week. The employer was in contractual relations with claimant’s union. Because
he sustained an injury on the job for which an award in workmen’s compensation
benefits was made he could not continue his line of work. When he returned to
the establishment for re-employment on October 8, 1951, after his recovery, he
requested the employer to transfer him to lighter work, to which transfer he
was entitled under the terms of the agreement between the employer and
claimant’s union. The employer refused to re-hire claimant and he became
unemployed as a result thereof. Claimant invoked the arbitration machinery for
reinstatement pursuant to the union agreement and his grievance was submitted
to an arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award set forth that the termination of the
employment was not of claimant’s volition, that claimant should be reinstated
with all rights unimpaired not later than December 17, 1951, and that the
employer was directed to pay claimant the sum of $100, &quot;&quot;in lieu of
any time lost as a result of his separation from employment during the period
from October 8, 1951 to December 17, 1951.&quot; This award was not treated as
wages in the employer's payroll records or in its reports to the taxing
agencies. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective October 15, 1951. By
initial determination of the local office dated November 8, 1951 claimant was
ruled ineligible for benefits effective October 15, 1951 on the ground that he
was unavailable. An additional determination was issued by the local office
under date of January 11, 1952 ruling claimant ineligible for benefits from
October 8, 1951 to December 17, 1951 on the ground that he was not considered
to be totally unemployed during that period because of the aforementioned award
of $100 to him. Claimant contested these determinations and requested a hearing
thereon. The referee sustained the determination as to lack of total
unemployment from which decision the claimant appealed to this Board. The
referee held that in view of his decision as to lack of total unemployment the
issue as to unavailability was academic. Claimant returned to employment with
his former employer on December 17,1951.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee ruled that claimant was not
totally unemployed from October 8, 1951 to December 17, 1951 on the ground he
had received an award of back pay for this period. Claimant earned a wage of
about $90 a week and his loss of earnings in the ten-week period involved
amounted to about $900. It is inconceivable that the arbitrator’s award of $100
was intended to represent reimbursement to claimant for wages lost as a result
of the employer’s violation of claimant’s right to employment under the
bargaining agreement. It is clear that the employer did not consider the award
as back pay since it did not treat it as wages in its books of account. Since
the award bears no reasonable relationship to and did not compensate claimant
for loss of wages suffered by him during the ten-week period there is no basis
for the initial determination that claimant received &quot;back pay&quot;
covering the entire period and was therefore not totally unemployed. The most
that a can be said is that claimant received the equivalent of the amount of
wages he would have earned in one week and one day. We so hold. However, since
claimant filed his claim for benefits on October 15, 1951, after having been
denied reinstatement on October 8, 1951, the week for which he received
reimbursement did not fall within the filing period. We are concerned,
therefore, only with the period on and after October 15, 1951. As to such
period the claimant received the equivalent of back pay for only one day, and
consequently may be considered as being not totally unemployed as of that day,
namely, October 15, 1951. There is no evidence in the record to support the
initial determination that claimant was unavailable for employment pending the
outcome of the proceedings looking for reinstatement in his job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

capacity for about three years to February 2, 1951. On January 25, 1951, upon
passing his physical examination for entrance into the Armed Forces, he was
advised by his draft board that he would probably be inducted sometime during
the month of March. Claimant resigned from his position on February 2 because
he &quot;wanted to take it easy&quot; until he entered Service. Due to a
reduction of the quotas, claimant had not been inducted as of the date of the
hearing before the referee on May 9, 1951. Claimant filed a claim for benefits
effective March 26, 1951. Claimant unsuccessfully sought reinstatement with his
former employer. He made token efforts to obtain employment in his
neighborhood. He restricted himself to a job within a &quot;short traveling
distance.&quot; Based on an interview, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits, effective March
26, 1951, and for a period of 42 consecutive days following his certification
to a bona fide return to the labor market, upon the ground he voluntarily left
his employment without good cause and withdrew from the labor market. The
claimant requested a hearing and the referee overruled the initial
determination. The Industrial Commissioner thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee held that claimant was justified
in leaving his employment because of the imminence of his entry into the Armed
Forces. The referee further held that claimant had no withdrawn from the labor
market. We are not in accord with the referee. There is nothing in the record
to indicate that claimant’s induction was &quot;imminent.&quot; He was advised
by his draft board that his induction would be at least a month after the time
he resigned on February 2. We cannot recognize claimant’s desire &quot;to take
it easy&quot; for a period of at least one month before induction as good cause
for leaving employment, within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law.
Under the circumstances of this case, when claimant voluntarily resigned from this
position he must be deemed to have left the labor market. Cogent and convincing
evidence of his re-entry into the labor market is required. While it is true
claimant sought reinstatement with his former employer, the remainder of his
efforts to obtain employment, slight and sporadic at best, were limited to his
immediate neighborhood. In our opinion claimant has not demonstrated a bona
fide return to the labor market within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last employed by the same firm for about 26 years to January 5, 1950. He was
laid off due to a re-organization. He filed a claim for benefits on March 14,
1950. In response to a newspaper advertisement, claimant applied for a job as a
real estate salesman and was hired commencing March 24, 1950. He procured a
real estate salesman license. He worked six day a week from 10 a.m. to about 6
p.m. He also worked two nights a week. There was no written contract of hire,
but it was agreed that he would work on a commission basis and pay his own
expenses. His duties were to sell real estate. Leads were furnished by the
employer. He worked for this employer until May 24, 1950. He earned $644.21 in
commissions during this period, but received no money until June 9, 1950 at
which time he received his first payment. He was commended by this employer for
his diligent work. Upon severing his relations with his first employer in May,
claimant without lapse of time, was immediately employed by another real estate
firm on a commission basis. His duties, days and hours of employment, were
substantially the same as at his previous position. He was so employed at the
time of the hearing before the referee. Claimant did not disclose to the local
office his association with these real estate firms until June 30, 1950, his
first reporting date, after he received his first check for commissions earned
with the first employer. He did not consider himself employed until after he
received his first commission payment. During the period of claimant’s
association with the two real estate firms, he sought employment with two milk
concerns. Based on an interview, the local office issued an initial
determination holding claimant ineligible for benefits, effective March 24,
1950, for lack of total unemployment and overpaid in the sum of $312 in
benefits. This initial determination was dated July 6, 1950. On July 10, 1950,
claimant protested this initial determination to an employee of the Division of
Placement and Unemployment Insurance at the local office. He did not execute a
formal request for a hearing until November 17, 1950. At the hearing before the
referee, the Industrial Commissioner pressed the issue of timeliness. The
referee held that the request for a hearing was made within the statutory time
limit and overruled the initial determination of the local office which held
claimant ineligible for benefits, effective March 24, 1950, for lack of total
unemployment and that he was overpaid the sum of $312 in benefits. The
Industrial Commissioner thereupon appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that a claimant’s request for a hearing be made in writing or that even a
formal request therefore is made. It is sufficient if claimant makes a protest
or indicates a dissatisfaction with the initial determination in a manner so
that a request for a hearing can be inferred or spelled out from his words or
actions. This claimant’s protest of the initial determination made to an
employee at the local office should be considered as a request for a hearing
(Appeal Board, 7,585-42). In any event, claimant should be given the benefit of
the doubt and afforded an opportunity of a hearing of a hearing on the merits
(Appeal Board, 12,047-45). The referee cites a series of cases to support his
decision that the claimant herein was totally unemployed during the period in
question. Each and every case cited by the referee is clearly distinguishable
from the instant case. In Appeal Board, 13,127-46, claimant, a real estate
salesman, did not have fixed hours of employment, was not required to comply
with rules binding on other salesmen made only periodic visits to the office to
look for lists, and exerted only sporadic efforts to solicit business and
consummate sales. He did not make any sales or earn any commissions during this
period, and diligently sought employment for which he was qualified. In Appeal
Board, 14,552-47, claimant, during the period in question, was associated with
a real estate firm in order to learn the business. He worked on a commission
basis. He had no fixed hours of employment and was not subject to any rules or
course of conduct prescribed by the firm. He devoted but a few hours a day to
observe the operation of the business and exerted little or no effort to make
sales. He made diligent efforts to seek employment elsewhere. In appeal Board,
15,441-47, claimant was employed by a real estate firm. He worked on a
commission basis. He was not required to devote a specific amount of time to
his work. His duties consisted of listing property for sale, obtaining
descriptions and approvals. He obtained leads through the medium of
advertisements in newspapers. He did not sell real estate. He received
commissions only when property listed by him was sold. He did not earn any
commission during his reporting period. He diligently sought work as an
accountant for which he was qualified. In appeal Board, 17,714-48, claimant
signed a contract with a scale distributor to act as its sole representative
within a designated territory. He was to act as a dealer not as an employee. He
was to receive a commission and pay his own expenses. During the period in issue,
he was undergoing a training period. He received instruction in the operation
of scales and salesmanship. He paid his own expenses and received no
commissions during the period. He devoted only such time to the work as he saw
fit. During the period, he regularly reported to the employment office and
sought employment. An analysis of the above cases cited by the referee reveals
a basic factual difference which distinguishes them from the case at bar. In
none of the cases cited was claimant required to work or make an effort to
obtain business with some degree of regularity. Their activity was a side-line
effort. Whatever efforts they exerted to obtain business was in the nature of
stop-gap activity during their free time while they devoted themselves assiduously
to obtaining permanent employment in a field in which they were qualified by
training experience. In the cases above cited, the employer-employee
relationship did not exist. The claimant herein had regular hours, worked
diligently at his job and earned commissions. This work required his full time
and continuous attention. He appears to have fashioned a new career for
himself, namely, that of real estate salesman (Appeal Board, 365-38). The
claimant did not report his employment to the local office because of his
misapprehension of the law with respect to commissions. He felt that he was not
employed because he had not actually been paid during the period in question.
The commission which a salesman receives results from continued solicitation
and cannot be allocated to the efforts expended on the day on which the sale is
finally consummated or the commission paid (Appeal Board,289-38). The
commission earned by the claimant is referable to his entire period of
employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

musician in that he plays only with symphonic orchestras. For approximately 25
years he has been a member of an orchestra furnishing the music at the
Metropolitan Opera House. Claimant has developed a reputation in his field
which has caused him to be generally known among the members of groups which
ordinarily engage symphonic orchestras. In periods when there was no employment
for the claimant at the Metropolitan Opera House he would occasionally obtain
employment making recordings with other members of the orchestra. In all
instances claimant's employment is obtained through the services of a person
known as a contractor who maintains headquarters in New York City and to whom
persons who hire symphonic orchestras apply for the services of claimant and
other specialty musicians. In the period here at issue operations were
suspended at the Metropolitan Opera House with the result that claimant was
temporarily laid off. Claimant maintained a summer home at Bearsville for
approximately ten years. After operations were suspended at the Metropolitan
Opera House claimant established temporary residence at his summer home.
However, prior to the filing of the claim in issue and after the suspension of
operations at the Metropolitan Opera House, claimant learned of an opportunity
for employment in connection with the making of records, and he accordingly
left Bearsville to accept the employment in New York City. The contractor was
aware of claimant's telephone number at Bearsville, and it was understood that
claimant was ready, willing, and able to return to New York City or to proceed
to any area at which an opportunity for employment existed, and that he would
leave Bearsville for that purpose immediately upon receipt of a telephone call.
After the completion of his work in connection with the making of the
recordings, claimant returned to his home at Bearsville. Throughout the summer
claimant maintained contact with the contractor and with the conditions
affecting specialty musicians generally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was due to resume his employment at the Metropolitan Opera House, he received a
telephone call from the contractor indicating that there was a vacancy in the

accepted the employment, leaving Bearsville for New York City on the date on
which he received the telephone call. He remained employed with the orchestra
at the City Center until he resumed work at the Metropolitan Opera House. In
the two cases, the records of which have been incorporated herein by reference,
other members of the orchestra who resided temporarily at Bearsville had made
similar claims for benefits and had been ruled ineligible because of

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The credible evidence
indicates that claimant's unemployment was due entirely to circumstances over
which he had no control. His temporary residence away from the City of New York
was not for the purpose of sojourning in order to enjoy a vacation, but on the
contrary, claimant was at all times prepared to return to New York City or to
any area if his type of work could have been procured. The fact that claimant
was away from New York City in no way interfered with his opportunities of
procuring work because contact was maintained with those sources from which
claimant could reasonably be expected to learn of employment opportunities in
his field of endeavor. Under these circumstances, it may not be said that
claimant rendered himself unavailable for employment within the contemplation
of the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law (Appeal Board 24791-50 and
26342-51). The initial determination is overruled. (March 17, 1952 )<o:p></o:p></span></p>

capacity by a fur manufacturer. Claimant was a member of a union which called a
strike against the members of an association of furriers of which her employer
was a member. The strike was called on June 25 and was terminated on July 13.
Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective June 25, 1951. Claimant was a
skip-week worker. She worked Friday, June 22 and normally, would have returned
to work on Monday, July 2. Based on an interview, the local office issued an
initial determination suspending claimant’s benefit rights for the period June
25 through August 12, 1951, upon the ground she lost her employment due to an
industrial controversy in the establishment in which she was employed and
holding her overpaid the sum of $25 in benefits. Claimant requested a hearing
at which the initial determination was amended to make the effective date of
the suspension June 26 through July 13. The referee sustained, but modified the
amended initial determination by changing the effective date of the suspension
to July 3 through July 13 and ruled claimant was not overpaid. The Industrial
Commissioner appeals to this Board from so much of the referee’s decision as
changes the effective date of the suspension and holds claimant was not
overpaid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

legislature intended that all claimants involved in a strike or other

measured from the day following the strike or industrial controversy. The error
in departing from this principal is, we think, illustrated in the referee’s
distinction between those on sick leave when the strike commenced and those who
took sick immediately thereafter. Although both categories obviously merit the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was had at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant, a porter, filed a claim
effective April 28, 1952. By initial determination effective the same date, he
was disqualified for 42 days for voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause. Claimant was employed at a club operated by a fraternal organization
from August 7, 1951 to April 25, 1952, at 90 cents per hour, as a porter. He
voluntarily left his employment on the latter date because the building
superintendent was constantly criticizing his work and used vile and obscene
language in addressing him. He indicated that he was unable to perform the work
to the satisfaction of the superintendent who constantly nagged him regarding
his work. The employer notified the insurance office that claimant had quit:
&quot;Work not satisfactory and we are just as pleased that he did quit of his
own accord.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: It is clear that the
superintendent was dissatisfied with claimant’s services and, apparently, was
desirous of terminating his services. Claimant quit his job because he felt
that he could no longer endure the criticism and nagging of the superintendent.
In&nbsp;<u>Consiglio v. Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act</u>, 137
Conn. 693, 696 (Conn. Sup. Ct., VL-500.752-7, BSSUI.) The Court in part said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;Is an employee
justified in quitting his job because of nagging? That, it seems, would depend
upon the extent and nature of the nagging. Goldberg testified, ‘I just couldn’t
stand it anymore. I was afraid I was going to get very sick and I just couldn’t
stand it.’ It is found by the Commissioner that ‘For a period of four or five
months prior to February 20, 1951, the senior partner was finding fault with
the claimant’s work but the claimant knew that most of the fault finding was
meaningless.’ This latter statement is based, apparently, on what the son
testified. Nagging may be meaningless to the fellow doing it but not
necessarily to the fellow on the receiving end. It is evident that Goldberg was
much concerned about the constant fault finding for the last four or five
months of his employment. Did he act as a reasonable person would have acted in
the light of all the circumstances in quitting his job?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;There is a
difference between legitimate criticism and nagging. Criticism may be
justified; it can finally, if kept up long enough, degenerate into a constant
nagging. There is a limit to what a man is obliged to take in order to hold his
job. It is evident that there was nagging. The claim is that he was supposed to
take it, everybody did; that it was meaningless. We must use common sense in
deciding this matter of extent to which the employees must take it. He can be
flighty or he can be patient till finally the situation becomes unbearable. No
employee should have to take constant nagging. In this case it was clearly not
a quick temper or impulsive decision which made the employee quit. No sensible
man is giving up a $135 a week job merely because he is sore or angry. An
employer can be so mean as to drive an employee off the job. The claim that you
are supposed to take it is not a sufficient answer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

together on one roll of duck cloth, had inspected only one side. An immediate
hearing was held at which they were represented by their union and at the conclusion
thereof they were discharged. Claimants inquired of their union representative
and their superiors as to whether they should file for unemployment insurance
benefits and were told that they should. When they applied, each claimant wrote
on her application form that the reason she left or lost their job was because
of &quot;no work.&quot; It is because of those statements that claimants are

maliciously or intentionally mislead the local office for the purpose of
obtaining benefits. We are not in accord with his conclusion. Claimants knew
that there was work to be had in the establishment of their last employer. The
only reason why they were unable to obtain such work and the reason why they
were not actually employed at the time they filed their claim for benefits, was
because of their discharge from such employment as the result of their own
wrongful actions. Claimants knew that their unemployment was due to their
discharge. They also knew that work was being performed in the establishment of
their last employer at the time of their discharge. Consequently, when they
informed the local office that they were unemployed because of &quot;no
work&quot;, they were wilfully making a misrepresentation of the true reason
for their unemployment. They knew that the cause to which they were ascribing
their unemployment as not the true one. We do not agree with the referee that
the case of&nbsp;<u>Matter of Dora Trepper</u>, 278 App. Div. 993, reversing
Appeal Board, 23,204-50 is distinguishable from this case. We believe, however,
that the decision of the Court of Appeals in&nbsp;<u>Matter of Max Bernstein</u>,
303 N.Y. 755, affirming 278 app. Div. 625, which reversed Appeal Board,
22,265-50 is determinative of the issue in this case. Under the ruling therein,
it must be held that these claimants were guilty of wilfully making false
representations for the purpose of obtaining benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, a salesman, filed effective February 11, 1952. By revised
initial determination he was disqualified effective April 7 for refusal of
employment without good cause. On April 7 claimant refused an offer of
employment as an insurance salesperson solely because he objected to the
condition imposed by the employer to the effect that it would be necessary for
claimant immediately upon the acceptance of employment to join a union.
Claimant had indicated that he had no objection to becoming a member of the
union but he insisted that he was privileged to work for 30 days before being
compelled to join the union. He maintained that the condition imposed by the
employer was in conflict with the provisions of the&nbsp;<u>Taft-Hartley Act</u>,
and that so long as the employer insisted upon the fulfillment of such
condition, he would not accept the employment. The employer has corroborated
the contention of claimant to the effect that it was made clear to claimant in
the negotiations between him and the employer’s representative that it would be
necessary for him to join the union immediately upon acceptance of the
employment. At the hearing, in order to sustain his contention that he did not
without good cause refuse employment, claimant submitted a copy of the&nbsp;<u>Taft-Hartley
Law</u>&nbsp;and the record of the Congressional hearings leading up to the
enactment of the Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>Referee’s Opinion and
Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: To support the initial
determination, the Commissioner’s representatives contend that the provisions
of the Taft-Hartley Law are entirely immaterial and urge that notwithstanding
the fact that a condition imposed by the employer might constitute an unfair
labor practice as defined by said Law, claimant could not remain within the
benefit provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law after having refused
employment solely on that ground. The insurance business in which the employer
is engaged, and in which claimant would have been engaged and he accepted the
employment, is within the purview of the provisions of the&nbsp;<u>Taft-Hartley
Law</u>. (<u>Polish National Alliance v N.L.R.B.</u>, 322 U.S. 643.) There is
no provision in the Unemployment Insurance Law which specifically furnishes
good cause to a job applicant for the refusal of employment where the condition
of the hiring would constitute an unfair labor practice under the provisions of
the&nbsp;<u>Taft-Hartley Law</u>. However, the Unemployment Insurance Law is
not specific in enumerating all of the circumstances which furnish good cause
for the refusal of employment. Recently the Appellate Division pointed out
that, &quot;The statute sets forth a list of reasons for ‘refusal to accept
employment’ which are not to be regarded as a refusal not for good cause, but
the list is not exclusive by its very terms but merely fixes certain negative
criteria. The appellant argues for the exclusiveness of the enumeration but the
statute does not read that way. There may be other reasons for refusal
recognizable as well-grounded, and for good cause by the Commissioner or the
Board.&quot; (<u>Matter of Crowe</u>, 280 App. Div. 427 reversing Appeal Board
28,204-51, A-750-1101.) Thus, it is apparent that good cause for the refusal of
employment is to be fond, if it is based on reasons which would motivate an
ordinarily reasonable and prudent person under similar circumstances in
refusing the employment. It would be an anomaly to hold that it is unreasonable
for a person to refuse to accept as a condition for employment the very
condition which the Congress of the United States found that the right of a
worker to engage in employment for a 30-day period without being compelled
during that period to join a union, is a valuable right. Therefore, it can
hardly be said that if a worker insists upon availing himself of that right, he
thereby places himself outside of the benefit provisions of the Unemployment
Insurance Law. (See Case 524-842-50R – no appeal taken.) I therefore hold that
on the facts here adduced, claimant did not, without good cause, refuse
employment. The revised initial determination is overruled. (September 9, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1948 he purchased a derrick-boat which he valued at approximately $75,000.
Since that time claimant had entered into an arrangement with a Mr. P. whereby
claimant was paid a certain amount for the rental of the boat and an additional
sum for his services of the boat. This arrangement was terminated in March
1952, when Mr. P. no longer had any work. Claimant has conducted an intensive
advertising campaign advising the public that the derrick-boat is for hire. He
also has submitted various bids for the rental of this derrick-boat. Claimant
filed a claim for benefits effective March 10, 1952. Based on an interview had
with the claimant, the local office issued an initial and alternative initial
determination holding that claimant, effective March 10,1952, is not totally
unemployed and was unavailable for employment and therefore ineligible for
benefits. Claimant contested the determinations and requested a hearing. The
referee overruled the initial and the alternative initial determinations and
the Industrial Commissioner appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

investment in a derrick-boat valued at a substantial sum of money. He has
conducted an intensive campaign to hire this boat out to the public at a fixed
rental and in additional has submitted bids for the use of his boat. When he
rents his boat, he goes on the payroll of the contractor to whom the boat is
rented. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the claimant was not
available for employment during the period in issue since he was primarily
interested in renting his derrick-boat. In view of our opinion with respect to
claimant’s unavailability, it is not necessary to decide the issue with respect
to claimant’s total unemployment. The alternative initial determination of the
local office holding claimant ineligible for benefits effective March 10, 1952,
on the ground that he was unavailable for employment, is sustained. The
decision of the referee is reversed. (October 10, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Claimant refused to commence work as requested, stating that she did not have

Claimant is an experienced sewing machine operator with a good work record over
a period of several years. She lost her previous employment because of illness
and drew unemployment insurance benefits for a time before the present incident
arose. Claimant was referred to the employment here involved. Claimant promptly
applied for the job, calling on the prospective employment at about 10:00
o’clock in the forenoon. She was accepted for the job and offered to report for
work the following morning. The employer insisted that she start work immediately
or not at all. Claimant did not have work clothes or her special tools with
her. Obviously she could not have known in advance that she would be accepted
and did not report prepared for work or expecting to go to work at that hour of
the day. As far as the record discloses her offer to report the following
morning was made in good faith. Under these circumstances the demand of the
employer was unreasonable. Upon the undisputed facts we think that as a matter
of law the claimant did not refuse employment at all irrespective of
&quot;without good cause&quot;. Decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board reversed, on the law, and the decision of the referee reinstated, with

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant, a sewing-machine operator, refiled
for benefits, effective March 17, 1952. Claimant was experienced in work on
ladies’ suit skirts. In her last employment she made $80 a week at piecework.
She was a member of the union in that industry. The industry is largely
unionized. On April 29, 1952 the employment office referred claimant to
employment as an operator on skirts in a union shop. The pay indicated on the
job order was 35 cents per skirt. On that day claimant had an interview with
the employer who offered her 20 cents for cotton summer skirts being worked on
that morning. The employer told claimant that in that afternoon he planned to
start work on garments at the 35 cents rate. The employer asked claimant to
report for work the next morning. She failed to do so because she considered
the employer’s rates too low. The employer made different types of garments,
with the rate ranging all the way to $1 a skirt. Piecework rates were fixed by
agreement between the employer and claimant’s union, and those of the employer
conformed thereto. There was a bonus of 39 percent on the cotton skirts, and 22
percent on the suit skirts. The operators at the employer’s place earned
between $12 and $15 a day, depending on their speed. Based on the foregoing the
local office issued a determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits, effective April 30, 1952, on the ground that, without good cause, she
refused an offer of employment for which she is reasonably fitted by training
and experience. Claimant contested the determination and requested a hearing
before a referee. The referee overruled the determination from which decision
the Industrial Commissioner appeals to this Board. The last day claimant worked
was March 14, 1952. At the time of the hearing, on June 12, 1952, she was still
unemployed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

salesperson, was last employed by an upholstery fabric concern. Her duties were
evenly divided between showroom selling and ledger posting with some typing.
Claimant can type and generally perform the duties of assistant bookkeeper.
Prior to this employment claimant had performed office work, combined with
incidental showroom selling. Claimant lost her last employment by reason of lack
of work. She filed for benefits effective December 31, 1951 and registered for
employment. She was interviewed at the employment office on February 20, 1952
and described herself as a &quot;stylist&quot;. When questioned at this
interview she denied having any employment in which she did office work.
Positions for assistant bookkeepers at this time were plentiful as compared to
those for showroom sales people, which latter claimant preferred, by reason of
the fact that higher salaries prevailing in the latter type of work. Between
the time of filing and the interview at the employment office, claimant became
pregnant, although she did not become aware of that fact until examination by
her physician on Mach 25, 1952. Subsequent to learning of her pregnancy, claimant
abandoned the idea of obtaining work as a showroom salesperson and made active
efforts to obtain employment as an office worker, but was rejected at several
places were she applied because of her condition. Her doctor certified that she
was capable of working full time. Based on this information the local office
issued an alternative initial determination ruling claimant ineligible for
benefits effective February 20,1952, on the ground that she was unavailable for
employment, was overpaid $210 in benefits, and had made wilfully false
statements to obtain benefits, her benefit rights being declared forfeited for
28 effective days by reason thereof. Claimant contested the determination and
requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial determination insofar as
it held claimant unavailable for employment and the Industrial Commissioner
appeals to this Board. The referee sustained the initial determination insofar
as it held claimant made wilfully false statements to obtain benefits, but
reduced the effective days forfeited from 28 to 24, and the claimant appealed
to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

previous experience as an office worker prevented a proper classification and
consequent referral to jobs which were more readily available to her than the
work to which she restricted herself. This was a self-imposed restriction which
was not in keeping with her previous major skill and experience. We hold that
claimant was unavailable for employment as of February 20,1952, and so
continued until March 25, 1952, when she again demonstrated a genuine
attachment to the labor market by search for employment consonant with her
previous experience. Claimant was overpaid through this period and the benefits
are recoverable, sine she had concealed pertinent facts relating to her claim
for benefits. We find no reason for disturbing the referee’s decision holding
that claimant made wilfully false statements to obtain benefits. By deliberate
denial of having had any experience as an office worker she concealed from the
Industrial Commissioner facts he was entitled to have in order to process
claimant’s application for benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is sustained. The matter is remanded to the local office for re-computation and
re-determination of the overpayment involved, in accordance with the foregoing.
The decision of the referee, insofar as it overrules the initial determination
of the local office holding claimant ineligible for benefits by reason of
unavailability is modified accordingly. The initial determination of the local
office as modified by the referee holding that claimant made a wilfully false

Local 169 of the A. union. Because she was unable to obtain employment within
an employer in contractual relations with her union, claimant, as a result of
her own efforts, obtained employment with the M. company in June 1951. This
employer was in contractual relations with the I. union. Because claimant
refused to join the I. union, her employment was terminated by the employer on
February 15, 1952 at the insistence of that union. Claimant has been a member
of the A. union for more than seven years. By virtue of her membership,
claimant has accumulated certain benefit rights, including among others, the
right to retirement pension and a paid-up life insurance policy upon attaining
20 years of employment and 10 years of union membership immediately preceding
an application for these benefits. The A. union and the I. union are national
labor organizations consisting of a member of subordinate local unions. Local
169 of the A. union and Local 91 of the I. union exercise overlapping
jurisdiction in claimant's trade. The constitutions of both parent unions
prohibit its respective members from simultaneously holding membership in any
other labor organization. In furtherance of this policy, A.'s constitution
provides for a summary suspension from membership, pending formal disciplinary
proceedings leading to expulsion, of any member who is or becomes a member of
any other labor organization. Although A.'s constitution provides that a member
may apply to the executive board of his local union for a withdrawal card, he
must establish to its satisfaction that he is about to leave the country or has
ceased to be employed in any trade or industry within the jurisdiction of the
A. union. If a withdrawal card is issued, the member becomes exempt from the
payment of dues and assessments falling due during the period of his
withdrawal, but he must surrender his membership book and lose all of his
rights and privileges of membership. Such person may be readmitted to
membership without paying an initial fee, provided he makes application for
readmission within one year from the date of his withdrawal, is then eligible
for membership and his application is approved. Any person who applies after
one year from the date of his withdrawal is considered a new applicant for
membership. On February 18, 1952, claimant filed an additional claim for
benefits. By an initial determination effective the same date, the local office
disqualified claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days, on the
ground that she voluntarily left her employment without good cause. The
claimant requested a hearing. The Industrial Commissioner's appeal is from the
referee's decision overruling the initial determination of the local office. In
the interim, shortly before March 26, 1952, claimant obtained employment in an
establishment in contractual relations with the A. union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

position which required her to either join the I. union, leave her employment
or be discharged. Whether claimant's employment was terminated by a voluntary
leaving or resulted from a discharge therefrom, because of an unwillingness to
give up her membership rights in the A. union, in order to qualify for and join
the I. union, the effect is the same. The question presented for determination
is whether or not claimant's separation from her employment was with or without
good cause within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Section 593.1(b)
permits the voluntary leaving of employment without disqualification if
circumstances have developed in the course of such employment which would have
justified the claimant in refusing such employment in the first instance under
the conditions set forth in subdivision 2 of that section. Section 593.2(a)
permits an individual to refuse employment without disqualification if the
acceptance of such employment would interfere with his joining or retaining
membership in any labor organization. We are of the opinion that the condition
imposed upon the claimant, in order for her to remain in her employment,
constituted an interference with her retaining membership in the labor
organization of her choice (Appeal Board 15,517-47). Under Section 593 of the
Law, her voluntary leaving was with good cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A combined hearing was
held at which claimant and representatives of the protesting employer and of
the Industrial Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a laboratory
assistant, filed an original claim for benefits effective February 11, 1952,
thereby establishing his base period as February 12, 1951, through February 11,
1952. He filed additional claims effective May 19 and May 23. By initial determination,
claimant was disqualified for 4 consecutive days effective May 19 for voluntary
leaving of employment without good cause. Another initial determination ruled
that as of May 23, claimant was not subject to a similar disqualification.
Claimant's last employer objected to that determination, demanding a hearing,
and deposited $10 as required by Section 620.1(c) of the Unemployment Insurance
Law, contending that claimant should have been disqualified for 42 days
effective May 23 in addition to the first disqualification. Pursuant to its
practice, the insurance office withheld claimant's benefits for 42 days as of
May 23, subject to the outcome of this proceeding. That office finally
determined that the first disqualification was not terminated by claimant's
employment on May 22. Claimant worked for a drug manufacturing firm for
approximately two months through noon of May 16. He occasionally ran errands
for the purpose of securing materials and supplies for use in the laboratory.
On May 15, his supervisor directed him to go to a firm, five or six blocks
away, for chemical supplies. Claimant refused to comply because it was raining,
and he was then told that the following day would be his last on the job.
Later, after the rain stopped, claimant approached the supervisor and
volunteered to run the errand. He was permitted to do so, but upon his return,
when he asked the supervisor whether the job was still his, he received a
negative response. On the next morning, claimant's father attempted to
communicate with the supervisor in an effort to secure claimant's retention of
the job. In view of what had occurred, claimant believed that intercession
would be fruitless, and he asked his father not to intercede. The employment
was terminated. On May 21, claimant accepted referral at the employment office
to a job as an assistant in a laboratory. At the employment interview,
according to him, he was hired to start work on the following day, in the
laboratory. He accepted the job on a permanent basis. On the following day,
however, he was assigned to work only in the factory. He quit the job for that
reason. The insurance office determined that this leaving was with good cause
in view of the variance between the duties for which claimant was hired and
those to which he was assigned. He had never worked for this firm before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: 1. The termination of
claimant's first employment was correctly charged to him as a voluntary leaving
without good cause. Claimant had performed errands before and it cannot be said
that they were outside the scope of his job. 2. The firm for which claimant
worked on May 22 was not, in my opinion, legally affected by the determination
which ruled claimant not subject to a 42-day disqualification effective May 23.
Claimant did not work for that firm during his base period, and accordingly any
benefits paid to him during his current benefit year will not be charged to its
account. (Unemployment Insurance Law, Section 581). It follows that the
protesting employer has no standing to contest the payment of benefits to
claimant. (<u>Matter of Crockett v. International Railway Company</u>, 170 App.
Div. 122;&nbsp;<u>Matson</u>&nbsp;<u>Terminals Inc. v. Employment Commission</u>,
24 Cal. 2d 695;&nbsp;<u>Bodison, Manufacturing</u>&nbsp;<u>Co. v. Employment

Conn. 164; see Pennock,&nbsp;<u>Unemployment Compensation and Judicial Review</u>,
88 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 137). The Appeal Board decisions on the subject arose prior
to the so-called experience rating amendments of 1951. (L. 1951, ch. 645).
Considered generally, none of those which explicitly dealt with the problem
reflects a rationale contrary to the views here expressed. (14,652-47;
14,588-47; 8,119-42; 7,094-42; 7,031-42; 4,098-40; 4,040-40; 3,901-40; cf.
19,044-49). In the&nbsp;<u>Crockett</u>&nbsp;case, an employer insured through
the state fund appealed from a Workmen's Compensation award in favor of an
injured employee. The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal, saying (170 App.
div. at 123):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&quot;It
is true that the employer has a remote interest even though insured in the
State fund, to the end that the risk which he claims not to be within the
account may be so decided as affecting any subsequent premiums which he must
pay. That interest, however, is to remote an interest to authorize his appeal
in a matter where he is not otherwise aggrieved.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it seems apparent that the employer whose reserve account is affected is the
only person having sufficient incentive to challenge a decision awarding
benefits.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>In the&nbsp;<u>Winchester</u>&nbsp;case,
a non-base year employer protested the payment of benefits to its former
employees who were on strike. The Connecticut Court refused to entertain the
appeal, commenting that the employer was not legally aggrieved even by the
possibility that a substantial drain of the Unemployment Insurance Fund might
cause it as well as other subject employers to pay emergency contributions. (Cf<u>.
Gange Lumber Co. v. Rowley</u>, 326 U.S. 295). A number of other jurisdictions,
it is true, have ruled that a last, albeit not a base period, employer has
legal standing to challenge the payment of benefits<u>. (Tube Reducing Corp. v.
Unemployment Compensation Commission</u>, 136 N.J. L. 410;&nbsp;<u>Chrysler
Corp. v. Unemployment Compensation Commission</u>, 301 Mich. 351;&nbsp;<u>Chrysler</u>&nbsp;<u>Corp.
v. Smith</u>, 297 Mich 438;&nbsp;<u>Susquehanna Collieries Co. v. Board of
Review</u>, 136 Pa. sup. 110, affd. on opinion below, 338 Pa. St. 1. The rationale
of these decisions, however, requires a conclusion that every subject employer
is legally aggrieved by the payment of benefits to any claimant. (Cf.&nbsp;<u>Pennock</u>,
88 U. of Pa. L. Rev. at 141). The better rule is to deny legal standing to an
employer whose &quot;interest in the moneys of the Treasury . . . is
comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation,
of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no
basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of
equity.&quot; (<u>Massachusetts v. Mellon</u>, 262 U.s. 447,487). To quote the
Court of Appeals: &quot;The fact that it (the order appealed from) may remotely
or contingently affect interests which he represents does not give him a right
to appeal.&quot; (<u>Ross v.</u>&nbsp;<u>Wigg</u>, 100 N.Y. 243,246; see
also&nbsp;<u>Davis</u>,&nbsp;<u>Standing to Challenge and to Enforce</u>&nbsp;<u>Administrative
Action</u>, 49 Col. L.R. 759, 788-789; Report to Joint Legislative Committee on
Unemployment Insurance /1951/ Appx. B, pp. 32-33). 3. The employer is not entitled
to the return of its deposit. Section 620.1 (c) provides for the return
&quot;if the referee modifies or overruled the initial determination&quot; but
that &quot;if the referee confirms the initial determination, the commissioner
shall pay such deposit into the fund and credit the general account.&quot; The
initial determination that claimant was not subject to disqualification
effective May 23, is not being modified or overruled herein. The decision that
the employer is not entitled to a hearing is, in effect, a confirmation of the
determination. In re&nbsp;<u>Lee</u>, 171 F 266;&nbsp;<u>Licklider v. Brown</u>,
12 F. 2d 567; In re&nbsp;<u>Malkan</u>, 265 F. 868). Although the Appeal Board
has ruled that the employer is entitled to the return where the confirmation is
based upon a failure to pay the deposit within the statutory period and
therefore its non-entitlement to a hearing (Appeal Board, 29,853-51) the Board
has limited this exception to a case where, among other things &quot;the
payment of benefits to claimant continues until the (preliminary) issue . . .
has been decided.&quot; Claimant herein, however, did not receive benefits for
at least 42 days effective May 23. 4. Claimant accepted the employment on May
22 on a permanent basis. His unemployment thereafter was not attributable to
his voluntary quit on May 15. The disqualification effective May 19 was,
therefore, terminated by his work on May 22. The initial determination that
claimant was not subject to another disqualification effective May 23, remains
in effect; the determination that claimant's work on May 22 did not terminate
the disqualification effective May 19 is overruled. (July 16, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

expected that the deposit device will have a favorable effect on employers'

notified of the filing of a claim for benefits and, at the same time, is
required (by regulation which has the force and effect of law) to give the
commissioner, on request, all information in his possession which bears in any
way on the claimant's eligibility. As a consequence of the experience rating
provisions of this Act, the employer will have a financial incentive to furnish
such information. If he does, and if the information is relevant, the claimant
may be disqualified and there will be no need for the employer to ask for a
hearing on the commissioner's determination of the claim. If he does not, or if
the information furnished by him is irrelevant, then it is proper that he
should be penalized, for his neglect and lack of cooperation with the

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testified. Claimant, a bookkeeper and secretary,
refiled for benefits effective September 8, 1952. By initial determination
effective the same date, she was disqualified for 42 consecutive days for
voluntary leaving of employment without good cause. The disqualification was
terminated effective September 15 when claimant became re-employed. Claimant
was hired on September 2 at $7/week, the prevailing rate, for a five-day, 35
-hour week. On September 5 she was paid for the full week including September 1
by check for $65 less deductions, and $5 from petty cash. Claimant was told
that she would be paid on the record at the rate of $65, and would receive $5
from petty cash each week, which would be to her advantage. Claimant did not
return to the position. Claimant obtained other employment on September 15.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant left her job
because the employer paid her salary in the correct amount, but carried her on
the record in a smaller sum. Although she professed a belief that this would
not preclude the employer from reducing her salary to $65 at any time in the
future, I find that her reason for leaving was the moral and ethical one and
that the arrangement was in violation of law. Voluntary leaving of employment
is with good cause when the employee is requested to be a party to wrongful
action by the employer. The initial determination is overruled. (December 3,
1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for benefits on March 15, 1951. At about that time, she was interviewed at the
local office and questioned concerning the care of her two children, ages 4 and
6 years. She advised that she had made satisfactory arrangements for the care
of her children in the event that she worked. Claimant appeared at the local
office on June 28 with one of her children. She was questioned at that time as
to the reason why she brought her child and stated that she was taking the
child to the doctor's office on that date. She was further questioned as to her
arrangements for child care if she worked and she supplied the local office
with the names and addresses of two sisters, ages 15 and 16, both residing one
block from her home, with whom she had made arrangements to take care of her
children while she worked. One of these sisters had taken care of her children
after school hours when claimant had previously worked on the night shift and
claimant paid her $1.00 a day. Claimant's uncle who is retired and who resides
with her attends to the children when she works on the day shift. On the following
day, claimant was questioned concerning the financial arrangements between her
and the baby sitters and she was requested to furnish a letter signed by the
baby sitters. She called at the home of the baby sitters and told them of the
local office request. The sisters informed claimant that they were willing to
give her the letter, but that &quot;it didn't seem important,&quot; and she did
not obtain the statements from the girls. In a written statement made at a
later local office interview on July 12, claimant asserted that she had already
furnished the names and addresses of the baby sitters to the office. An initial
determination was issued by the local office disqualifying claimant from
receiving benefits, effective June 18, 1951, for failure to meet reporting
requirements in that she did not submit the requested letter from the baby
sitters. Claimant was at all times ready and willing to accept employment on
any shift. She continued to report at the local office until July 15, 1951. On
July 16, 1951, through her own efforts, she obtained permanent employment in a
laboratory and worked there until January 1952, when she was forced to leave
because she became sensitized to penicillin. Soon thereafter she obtained
permanent employment as an assembler.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee ruled that claimant sufficiently
complied with all reporting requirements by furnishing the names and addresses
of the parties she had engaged to act as baby sitters. The Commissioner
contends on this appeal that claimant's failure to supply a letter form the
baby sitters as requested constitutes a failure to comply with reporting
requirements and that claimant was properly disqualified. There is no question
in this case but that claimant was available for work and that she had made satisfactory
arrangements for the care of her children while she worked either on the day or
night shift. Any doubts in this respect are dispelled by her course of conduct
subsequent to the period in issue. Nor does it appear that her good faith was
at any time impugned. The sole question that remains is whether or not claimant
should be denied benefits for the period June 18, 1951 to July 15, 1951, when
she returned to employment. In any event, it would appear that under the
Commissioner's own theory the proper date of disqualification would be June 28
since that was the date on which it is alleged she failed to comply with
reporting requirements. When claimant furnished the names and addresses of the
two baby sitters to the local office at its request, it was then in receipt of
sufficient information to make the appropriate determination as to her rights.
It did so, and she was accordingly paid benefits up to the time of the incident
in question. The local office was at all times in a position to verify the information
furnished by claimant in the event they disbelieved her. The request of June 28
was made after the local office was already in possession of the necessary
information concerning claimant's status. The record establishes that claimant
acted in good faith and attempted to comply with the demand to obtain the
statements from the baby sitters but he was unsuccessful in her efforts. It
cannot be said, therefore, that claimant arbitrarily refused or sought to evade
compliance with the local office directive. In our view&nbsp;<u>Matter of
Sorrentino</u>, 277 App. Div. 1073, reversing Appeal Board, 20,361-49, on which
the Commissioner relies, has no application to the instant case. In the&nbsp;<u>Sorrentino</u>&nbsp;case,
the claimant therein refused for personal reasons to divulge the names and
addresses of employers allegedly contacted. The Court held that &quot;the
Commissioner is entitled to have answers to such questions which are reasonably
within the scope of the authority delegated to him&quot; and that the
claimant's refusal to answer the question warranted the denial of benefits to
him during the period of such refusal. In the instant case the claimant had
actually answered the local office questions and furnished the desired
information. Except for the short period involved, claimant's answers were
accepted and the payment of benefits to her was authorized. The claimant did
not refuse to answer any questions. Under all of the circumstances of this
case, we hold that the record does not provide a sufficient basis to support
the initial determination that claimant failed to comply with reporting
requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Industrial Commissioner from a decision of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal
Board, overruling an initial determination made by the Industrial Commissioner
disqualifying claimant from receiving unemployment insurance benefits effective
June 18, 1951, for failure to comply with local office reporting requirements.
The rule giving finality to factual determinations by the Appeal Board, when
based upon substantial evidence, is operative against the Industrial
Commissioner as well as against other parties (Sec. 623 Labor Law). The
Unemployment Insurance Referee and the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board both
found that the claimant had sufficiently complied with all reasonable reporting
requirements. A question had arisen as to the availability of the claimant for
employment because the claimant had small children whom she could not leave unless
she procured a &quot;baby sitter&quot; for them. The claimant advised the local
office that she had arranged with girls residing in her neighborhood to take
care of her children in the event she obtained employment. Upon request, she
gave the local office the names and addresses of the girls. The local office
insisted, however, that she obtain a letter or memorandum in writing which the
girls agreed to perform the services. This claimant declined to do. The
determination, under the circumstances, that the claimant had complied with the
reporting requirements is supported by the evidence. Decision of the
Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed, without costs. (December 30,

"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant's employer was engaged in the
manufacture of boilers and also of hulls for military tanks. It operated day
and night shifts. From January 28 to July 18, 1952, claimant was employed on
the night shift as an arc welder on boilers. Due to a lack of steel, the
employer discontinued the night shift on boilers. Because claimant had
insufficient seniority, the employer was unable to transfer claimant to work on
boilers on the day shift. However, claimant was offered employment as an arc
welder on military tanks. On account of his religious scruples claimant refused
to work on military tanks because they are instruments of destruction. As a
result of claimant's refusal to work on tanks the employer was compelled to lay
him off. Claimant is a member and minister of a religious society known as
Jehovah's Witnesses. The religious teachings of this sect prohibit its members
from participating in war. However, as to whether or not a member should engage
in the production of instruments of destruction is left to the individual
conscience of such member. claimant interpreted the teaching of his sect to
prohibit his engaging in the production of instruments of destruction. When
claimant applied for employment with this employer, he specified boiler shop
work for this reason. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective July 28,
1952 and registered for employment. Based upon a report from claimant's
employer and after an interview, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for 42 days,
effective July 28, 1952, on the ground that he voluntarily left his employment
without good cause. Claimant contested the initial determination and requested
a hearing. The referee sustained the initial determination and the claimant
appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

claimant had good cause under the Law for voluntarily leaving his employment.
The referee sustained the initial determination of the local office on the
premise that since claimant would not be penalized by his sect for engaging in
such work, his personal conscience and religious scruples cannot be deemed to
he good cause under the Law. We do not agree with the referee's position. The
term &quot;good cause&quot; as used in Section 593 of the Unemployment
Insurance Law need not be attributable or connected with the work but may be
personal to the claimant (Appeal Board, 9576-43;&nbsp;<u>Bliley Electric Co. v.
Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and Sturdevant,</u>&nbsp;158 Pa.
super 548, 45 A. (2d) 898). Thus we held that a claimant's refusal of
employment which would interfere with his sabbath observance is good cause
under the Law (Appeal Board, 17,684-48). The same principle was enunciated by
the Board of Review of Pennsylvania as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

evidence as now presented by the claimant discloses that claimant has been

There is no question in this case, and the referee so found, that claimant is
sincere in his objections to work on military implements on the basis of his
religious beliefs and that the acceptance of such work would be in fact an
offense to his religious and moral conscience. Under such circumstances, his
refusal to accept work on that nature was justifiable and the lay off which

to such effect was made in his identification booklet. Subsequently, a notation
was made on his insurance office record card that he was due to report to the

Claimant reported to the insurance office on his regular due date, July 2, and

his identification booklet and certified for the weeks ending July 6, July 20
and July 27. He also reported to the employment office on July 30. The
alteration of his due date was noticed by a senior employment interviewer, who
retained claimant's identification booklet and forwarded it to the insurance

findings of fact, that based upon the foregoing, together with an interview had

claimant ineligible to receive benefits, effective July 1 through July 29,

an overpayment of $120 in benefits by reason thereof, on the ground that he
failed to comply with reporting requirements. His benefit were forfeited for 24
effective days because of a wilful false statement in order to obtain benefits.
Claimant protested the determinations and requested a hearing. The referee
modified the initial determination by holding claimant ineligible to receive
benefits effective July 1, 1952 and crediting claimant with the filing of an
additional clam effective July 2, 1952, reducing the overpayment to $7.50. The
referee sustained the determination as to misrepresentation. The Industrial

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee properly concluded that the
alteration of the reporting date was not made by anyone connected with the
Division of Employment, and that since claimant did not report to the
employment office as directed on July 1, 1952, he should not have received
credit for that day as a day of unemployment. We do not agree with the
referee's conclusion that claimant should have been credited with the filing of
an additional claim on July 2, 1952, since he reported to the insurance office
on that day. Such holding is contrary to the regulations of the Industrial
Commissioner, adopted by the Commissioner under authority to do so as provided
by the Law. Regulation 42 requires a claimant to report to the employment
office on the day he is directed to do so. (subd. (c)thereof provides:
&quot;The day on which claimant fails to report in accordance with this
regulation and any subsequent day prior to the date of a report to the
placement office, shall not be registered as days of total unemployment.&quot;
This is a reasonable and necessary regulation for proper administration of the
Law. Since claimant did not report to the placement office until July 30, the
local office properly held claimant ineligible to receive benefits for the
entire period from July 1 through July 29, 1952, and we find no circumstance in
this case to warrant any deviation from the regulation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Hearings were held at
which claimant and representatives of the Industrial Commissioner appeared.
Testimony was taken. Claimant filed for benefits on May 29, 1950. She was
disqualified for refusal of employment by initial determination effective
August 4. Claimant has had over eight years experience as a legal stenographer.
During the last three years, her salary was $55 a week. On August 4, the
employment office offered claimant employment as legal stenographer at $50 a
week. Claimant refused the job because the salary was too low. She also
objected to the travel time because it would take her about an hour to travel
from her home in Brooklyn to the employer's place of business in midtown
Manhattan. According to the Bureau of Research and Statistics, most legal
stenographers earn $50 to $60 a week. A survey of the salaries paid to legal
stenographers showed that about 21 percent received $50 a week, about 25
percent received $55 a week and about 26 percent received $60 a week. In
current job orders in the employment office usually $50 a week was offered.
According to claimant, employers advertising in the New York Law Journal
offered $55 to $60 a week. She has been employed since August 18 at $55 a week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

years, claimant has been earning $55 a week. She obtained another position at

the best available evidence of the prevailing rate for legal stenographers with
her training and experience. She was, accordingly, justified in refusing the
job offer in question because the salary offered was substantially less
favorable than the prevailing rate. I find $55 to $60 weekly to be the pay rate
received by the majority of legal stenographers with claimant's training and
lengthy experience. The initial determination is overruled. (January 26, 1951)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employment office, claimant through her own efforts, obtained a position as a
law stenographer at a starting salary of $55 a week. The Board is of the
opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and correctly determined
the issue involved in this case. The decision of the referee is affirmed.

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant was employed
as a law stenographer for eight years. For three years she received $55 a week.
She was laid off, filed a claim for benefits and was offered a job as law
stenographer at $50 a week for five days. This offer was refused by claimant
because the salary was too low. The referee and the Appeal Board have agreed
with claimant and have held she was &quot;justified in refusing the job offer
in question because the salary offered was substantially less favorable than
the prevailing rate.&quot; It is found that &quot;most legal
stenographers&quot; earn from $50 to $60 a week. The finding also is that $55
to $60 a week is the pay rate received by the &quot;majority&quot; of legal
stenographers &quot;with claimant's training and experience.&quot; The test
cannot be so specialized as a matter of law under the theory of the statute.
The refusal to accept an offer of employment is justified where the offer is
&quot;substantially less favorable . . . than those prevailing for similar work
in the locality.&quot; (Unemployment Insurance Law, Sec. 593, sub. 5(d))

     of those workers who have the same special characteristics as claimant.
     The approach caused difficulties on frequent occasions and has been
     challenged from time to time. Job offers placed by employers with the
     Employment Service and wages generally offered to new employees may be
     below such specialized majority range which is too frequently influenced
     by periodic salary advancements of employees on the job and by other
     similar factors. The Referee in the case under discussion found that
     &quot;in current job orders in the employment office usually $50 a week
     was offered, which was the rate offered to claimant. It is also often felt
     that a claimant is not a proper beneficiary under the Unemployment
     Insurance Program after he refused otherwise suitable employment that is
     offered at wages which compare with those currently paid to a substantial
     number of workers.<o:p></o:p></span></li>

twenty years experience, was thus employed until the early part of December
1951, when she was laid off due to lack of work. She refiled for benefits
effective December 20, 1951, and registered for employment. Claimant is a
member of a trade union having jurisdiction over her occupation. She was
recalled to work by her employer on January 21, 1952. On December 18, 1951,
claimant was referred to employment at her customary occupation with an
employer who was then manufacturing a $12.75 line of dresses. The employment
was with an employer who maintained contractual relations with the labor union
of which claimant is a member. Union piecework rates were paid by the employer.
She accepted the referral and after working one day, on December 19, 1951,
voluntarily left such employment, maintaining that she could not earn
sufficient wages. Claimant's previous employment, with her regular employer,
for the most part, consisted of work on dresses in the $16.75 to $18.75 price
range. On occasion, she worked on higher priced dresses when her employer had
such work available for her. The referral to the employment in question
occurred during a seasonal slack period in the industry. According to a
conversion chart prepared by the New York State Employment Service, persons
customarily employed as operators on a $16.75 line may be referred to work on
dresses ranging in price from $10.75 through $26.75 during slack periods in the
industry. Persons customarily employed as operators on an $18.75 line may be
referred to lines selling from $12.75 through $26.75 during such slack periods.
Based on an interview and the foregoing, the local office issued an initial
determination disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits for the period
December 20, 1951 through January 23, 1952, on the ground that she voluntarily
left her employment without good cause. Claimant requested a hearing and the
referee overruled he initial determination. The Industrial Commissioner
appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee, in overruling the initial
determination of the local office, concluded that claimant's experience had
been in the higher priced field. He held that, according to the conversion
chart described above, she should have been referred to employment in the
$16.75 to $29.75 price line. We are not in accord with this view. Claimant's
contention that she normally worked on a $22.75 line of dresses, is not
sustained by the record herein. It appears that while she may have had some
experience in this price line, nevertheless, the bulk of her work was on the
$16.75 to $18.75 price line. According to the conversion table, it was
permissible, during seasonal slack periods, to refer her to work on cheaper
lines. The referral was proper since it was within the conversion range
contained in the chart. Claimant was properly classified. She is reasonably
fitted by training and experience for the job to which she was referred. We are
persuaded moreover, that had claimant tried the work for a period longer than one
day, she would have become more proficient at it and thus would have had
greater earnings. Claimant voluntarily left her employment without good cause.
In our opinion, the testimony hereinabove referred to (Appeal Board, 22,912-50)
is not germane to the facts of this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

received a B.S. degree in economics. Prior to March 1952 he was employed for
about six months as an office manager for a milling company. From April 7, 1952
to July 19, 1952 he worked for the instant employer, a large co-operative,
dealing in farm products. Claimant had applied to this employer for a position
as trainee-manager. In the interview for that position, claimant was told that
he would have to start as a warehouseman involving stock work of a laborious
nature, that he would be subject to transfers from one locality to another and
that advancements would be made on the basis of merit. No estimates were given
to claimant as to when various stages in his advancement would take place. The
employer operates in three states and has over 300 retail outlets. It handles
7,000 different items. Under its training program college graduates begin as
warehousemen or stock clerks in order to familiarize themselves with the
products handled by the company. Trainees for executive positions are later
transferred to counter work and other types of work so that they may learn all
phases of the employer's business. There is no timetable of advancement but
such trainees usually reach the position of assistant manager within a two-year
period. Claimant is married, resided in Binghamton and he was originally
assigned to the Liberty, New York store and moved to that city with his wife.
He continued to work in Liberty at a salary of $62.50 a week until July 10,
1952 when he was transferred to the employer's Batavia store at $65 per week.
While in Liberty claimant suffered an injury to his back as a result of which
he was attended by a physician who recommended that he use a surgical belt.
Claimant was advised that his duties in the Batavia store would continue to be
those of a warehouseman. He complained to the store manager and to the district
manager that he had enough of that type of work and was told that he would be
kept on that work for about another three months, after which he would be
transferred to counter work. He thereupon gave notice that he was leaving his
job on July 19, 1952, stating that &quot;he was not suited for the work&quot;,
and did so. Claimant felt that with his education and background he had had
sufficient work at the laboring level and that his education was not being
employed to the best of his ability. He had no prospect of other employment at
the time. Claimant filed a claim for benefits effective July 21, 1952. He
stated at the local office that he left his job because of &quot;unsuitable
work.&quot; The local office issued an initial determination ruling claimant
eligible for benefits on the ground that he was forced to leave his position
because of fear of future physical injury to his back, the apparent agreement
of the employer that he was unable to do heavy work, lack of training by the
company leading to promotional possibilities, frequent transfers, desire to use
his college education, expense involved in maintaining two homes and his
feeling of frustration of no future with the employer in question. The employer
protested the initial determination and requested a hearing. The referee sustained
the initial determination, from which decision the employer appealed to this
Board. The employer's appeal was accompanied by the statutory deposit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee sustained the determination of
eligibility on the ground that claimant was justified in leaving his
employment. He reasoned that claimant, a college graduate, should not have been
required to do laborer's work for a long period of time with the hope of
receiving a promotion when no promotions were in sight or promised for the near
future. The employer contends on this appeal that claimant was undergoing the
usual program for college graduates training for executive work with it; that
claimant knew in advance the nature of that program and that his leaving was
due to his dissatisfaction with the manual work involved and his unwillingness
to complete the required training period. It is argued that on such a basis
claimant's leaving was without good cause. We believe there is substantial
merit to the employer's position. Concededly, claimant knew in advance and
agreed to undertake a training period involving manual labor and transfers in
the locale of his employment. He was advised that the employer's training
program called for such work because in the employer's judgment this was the
best way to acquaint trainees with all of the complex phases of the employer's
business. Although claimant did suffer from an injury to his back, it does not
appear that he attributed his leaving to that cause. In his original statement
to the local office he stated that he would not have left the job had he been
transferred to a smaller store where he could receive training. Under the facts
established, it is the opinion of this Board that claimant voluntarily left his
employment because he disagreed with the employer's method of training
employees for executive positions and further because be was disappointed with
the progress which he made in three months. We do not deem this to constitute
good cause for leaving employment within the meaning of the Unemployment
Insurance Law, and we so hold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was had at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and the Industrial
Commissioner appeared and testimony was taken. Claimant, a snap machine
operator, filed a claim effective March 31, 1952. By initial determination
effective the same date, she was disqualified for voluntary leaving of
employment without good cause and for withdrawal from the labor market, until
42 days elapsed after certification to a bona fide return to the labor market.
By another initial determination, she was charged with an overpayment of $60.
Claimant was employed from September 1946 to September 20, 1951, by a manufacturer
of men's jewelry, belts, etc., as a snap machine operator, at a base rate of 90
cents per hour, plus piecework rates. She was granted a sick leave from
December 21, 1951 to April 4, 1952, because of a nervous condition. The
employer reported to the insurance office that claimant called at the
establishment on April 3, 1952, and voluntarily signed a statement that she was
leaving her employment because of illness; and that she had in no way indicated
that she was interested in employment of any kind. Claimant emphatically denied
that she voluntarily resigned. She reported for work on April 3, and informed
the employer that due to her nervous condition her physician had instructed her
to refrain from performing employment on a piecework basis, and that she
requested employment on an hourly basis. She was informed that none was
available. The employer submitted a copy of the statement signed by the
claimant in which it was alleged that she voluntarily left her employment
because of health reasons. Such statement did not indicate that claimant
voluntarily left her employment. It reveals that she was unwilling to return to
employment on a piecework basis. Claimant submitted a statement secured from
her physician which revealed that she had been under his care from January 30,
1950, and that she suffered from a nervous condition. The doctor indicated that
piecework should be avoided. Claimant was a member of an independent union
which was in contractual relationship with the employer. Under the union
agreement, it appears that she had a right to &quot;bump&quot; other workers
with less seniority from their employment. Claimant understood that this
applied on a departmental basis and did not know that she could
&quot;bump&quot; employees on a plant-wide basis. There were no hourly rate
jobs in claimant's department. After leaving her employment, claimant made
diligent efforts to secure other employment not involving working on a
piecework basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: While there is a sharp
conflict in the testimony, I resolve the doubt in favor of claimant. The
credible testimony reveals that claimant on April 3, when she reported to the
employer, was ready and willing to accept employment whereby she would not be
required to work on a piecework basis and was informed that such work was not
available for her. She was not aware that under the union agreement she had a
right to &quot;bump&quot; another hourly employee on a plant-wide basis; nor
was she so informed by the employer's representative. She had good cause for
leaving her employment because working on a piecework basis proved detrimental
to her health and well being. There is a complete lack of evidence to show that
she withdrew from the labor market. To the contrary, she made reasonable
efforts to secure other work after separating from her former employment. I
conclude that claimant did not voluntarily leave her employment without good
cause and did not withdraw from the labor market. She was not overpaid in
benefits. The initial determinations are overruled. (September 11, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;After a careful
review of the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and
before the Board, and due deliberation having been had thereon, and having
found that the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law are fully
supported by the evidence in this case, and that no error of fact or law appear
to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of
law made by the referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of this
Board, except as follows: The Board makes the additional findings of fact that
on April 3, 1952, claimant voluntarily resigned from her employment because she
was not physically able to continue her former work; and although under the
union agreement claimant had the right to demand the jobs of other workers with
less seniority, she failed to do so. Under such circumstances, claimant's
voluntary leaving of her employment is deemed to be without good cause and it
is so held. When claimant filed an application for benefits she did not
disclose pertinent facts which would have affected the determination as to the
filing of a valid original claim. The Board is of the opinion that the referee
made proper findings of fact and correctly determined the issue involved in
this case, except as modified herein. The initial determination of the local
office is modified by holding that claimant is disqualified for 42 days,
effective March 31, 1952, for voluntary leaving of employment without good
cause. Claimant was overpaid $60 in benefits. The decision of the referee is
modified accordingly and, as so modified, is affirmed. (January 23, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Claimants filed effective November 17, 1952. By initial determinations
effective the same date, they were disqualified for 42 days for voluntary
leaving of employment without good cause. Claimants' union was in contractual
relations with their employer. R___ and Sa___ are merrow machine operators.
Sc___ is a sewing machine operator. Each had worked for the employer for many
years at union-agreed piecework rates. Prior to November 1952, the employer
applied to the union for assistance because the firm was operating at a
deficit. After investigation by the union, it was determined that the firm was
losing money because it paid wages higher than that paid by other employers in
similar work and its method of work was uneconomic. In the first week of
November, an agreement was made between the employer and the union whereby the
method of work was altered. Before such agreement, the garments polo shirts,
had been manufactured from the waist up to the shoulders. The correct method
was from the top to the bottom because an operation known as tacking was
thereby eliminated. In addition, it was agreed that wages be reduced by
eliminating payment of 15 cents extra for each hour under 35 per week, 17½
cents extra for each hour between 35 and 40 per week, and 20 cents extra for
each hour over 40 per week. There was also a reduction in the piecework rate.
All time workers were changed to a piecework basis. All the employees were
affected by the change in rates and the agreement was ratified by the union
membership. The change in the method of production required an adjustment on
the part of the workers which ordinarily would take four to five weeks. The
change in the salary rate diminished the earnings of claimants. Claimants
terminated their employment because they objected to the reduction. R___ and
Sa___ also objected to the change in the method of working. Sa__ was notified
of the initial determination by mail on November 25. She orally protested the
determination on December 15 when appearing as a witness for R___. She
requested a hearing, in writing, on December 16. The Commissioner's
representative contended that here request was untimely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contractual obligations to make payments to the union retirement and health and

chairman of the industry. The union was thereupon relieved of its no strike
pledge as to the jobber and some time prior to June 17, called a strike against

the referee that the claimants did not lose their employment as the result of
an industrial controversy in the establishment in which they were employed nor
can we agree with the position taken by the Industrial Commissioner that the
jobber and the contractor herein should be treated as one entity. The facts
clearly show that the jobber and the contractor were two separate and distinct
entities for all purposes, except for the fact that the jobber was under
contractual obligation for certain payments to be made to the union for the
health, welfare and retirement fund and was under obligation to pay the
unemployment insurance tax based on the contractors payroll which funds were
for the benefit of the contractor's employees. An analysis of the record
clearly shows that these claimants were actually working on June 17 until about
noontime when they were informed that they were to report to the union. The
entire shop in accordance with the union request reported to the union
headquarters and did not return to the job until the difficulties between the
jobber and the union were straightened out. It is our opinion that these
claimants, when they were instructed to walk off their jobs at a time when work
was available for them, did so for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear
upon their employer, the contractor, to compel the jobber to meet his
contractual obligations with the union. Thus, the contractor's employees
extended the controversy between them and the jobber into the contractor's
establishment. It is our opinion that under these circumstances, the concerted
walkout by these claimants from their shop constituted an industrial
controversy in the establishment in which they were employed within the meaning
of the Law, and, accordingly, their rights to benefits should be suspended. In
view of our decision, there is no need to pass upon the request of some of
these claimants to predate their claims for benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the league in which claimant played started some time in October 1951 and ran
to March 16, 1952. Thereafter claimant returned to his home in Manitoba,
Canada, where he filed an interstate clam for benefits against New York as the
liable State, effective March 31, 1952. The employer reported to the
Out-of-State Resident Office on April 10, 1952, that claimant &quot;was signed
to a professional contract, which expired for the season March 16, 1952&quot;.
Claimant stated that he was paid only for the actual playing season and that he
received no payments during the summer months. The employer permitted the
players to accept any employment other than sports during the off-season.
Claimant customarily works at other employment following the termination of the
playing season. He applied for employment with a former employer and with a
railroad company in Florida. He succeeded in obtaining employment as a railroad
worker commencing June 1, 1952 and was thus employed until September 13, 1952.
An initial determination was issued holding claimant ineligible for benefits
effective March 31, 1952, on the ground that he was not totally unemployed in
that he was under an annual contract with the hockey organization. Claimant
protested and requested a hearing. The referee overruled the initial

Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The referee held that
under his contract with the employer claimant was compelled to either train or
play hockey during the training period and the regular hockey season, which
expired March 16, 1952 and that claimant was consequently totally unemployed
during the period of his reporting. The Industrial Commissioner contends that
since claimant was under contract for an annual period, he was legally bound to
furnish services throughout the year and thus not totally unemployed or
eligible for benefits during the entire year. The Commissioner's contention is
without adequate support in the record and we believe that the referee reached
the correct result in this case. The available evidence in the case establishes
that the contract between the parties contemplated that claimant would perform
services for the employer during the training and playing season only, which
extended from October 1951 to March 16, 1952; and that claimant was not
obligated under the contract to render any services nor was he subject to any
call by the employer after the season closed on March 16, 1952. It is
significant that the contract provides that if claimant were not to complete
the season he would receive only part of his salary in the ratio of the number
of days he actually worked to the number of days of the league schedule of
games. Moreover, after the playing season claimant returned to his home, many
hundreds of miles away, and with the knowledge of the employer, customarily
worked at other employment until the next season opened. We are impressed with
the argument advanced by claimant that his obligation to report to the
employer's training camp in the fall was intended merely to prevent him from
signing up with another club and that it in no way affected his status as a
free agent following the playing season. The opinion in Appeal Board, 34,619-52
is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. On the
basis of the written contract an all the circumstances herein, we hold that
claimant was totally unemployed and available for employment during the period
at issue. The initial determination of the Out-of-State Resident Office holding
claimant ineligible for benefits, effective March 31, 1952, on the ground that
he was not totally unemployed is hereby overruled. The decision of the referee
is affirmed. (February 27, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant is a professional
hockey player. On October 10, 1951, he entered into a written contract with the
Professional Hockey Club of Syracuse, Inc., by the terms of which &quot;The
Club hereby employs the Player as a skilled Hockey Player for the term of one
year commencing Oct. 1, 1951.&quot; Claimant's annual salary was to be
$4,000.00, payable in consecutive semi-monthly installments, following the
commencement of the League games. If claimant was not in the club's employ for
the entire period of the League games, then his salary was to be that sum of
money equal to the ratio of the number of days of his actual employment to the
number of days of the League games. The active playing season in the League
started during October, 1951, and continued until March 16, 1952. On March 31,
1952, claimant filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits. The
Industrial Commissioner ruled claimant ineligible on the ground he was not
totally unemployed. After a hearing a referee overruled the initial
determination of the Commissioner, and the Appeal Board affirmed the referee.
The Commissioner appeals from the decision of the Appeal Board. The appeal
poses only the question whether a professional athlete, hired on an annual
basis, for an annual salary, is &quot;totally unemployed&quot; within the meaning
of the Unemployment Insurance Law during the &quot;off-season&quot;. The
Unemployment Insurance Law (Labor Law, §511), defines &quot;employment in this
language: &quot;'Employment' means any service under any contract of employment
for hire, express or implied, written, or oral.&quot; At all times involved
here, Labor Law, § 522, provided: &quot;Total unemployment means the total lack
of any employment on any day, caused by the inability of a claimant who is
capable of and available for work to engage in his usual employment or in any
other for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience.&quot;
Looking at some of the terms of claimant's contract of employment we find
numerous obligations on the part of claimant beyond playing hockey and beyond
the &quot;league season.&quot; For instance, he was required to play in
&quot;exhibition&quot; games; to report for training &quot;at the time and
places fixed by the club in good physical condition&quot;' to participate
&quot;in any and all promotional activities of the club&quot;; to report for
practice &quot;at such time and place as the club may designate&quot;; if
disabled, &quot;to submit himself for medical examination and treatment by a
physician selected by the club&quot;; to permit the taking and use of any
photograph, motion picture or television of himself; to accept and be bound by
a assignment of his contract; to report to the assignee of his contract
&quot;at such time and place as directed in the notice of assignment&quot;; to
arbitrate any dispute, and to do other things. On the negative side, claimant
agreed not to do many things during the term of the contract, and such
provisions are not limited to the playing season. From the express terms of the
contract it would seem clear that claimant was obligated to perform services
not only during the playing season, but during the &quot;off-season,&quot; and
was paid his salary for his services and for his contractual obligation to
refrain from doing certain things during the entire year without limitation to
the actual playing season. We think he was &quot;employed&quot; during the
entire period of the contract, and, conversely, was not &quot;totally
unemployed&quot; within the intent and purpose of the Unemployment Insurance
Law. The fact that the employer may elect to permit claimant to be absent from
active duty during all or part of the off-season, or does not object to his doing
other work at such times, does not alter his legal status as
&quot;employed&quot; by it, for he must hold himself in readiness and is paid
therefor. To hold otherwise could open the door to an extension of the benefits
of unemployment insurance far beyond well-understood and expressed purposes of
the law. The Legislature recognized the need for the law to prevent the spread
and lighten the unemployment &quot;which now so often falls with crushing force
upon the unemployed worker and his family&quot; and expressly recognized it as
an improvement over &quot;the barren actualities of poor relief
assistance.&quot; (Labor Law, § 501). It is common knowledge that many
professional athletes and other seasonal employees receive very large annual
salaries and were not contemplated as beneficiaries of unemployment insurance,
though they do little or no actual work during the off-season. While there
appears to be no judicial authority in this state upon the precise question,
there is authority for quite analogous situations. (<u>Matter</u>&nbsp;<u>of
Leshner</u>&nbsp;(<u>Corsi</u>), 268 App. Div. 582;&nbsp;<u>Matter Korth</u>,
266 App. Div. 934, Lv. to appeal denied 292 N.Y. 724;&nbsp;<u>Matter of Steward
(Corsi</u>), 279 App. Div. 500). The weight of authority by Boards in other
jurisdictions is in accord with the view expressed herein. (<u>Missouri Unemployment
Insurance Compensation Commission</u>, decision No. IC - 4864 [1951 - hockey
player];&nbsp;<u>Pennsylvania Board of Review,</u>&nbsp;Decision No. B-27640,
Case No. B-44-99-D-2979 [baseball player]). The decision of the Unemployment
Insurance appeal Board should be reversed, and the initial determination of the
Industrial Commissioner reinstated, without costs. (December 8, 1953).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and representatives of the employer and of the Industrial
Commissioner appeared. Testimony was taken. Claimant filed for benefits
September 8, 1952, and by initial determination effective the same date he was
disqualified for 42 consecutive days for voluntarily leaving his last
employment without good cause. He was charged with an overpayment of $30. For
five years to June 2, 1952, claimant worked as an assembler for an automobile
manufacturer. Because of his wife's illness, he went into debt and decided that
he would seek more gainful employment. Prior to June 2 he arranged to take
over, on a concession basis, three stands in an amusement park. Claimant
realized that this venture would terminate around Labor Day and therefore made
arrangements to work in a plastic factory after Labor Day. After claimant had
his plans fully made, he resigned. Had he not assured himself of a steady
employment he would not have quit his job. Claimant is married and has five
dependents. Claimant operated his concessions from June 2 to Labor Day.
Unfortunately, there was a slump in the plastic industry and claimant was
unable to obtain the job in the fall that had been promised to him. The
Commissioner's representative argues that since the concession business was a
seasonal or temporary one, that claimant was correctly disqualified for leaving
the job with the automobile manufacturer even though it was not his last one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;After reviewing
the record, testimony and evidence adduced before the referee, and due
deliberation having been had thereon, and having found that the referee's
findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence in this case, and that no
error of fact appear to have been made, the Board adopts the findings of fact
made by the referee as the findings of fact of this Board, except as follows:
Claimant had no absolute commitment to work in a plastic factory after Labor
Day. He failed to disclose to the local office pertinent facts which would have
affected the initial determination as to his filing of a valid original claim.
Although we have adopted the findings of fact with the exception hereinabove
stated, we do not agree with the conclusion reached by the referee based
thereon that claimant had good cause for relinquishing his employment. A
careful consideration of the evidence herein, leads us to the conclusion that
claimant did not have good cause for leaving his employment within the meaning
of the Law. His motive in establishing himself in business in order to improve
his economic condition is understandable. However, claimant was aware of the fact
that such self-employment was of a temporary nature and would terminate by
Labor Day. For this reason Appeal Board, 17,480-48 relied on by the referee in
inapplicable to the instant case. Claimant's alleged arrangement to work in a
plastic factory after Labor Day was very indefinite and did not ripen into a
commitment. The disqualification for voluntarily leaving of employment imposed
by the local office against claimant was proper. The benefits he collected are
recoverable. The initial determination of the local office disqualifying
claimant from receiving benefits for 42 consecutive days, effective September
8, 1952 is sustained. Claimant was overpaid $30 in benefits. The decision of
the referee is reversed. (March 6, 1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>&nbsp;Claimant B., a
distributor, and claimant S., a packer, worked in an industrial laundry
employing about 450 persons. The claimants were members of a union in
contractual relations with the employer. A two-year contract governing the
terms and conditions of employment of the employees of the establishment was in
effect when, on May 8, 1952, about 35 or 40 employees, primarily in the
shipping department, ceased work and demanded wage increases. On the following
morning, a union official held a meeting at the employer's establishment
attended by about 250 plant employees including the claimants. He informed the
employees that the work stoppage was unauthorized by the union and in violation
of the existing collective bargaining agreement. He directed them to return to
work or suffer loss of their employment. The employer was willing to take up
the question of wage increases at a later date, but insisted that the employees
return to work. All of the employees in the plant did so, except about 30 or 35
persons including the claimants, who insisted that their demand for a wage
increase be granted immediately. The employer refused their demand and gave
notice that unless they returned to work, their jobs would be filled with new
employees. The claimants failed to return to work and the employer hired
replacements for their jobs. Claimant B. filed an original claim for benefits,
effective May 26, 1952. In each instance, an initial determination was issued
disqualifying the claimant for 42 consecutive days, effective the date of his
filing, on the ground that he had voluntarily left his employment without good
cause, and in the alternative, suspending his right to benefits, effective May
9 and May 10 respectively, for loss of employment due to an industrial
controversy. Claimant B. was ruled overpaid $66 in benefits. The referee having
overruled the initial determinations holding the claimants had voluntarily left
their employment without good cause, the Industrial Commissioner appealed to
this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant has had upwards of 20 years of
employment as a barber. On his last job, which he held for more than seven
years, his pay was $45 a week plus 50 percent of earnings over $60. Claimant
filed a claim for benefits August 18, 1952, and registered for employment. On
August 26, 1952, claimant was offered referral to employment as a barber. The
pay was $46 a week plus 50 percent of earnings over $66. Claimant refused the
referral because he was &quot;tired of being a barber&quot;. Claimant had been
suffering from an eye condition which was growing progressively worse, but did
not disclose this to the local office for fear that, had he done so, he would
not have been eligible for benefits. Claimant’s doctor had advised him to give
up the barber trade and seek another type of work not involving the constant
use of his eyes. Claimant had decided, therefore, to obtain a job as a watchman
or guard, which work he felt he was physically able to do. When claimant
reported to the employment service on October 14, 1952, he was reclassified
from barber to watchman. He was, at that time, referred to an agency for the
rehabilitation for the blind, where he reported, and is now awaiting his turn
for training. Claimant did not disclose that the true reason for refusing the
employment offered to him was his physical condition until the date of the
hearing before the referee. Based on an interview with claimant, the local
office issued an initial determination disqualifying claimant from receiving
benefits, effective August 26, 1952, on the ground that, without good cause, he
refused employment for which he is reasonably fitted by training and experience
and, an alternative determination holding claimant ineligible for benefits,
effective August 18, 1952, on the ground that he was unavailable for
employment. Claimant protested the determinations and requested a hearing. The
referee sustained that part of the initial determination holding claimant’s
refusal of employment was without good cause. Claimant appealed to this Board,
which, by decision dated November 21, 1952, affirmed the decision of the
referee. An application was duly made to the Board by claimant, pursuant to
Section 534 of the Unemployment Insurance Law, to reopen said decision of the
Board and was granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at the hearing before the Board, which the Referee did not have the opportunity
to consider, discloses that claimant has an eye condition which is
progressively deteriorating. It is therefore clear that claimant had good cause
for refusing the employment which was offered to him, because to have accepted
would have impaired his health. However, claimant’s failure to disclose this
condition to the local office personnel as a true reason for his refusal, rendered
him unavailable for employment within the meaning of the Law, in that it
precluded a proper occupational classification of claimant and the possibility
of referral to employment in his new classification. Claimant was, therefore,
unavailable effective August 26, 1952, the date of refusal, until he first
disclosed to the referee on September 24 the reason underlying his refusal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ineligible because of unavailability for employment. Since filing for benefits,
claimant has not sought employment other than as an actor and will not accept
any work other than as actor. He is using his present period of unemployment
and using his unemployment insurance benefits to further his career as an actor
by attending an acting class twice a week. Claimant worked as an actor for nine
weeks in a summer stock company in 1951 and for ten weeks in 1952. He last
worked August 24, 1952. In addition, claimant had two nights’ work on
television in 1952 and four weeks’ work as an actor in 1951. Claimant had 31
weeks’ intermittent employment from September 1951, to June 1952, as a salesman
and earned $1490, upon which earnings plus his nine weeks’ work in a summer
stock company his benefit rate is based. On January 23, claimant was asked to

this case, and that no errors of fact or law appear to have been made, the
Board adopts the findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the
referee as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of this Board, except we
find that claimant made some effort to find employment as an actor since his
last employment. However, claimant restricted his search for employment to the
acting profession only and refused to consider work in any other field. The
Board is of the opinion that the referee made proper findings of fact and
correctly determined the issue involved in this case, except as above.
Claimant’s restrictions of his search for employment to the acting profession

source of income during the base period was as a salesman, renders him
unavailable for employment within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance

27, 1952, as of which date by initial determination he was disqualified for 42
consecutive days for leaving employment voluntarily without good cause. The
employment in issue is that which claimant had aboard the S.S. Sea Legend. On

Accordingly, all crew personnel made a demand for overtime pay. The shipping
company was originally prepared to pay the overtime but on ascertaining that
$25,000 to $30,000 was involved, refused to pay unless the matter was
arbitrated. The vessel reached Coos Bay, Oregon on October 12, when claimant
left the ship, apparently because of the refusal of the company to meet his
demand for overtime pay which amounted to about $950. Claimant also filed for
federal old age benefits since he is past 65 years of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employer fails to pay wages due an employee, the latter has good cause for
leaving his employment. However, the wages in dispute here were not established
as due and owing to claimant. True, the employer, according to claimant, was
willing to pay for some of the overtime pay due, but on ascertaining the large
amount, withdrew its approval. This does not necessarily establish that the
employer conceded the contentions of the claimant and others similarly
situated. We have only the&nbsp;<u>ex parte</u>&nbsp;testimony of claimant that
the captain of the vessel was remiss in failing to post the necessary notices
or make the necessary entries in the log book. The disputed wages are still
under arbitration. (At least they were so in February 1953, the date of the
hearing in San Francisco.) I cannot make a conclusive finding that claimant was
entitled as a matter of fact and law to the wages in dispute. His allegation of
the amount due does not necessarily make the amount due. Accordingly, I hold that
his hasty departure from his job rather than his waiting to learn the outcome
of the arbitration proceeding, was an unreasonable act. Ordinary grievance
procedure is provided in the agreement between his union and the employer's
association. I hold that claimant left his employment voluntarily without good
cause. The initial determination is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: A hearing was held at
which claimant and a representative of the Industrial Commissioner appeared and
testified. Claimant, an insurance agent, filed for benefits on January 14, 1952.
By revised initial determination effective that date, he was ruled ineligible
because of unavailability. Claimant was employed by an insurance company for 27
years to December 31, 1951, on which date he was involuntarily retired. He
receives a pension of $85 per month from his employer, and Federal Old Age
benefits at the rate of $67 per month. His wife receives such benefits at $33
per month. Claimant alleged that he was willing to work and has been actively
seeking employment. Most of his contacts were for work as salesman, a field in
which he has had his only work experience. He estimated that he applied for
work at approximately 150 different establishments. He applied for work with
manufacturers in the garment center, a package liquor store, a hardware store,
a jewelry store, a glove manufacturer and a department store. At the insurance
office he indicated that he desired a minimum salary of $50 a week but would
accept $45 a week. At the hearing, he reduced that minimum to $40 per week. He
alleged that it would not pay him to forego his social security benefits at any
salary lower than $40 per week. Since approximately March 24, he has been
answering advertisements taken from a local newspaper. He estimated he answered
six such advertisements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: Claimant has exhibited
his attachment to the labor market by a sustained effort to find employment.
However, the bulk of his employment contacts have been in search of sales work,
the only field in which he had previous experience. Because of his receipt of
social security benefits, he would not accept less than $40 per week. In view
of his lack of experience in any field other than insurance sales, his salary
requirement is not realistic. In effect, he would be required to accept the
usual rate paid to inexperienced workers. Accordingly, I find that claimant’s
restriction, when taken together with his age and prior work history,
substantially limited his opportunities of becoming employed and he was
correctly ruled ineligible because of unavailability. The initial determination
is sustained. (April 8, 1952)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Opinion and Decision</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>: This case suggests the
rising pressure of an aging population upon public unemployment insurance
facilities; but the economic and social questions it raises are somewhat
broader than the legal point which brings it here. Claimant is now sixty-seven
years old. For twenty-seven years he was employed by the Prudential Insurance
Company as an industrial insurance agent. He was an &quot;honor award
winner&quot; of the company. At the end of 1951, when he was sixty-five, he was
involuntarily retired. He was then earning $5,000 a year. He did not want to
stop work; he was in good health; but the policy of the company seems to have
been to retire employees in this class at that age. Prudential allowed him a
net pension of $76 a month. When his employment stopped he also received social
security benefits of $67 a month; his wife from the same source received $33 a
month. The total family net income from these three sources was $176 a month,
or about $46 a week. Claimant then began an assiduous search for employment. He
testified he saw 150 persons in the course of his search. He said: &quot;I go
to friends, associates; some of my old policyholders. I am willing to work
because I am able to work although I am not so young. I don’t want even the
social security.&quot; Since the claimant was receiving $46 a week, and since
if he took employment his social security benefits would be suspended, he felt
that he ought not to take employment at less than $50 a week. He was unable to
obtain employment at this rate. He then reduced his demand to $45 weekly, and
later agreed to accept employment at $40 a week. Even at this rate he was
unable to get employment. He tried the field of clerical work in which he had
been engaged many years ago; he tried to obtain work as a salesman. He
addressed a letter to the Division of Placement and Unemployment Insurance in
which he said: &quot;I am willing, ready and able to work. I am now devoting my
time and effort to visiting business establishments and am willing to accept
any position doing clerical work or any selling job as I am an experienced
salesman.&quot; On claimant’s application to the Division of Placement and
Unemployment Insurance for unemployment benefits, the ruling of the division
was that he was unavailable for employment within the purpose of the statute.
The referee on review affirmed this determination of unavailability. The
referee found that while claimant had exhibited &quot;his attachment to the
labor market by sustained effort to find employment&quot; his salary
requirement was &quot;not realistic&quot; because all he could reasonably
expect to receive would be the &quot;usual rate paid to inexperienced
workers&quot;. The referee concluded that the restriction placed by claimant on
the amount of salary &quot;when taken together with his age and prior work
history&quot; operated to limit &quot;his opportunities of becoming
employed&quot;. This decision was affirmed by the Appeal Board. We think the
decision is within the scope and intent of the statute. It is a mater of
growing importance to the community to continue to utilize the skills and experience
of its older people; and as the life span expands the problem becomes
progressively more pressing. The Unemployment Insurance Law is intended to
protect and continue the working activity of all members of the community. It
is not merely for the protection of young workers but also of workers of
advanced years who remain in the labor market. We take unusual care in this
decision not to suggest or to imply that age alone necessarily results in
non-availability in the labor market. Availability is the statutory test; but
it must be applied individually to the facts of each case as the administrator
sees them. Age, linked to a lack of physical or mental capacity to work, or age
coupled with restrictions, which cut down greatly the possibility of
employment, may fairly result in a finding of non-availability. But an able
aged man is an available man if he has remaining abilities that can be sold on
the market. When such a man is willing to meet the market his employment is
covered by the statute. In affirming the determination in this case we hold
merely that on this record it was within the power of the Board to find that
the restrictions imposed by claimant himself kept him aloof from the market.
The determination should be affirmed with costs. (May 13,1953)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

November 1951 claimant worked as a caretaker in a greenhouse. On January 13,
1952 he obtained employment as a night watchman at a salary of $58.16 a week
and worked on the job until June 8, 1952 and again from July 8, 1952 to
December 10, 1952. He left his employment on each occasion because he did not
want to forfeit his disability benefits. He reported for work in January 1952
but the employer refused to continue him on the job because it wanted a
permanent employee. Claimant's disability pension was cancelled by the Railroad
Retirement Board effective January 1, 1953, because claimant's earnings in
December 1952, exceeded $75. Claimant filed a claim for benefits, effective
December 29. 1952. In an interview he stated that he had left his employment as
watchman on both occasions because, in order to receive his disability
benefits, he is not allowed to earn more than $75 in each of six consecutive
months. The local office issued an initial determination holding claimant
ineligible for benefits, effective December 29, 1952, on the ground that he was
unavailable for employment. The basis of the determination was that claimant
imposed unreasonable restrictions upon his availability by refusing to give up
his pension and would have to leave his employment every six months. Claimant
contested the determination and requested a hearing. At the hearing the
Industrial Commissioner issued an added initial determination, effective
December 29, 1952, disqualifying claimant from receiving benefits until 42
consecutive days elapsed after he became available for employment on the ground
that he voluntarily left his employment without good cause and was unavailable
for employment. The referee sustained the amended initial determination, as
modified by the referee to hold that claimant voluntarily left his employment
with good cause from which decision the claimant and the Industrial
Commissioner, respectively, appealed to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is not contended that
in leaving his employment in December 1952 claimant acted arbitrarily or that
he did not have&nbsp;<u>bona fide</u>&nbsp;reasons for doing so. Claimant was
confronted with the choice of either continuing on his job for the sixth
consecutive month or jeopardizing his disability benefits under the Railroad
Retirement Act. While his desire to protect his pension was understandable, it
cannot be said that his leaving under the circumstances was with good cause
within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Law. In resolving the issue of
unavailability against claimant, the referee ruled that to receive unemployment
insurance benefits under the New York Law, a claimant must be willing to forego
Railroad Retirement benefits which restrict employment. He held, in effect,
that claimant's unwillingness to take employment which would cause the stoppage
of these payments was an unreasonable restriction which rendered claimant
unavailable for employment. We find no legal basis to support the referee's
conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>It is clear that
claimant must be deemed to have withdrawn from the labor market during the sixth
consecutive month of any continuous employment. This was true of December 1952,
since, any additional earnings in that month would result in the forfeiture of
this pension. However, it does not follow that his availability continued into
the following five-month period. Here, claimant was willing to accept
employment without any restrictions for five consecutive months. There is
nothing in the record to show that under these conditions claimant's chances of
obtaining employment were seriously affected. Significantly, claimant's work
pattern since his return to the labor market in 1951, shows that his chances
were not materially reduced. In view of the underlying reasons for claimant's
imposition of these conditions and the lack of any showing that this would
prevent him from obtaining any employment, it would be inequitable to bar him
from unemployment insurance benefits because he was unwilling to forfeit his
disability pension. Consequently, it must be held that claimant was unavailable
from December 29, 1952, through December 31, 1952, and was available
thereafter. Since it now appears that claimant's pension was cancelled
effective January 1, 1953 there is no basis in any event, for holding him
unavailable for employment subsequent to that date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

waitress at a country club. Her employment terminated when the club ceased
operations in September 1952. On November 23, claimant, as the result of her
own efforts, obtained employment with a golf club and worked only on every
third weekend due to the season of the year. Claimant filed an original claim
for benefits, effective September 2, 1952, and registered for employment. She
accepted two referrals to employment from the employment service. One of the
jobs offered proved unsuitable and in the other instance claimant was not
hired. She attempted to obtain work with several New York City restaurant
chains and restaurants in Long Island City. She followed advertisements in two
newspapers without success. She was at all times ready to accept a six-day a
week job and was willing to forego her weekend employment at the golf club if
she found full-time employment. The local office issued an initial determination,
effective February 9, 1953, ruling claimant was unavailable for employment on
the ground that she was unwilling to accept employment in addition to the
weekend job she then held. Claimant objected to the initial determination and
requested a hearing before the referee. It is from his decision sustaining the
initial determination of the local office that claimant appeals to this Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman";color:black'>: The sole issue in this case is whether or not
claimant was available for employment on and after February 9, 1953. The
referee held that claimant failed to meet the test of availability under the
Law because of her failure to make diligent efforts to find employment.
Although not susceptible of a precise definition, we have long held that &quot;available
for work&quot; means a claimant’s readiness, willingness and ability to
continue to perform work for which he is reasonably fitted by training and
experience (Appeal Board, 2065-40; 2717-40; 5540-41). When a claimant’s
readiness and willingness to accept work is brought into question by his
conduct or other facts indicating possible unavailability, the presence or
absence of efforts to obtain employment, other than merely registering with the
employment service as required, constitutes overt acts indicative of a
claimant’s state of mind, and is competent evidence to be judged in determining
the probability of claimant’s assertions in the light of the established and
admitted facts (Appeal Board, 6759-42). The claimant in this case did not rely
solely upon the employment service for employment. On her own initiative she
obtained employment which, due to the season of the year, was but intermittent.
She accepted a referral to a six-day a week job but was not hired. She
canvassed restaurant chains where she thought she had a possibility of
obtaining employment. Under such circumstances, we believe that claimant has
fully complied with all of the provisions of the Law and met the test laid down
by the statute. The record fails to disclose any facts or circumstances that
occurred after February 9, 1953, to sustain the conclusion that claimant’s
availability for employment was any different after that day than before that
day. There is but one other point to comment upon. The referee made a finding
that the claimant was not registered with a private employment agency. This
fact may or may not have been persuasive in leading the referee to his
conclusion that claimant did not exert sufficient efforts to find employment.
Although we have indicated that where a claimant registers with a private
employment agency it might be some evidence of an effort to find employment, it
does not follow that when a claimant fails to register with a private agency
that it is any evidence of a lack of diligence on her part in seeking employment
(See Appeal Board, 36,751-53).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
